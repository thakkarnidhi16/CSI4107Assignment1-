<HEAD>Drug Raids in Two States Net Cocaine, Illicit Drug Lab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Separate drug busts in Methuen, Mass., and San Diego and Lake
City, Calif., netted 1,900 pounds of cocaine and chemicals to make
some 2,500 pounds of methamphetamine, authorities said Friday.
   In Massachusetts, federal agents Friday seized 1,200 pounds of
cocaine.
   Four Colombian nationals were arrested following the noon raid,
which culminated a two-year investigation into international drug
trafficking, said Drug Enforcement Agency Special Agent John Coleman.
   U.S. Customs officials seized the cocaine at a public storage
facility in Methuen. The shipment had been destined for the New York
City area, said Leonard Walton, special agent in charge of the
Customs Service's Boston office. He said more arrests were expected
but declined to give details.
   In California, more than 700 pounds of cocaine stashed in two
pickup trucks were seized when authorities intercepted the alleged
smugglers during a Thursday night crossing into the United States
from Mexico, officials said Friday.
   Agents of the San Diego County Integrated Narcotics Task Force,
acting on information gathered during a three-month undercover
investigation, staked out the San Ysidro Port of Entry and waited
for the vehicles to cross, said San Diego police Lt. Skip DiCerchio.
   Eight boxes stuffed with hundreds of 1-pound packages of cocaine
were found in the trucks, DiCerchio said, along with $23,000 in cash.
   The men were booked for investigation of conspiracy to import
cocaine and conspiracy to import a controlled substance.
   Elsewhere in California, authorities said they plan to issue
arrest warrants next week for five people in the discovery of a lab
where drug agents found enough chemicals to make some 2,500 pounds
of methamphetamine, or speed.
   Modoc County Sheriff Bruce Mix said the lab and chemicals were
discovered earlier this week in a raid near Lake City, about 300
miles northeast of Sacramento near the California-Nevada line.

   A 9-year-old girl wrapping Christmas
presents was killed when her younger brother picked up a shotgun and
the weapon accidentally discharged, authorities said.
   Amorita I. Arias was wrapping the presents on a bed at their home
about 5:30 p.m. Thursday when her 7-year-old brother came into the
room and picked up the 12-gauge shotgun, said Lewis County Coroner
Terry Wilson.
   ``Whether he bumped it or actually pulled the trigger, I don't
know,'' Wilson said.
   The blast from 3 to 5 feet away killed the girl instantly.
   ``All the investigation that we've done proves that it was
accidental,'' Wilson said.

   They are pulled from dirty pockets, tattered and
scribbled upon, then consulted like road maps to the compassionate
heart of the city. Want a free meal? Medical care? Counseling? A
place to sober up?
   For the homeless in New York City, the answers can be found in
Street Sheets, a sort of Yellow Pages for the down-and-out.
   All but unknown to most New Yorkers, Street Sheets have become an
institution among the homeless since their introduction in the
autumn of 1986. The single-sheet listings, printed on durable,
non-rip paper, are treasured, memorized, copied and passed from hand
to hand in shelters, soup kitchens and street corners around the
city.
   ``They're legendary,'' said Bill Batson, who runs the Grand
Central Food Program for the Coalition for the Homeless. ``The
people that I know that are surviving the best and seem like they
have the best chance of improving themselves are equipped with
Street Sheets.''
   From an initial printing of 6,300 and listings covering one
neighborhood of Manhattan, Street Sheets have grown to a planned
circulation of 70,000 this year, with listings covering all of
Manhattan and the South Bronx, at a cost of $35,000. The 1989
Manhattan listings will hit the streets this weekend.
   Street Sheets are the work of Suzanne Firtko, 45, an
architectural historian who got the idea while working as a
volunteer in a soup kitchen at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
   Customers continually asked for names of other places to get free
meals or other assistance. ``I began to find that this was very
difficult information to find _ that there was no organized way to
find out where they can go,'' Ms. Firtko recalled in an interview.
   So she began to collect information, relying on tips from
homeless people and her own investigations, until she had a list of
54 places on Manhattan's Upper West Side that offered help to the
homeless.
   Then she applied her own criteria, visited each place and
eliminated all but 26.
   Ms. Firtko excluded any place that required a referral from a
social service agency _ a common stipulation among providers of care
to the homeless. The referral process, she said, is stressful and
difficult for many homeless people; she wanted places that were ``no
hassle.''
   The first batch of Street Sheets, providing listings for the
Upper West Side only, were snapped up in five days, Ms. Firtko said.
Paper for the listings was provided by the DuPont Corp.; money for
printing came from a private benefactor.
   After a second printing of the Upper West Side list, Ms. Firtko
came out with a separate list for Harlem. Then, last December, after
incorporating as a non-profit organization and receiving
contributions from foundations and corporations, she expanded Street
Sheets to include editions for the East Side, the Lower East Side
and the Chelsea-Clinton neighborhood.
   Last year's printing run was 60,000, and demand for the listings
was ``overwhelming,'' Ms. Firtko said. Estimates of the number of
homeless in the city vary; the Coalition for the Homeless says there
are 60,000 to 80,000, while city officials say they provide shelter
to about 27,000 and cannot guess how many others have no home.
   Street Sheets, which are designed to be useful even for those who
can't read, list services beneath symbols for hot food, pantries,
clothes and help.
   Pantries distribute groceries to those in welfare hotels; the
``help'' category includes legal aid, health care, dental care and
drug and alcohol detoxification centers.
   Most of the listings are for private services, many of them run
by churches. ``You could use the Street Sheet to totally circumvent
the welfare system and the (city-run) shelter system,'' Ms. Firtko
said.
   Although she is critical of city services for the homeless, the
feelings are apparently not mutual. Mayor Edward Koch gave Ms.
Firtko one of his Mayor's Voluntary Service Awards earlier this year.
   Ms. Firtko also hears from homeless people who offer thanks _ and
suggestions _ for ``Street Sheets.''
   Among the likely recipients of the latest printing will be a man
who calls himself Eli. Sitting at a table inside a Manhattan
building atrium last week, he reached into a pocket and pulled out a
handful of old Street Sheets.
   He has no need for them anymore; he's memorized them. ``I just
keep them around in case I meet someone who's new to the street,''
Eli explained. ``I'll give them one, help them out.''
   Still, he and his partner, Jay, double-checked the Street Sheet
for the address of a nearby soup-kitchen _ just to make sure. Then
they headed back onto the street, a hot meal a few blocks away.

<HEAD>Davis Sentenced To 5 to 15 Years On Weapons Charges From Police
Shootout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who wounded six police officers in a wild
shootout that triggered a national manhunt was sentenced Thursday to
five to 15 years on weapons charges stemming from the gun battle.
   Larry Davis, 22, was acquitted of nine counts of attempted murder
in the 1986 gunfight with police in the Bronx, eliciting a firestorm
of criticism from politicians and elected officials.
   A defiant Davis was ringed by eight court officers when the
sentence was handed down.
   Earlier, he had questioned the integrity of Acting State Supreme
Court Justice Bernard Fried, and during a 15-minute speech, he
called Fried his ``persecutor'' and said ``you have violated the law
several times.''
   ``I believe you have tried to pre-try my case ... even though you
are supposed to be neutral,'' he told the judge.
   Davis' attorney, William Kunstler, called it a ``racist
sentence'' and immediately appealed it. Davis must serve at least
five years before parole.
   Davis opened his comments by thanking Allah, his family, friends,
supporters and attorneys. He rolled up his shirtsleeve and pants leg
to show injuries allegedly inflicted by corrections officers.
   ``I am not some racist brutal beast or killer that the drug
trafficking police are trying to paint me as,'' he said. ``I
challenge you to give me the same sentence as you would give your
own son.''
   Fried sat impassively during Davis' speech but called him a
``violent, gun- carrying drug dealer'' as he gave him five to 15
years concurrent on each of two counts of criminal possession of a
weapon with intent to use, and 1 2-3 to five years on three counts
of weapons possession to run concurrent with the five to 15 year
term.
   Fried threw out one weapons conviction because of a legal
technicality.
   Dozens of Davis' supporters attended the hearing, as did several
of the officers shot by Davis, including Detective Thomas McCarren,
who had labeled the verdict acquitting Davis as racist.
   Before sentencing, McCarren told Fried he believed Davis was a
cold-blooded killer with no character.
   Davis was found innocent of the attempted murder counts and six
counts of aggravated assault on Nov. 20 by a Bronx state Supreme
Court jury, his second acquittal in nine months.
   Regardless of the sentence handed down Thursday, Davis will
likely remain in custody pending two more trials. Fried could have
given Davis a maximum of 10 to 20 years on the charges.
   Kunstler had suggested his client should receive no time or the
same sentence as Bernhard Goetz _ six months. Goetz was acquitted of
attempted murder but convicted on weapons charges for the shooting
of four teens on a Manhattan subway train.
   The trial focused on the Nov. 19, 1986, shootout between police
and Davis in his sister's Bronx apartment. Six officers were wounded
in the exchange; Davis escaped unscathed through an adjoining
apartment's window, setting off a 17-day national manhunt.
   Kunstler argued that the police, without a warrant, came to the
apartment intent on killing Davis, who fired in self-defense when
the officers opened fire on him without provocation.
   Prosecutors contended Davis fired first as he resisted arrest by
police seeking him as a suspect in the slayings of four suspected
drug dealers. Davis was acquitted of murder charges in that case on
March 3.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward had
denounced the jury verdict in the second Davis trial in the days
following his acquittal.
   Prior to the sentencing, about 1,500 city police officers
incensed by the David verdict turned out in front of the Bronx
County Courthouse to call for the maximum jail time.
   Davis still faces a murder charge in Manhattan and another in the
Bronx, as well as charges of kidnapping and assault in the Bronx and
car theft on Long Island.

   Sten Andersson smiled at the television in his
hotel suite when it carried the news that ended months of secret
meetings, and last-minute quibbles over words in two languages not
his own.
   The Swedish foreign minister guided the diplomacy culminating in
the U.S. agreement to talk to the PLO, which Secretary of State
George P. Shultz announced Wednesday night.
   Sweden's effort to bring the United States and the Palestine
Liberation Organization together began on a trip Andersson made to
the Middle East in March. During that visit he saw the Palestinian
uprising, now a year old, against Israeli rule in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``I met with about 100 boys shot by Israeli soldiers, some of
them paralyzed for life,'' he told reporters Thursday.
   The 64-year-old Swedish diplomat went to Jordan after Israel, and
talks with two PLO leaders convinced him they wanted a separate
Palestinian state rather than the destruction of Israel Palestinians
had preached for decades.
   Egyptians, Saudi Arabians and envoys from several European
nations were involved in negotiations that followed. Andersson said
he met with Vernon A. Walters, Washington's ambassador to the United
Nations, and hinted to the journalists of contacts with Shultz.
   He said Sweden acted as ``a postman'' delivering messages, but
added: ``I confess we have written some of the letters, too.''
   Eugene Makhlouf, PLO delegate to Stockholm, said the Swedes did
most of the diplomatic maneuvering. ``They worked very hard until we
achieved this result,'' he said just after the Shultz announcement.
   Andersson described his role to a few reporters early Thursday
morning, and at a crowded news conference later. He told the news
conference he approached American Jews, not Israelis, because he did
not want the Israeli government to know about his activities in
advance.
   ``The most crucial event was the meeting with the Jewish
personalities from the United States,'' attended by Khalid el-Hassan
of the PLO, ``a fortnight before (PLO Chairman Yasser) Arafat came
to Stockholm,'' Andersson said.
   Rita Hauser, a prominent member of the Republican Party, led the
American Jewish delegation at the secret meeting. El-Hassan is a
leading figure in the PLO and a confidant of Arafat.
   After the meeting, the foreign minister said, he wrote a document
expressing the agreements reached and both sides agreed to sign it.
The document was not made public until last week, when Arafat
visited Stockholm to meet with Ms. Hauser and other American Jews.
   Most of the meeting with Arafat dealt with strategy for
persuading the U.S. government to deal with the PLO.
   Andersson's last maneuvers were performed Wednesday afternoon,
when he settled arguments over which words in English and Arabic the
United States would accept in Arafat's announcement that he
renounced terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist.
   On Tuesday, U.S. officials had said a speech by Arafat to the
U.N. General Assembly in Geneva did not meet American conditions for
contacts with the PLO.
   That speech and his statement Wednesday seemed much the same, but
Andersson said Arafat's remarks at the news conference, in English,
cleared up questions of language that had disturbed the Americans.
   He said all the ideas expressed Wednesday were in Arafat's speech
in Arabic a day earlier, but were ``split up and in different
words.''
   Arabs have a different way of making speeches than Americans, the
Swedish diplomat observed: ``They use a lot of words. A lot of words
always cause confusion, misunderstanding. ... If he (Arafat) changes
the words, the Americans say `What's going on here?'.''
   Arafat said in the speech, for instance, that he ``condemned''
terrorism, and at the news conference that he ``renounced'' it.
   Makhlouf said one word covers for both concepts in Arabic. The
PLO representative added that another element contributed to the
delay in a favorable response from Washington: ``They didn't believe
their ears yesterday (Tuesday). They needed to hear it again.''
   Andersson, whose diplomatic involvement with the Arab-Israeli
conflict covers 25 years, said he felt the U.S. decision was an
important step in breaking the Middle East stalemate.
   ``The beginning of peace is always dialogue, but it has a long
way to go,'' he said.

   For the second time in four months, Three Mile
Island Unit 1 nuclear plant was scheduled for shutdown Thursday to
service one of four pumps that circulate water through the reactor
coolant system.
   The work is expected to be done in about 10 days, said Doug
Bedell, a spokesman for General Public Utilities Corp., which
operates TMI.
   The decision to shut down was made after plant operators
monitored a higher-than-normal water flow through one of three seals
around the pump shaft, Bedell said in a statement.
   The seal will be examined and any necessary corrective action
will be taken, he said.
   Unit 1 was shut down Sept. 17 for nine days for maintenance on
the same pump seal.

   A homeless man who escaped from a mental

platform into a train's path, critically injuring the woman, police
said.
   Edward Jones, 34, was chased and captured by an off-duty
Philadelphia police officer and a citizen after the attack Thursday,
said detective Capt. Michael Mongelluzzo.
   ``He pushed her off from the platform ... in front of a westbound

and knees, and massive blood loss, Mongelluzzo said.
   She was listed in critical and unstable condition at the Hospital
of the University of Pennsylvania, Mongelluzzo said.
   Jones was reported missing from the Philadelphia State Hospital
on June 22, Mongelluzzo said.
   ``He's a street person now. He's mentally deranged,'' he said.
   Jones was held on charges of aggravated and simple assault,
risking a catastrophe and recklessly endangering another person.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers, insurance companies, contractors
and the oil industry are trying to make a pre-emptive strike against
raising the gasoline tax to cut the federal budget deficit.
   The highway lobby presented its arguments at a news conference
Thursday, saying such a tax increase would be unfair to the poor and
to residents of rural areas. It also claimed that an increase would
soak up money needed to repair the nation's highways and bridges.
   The news conference was sponsored by The Road Information
Project, which is financed by companies with a vested interest in
highways. It presented four former Federal Highway Administration
chiefs to argue against reducing the deficit by raising the gas tax.
   Ray Barnhart, Frank C. Turner, Norbert Tiemann and John Hassell
all said any gas-tax increase needs to be earmarked to repair roads
and bridges. They cited estimates that 60 percent of the nation's
paved roads and 42 percent of its bridges are substandard.
   Some members of the National Economic Commission, which was
created to recommend ways to reduce the $155-billion budget deficit,
have urged an increase of up to 50 cents in the gas tax. Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, has said he could support an increase of 10 or 15 cents _
if President-elect Bush should propose it.
   But Bush has said repeatedly he opposes any tax increase to cut
the deficit, and he specifically rejects boosting the gas tax.
   Virtually all the tax, now 9.1 cents a gallon, is earmarked for
highways, bridges and mass transit; none goes into the fund that
pays for general government services.
   Each one-cent increase in the gasoline tax would raise about $1
billion, although economists say a major boost in the tax likely
would produce a smaller per-gallon payoff because people would drive
less.

<TEXT>
   More than 3 percent of the nation's hospitals
had death rates among their Medicare patients last year that
exceeded federal projections.
   A little more than 6 percent of hospitals had
lower-than-projected mortality rates.
   The annual report card of nearly 6,000 hospitals issued Thursday
by the Health Care Financing Administration found that 188 hospitals
had an overall mortality rate that exceeded the range predicted by
the agency's elaborate computer model.
   Although the data that goes into the report is based on about 10
million hospital admissions, HCFA officials cautioned that the final
product should not be taken as the sole basis for judging the
quality of care at a particular hospital.
   In particular, Dr. William C. Roper said exclusion of a
``severity of illness'' measure for each admission could result in
some inner city public hospitals looking worse in the report than
they really are.
   But on balance, he insisted that a small ``validation'' study in
which researchers used data from the medical records of 44,000 cases
confirms the fundamental soundness of the methodology used to
produce the massive report.
   ``The lack of a further severity of illness screen is not a major
problem,'' said Roper.
   The 188 hospitals with mortality rates above projections in 1987
represented 3.2 percent of the total. In 1986, the comparable
figures were 175 and 3 percent.
   Seventy-five hospitals had higher-than-projected rates for both
years.
   At the other end of the scale, 6.2 percent of the hospitals were
``low outliers'' in 1987, meaning their mortality rates were lower
than projected. That compared with 5.8 percent in this category for
1986.
   Even though the report contains specific figures for each
hospital, HCFA officials did not identify those with mortality rates
above or below projected levels.
   Intended primarily for community use, copies of the reports were
made available by HCFA to public and private state health
organizations, state news media outlets and elderly advocacy
organizations such as the 25-million member American Association of
Retired Persons.
   Roper has been criticized on the one hand for releasing the data
at all and on the other for organizing it in a way that makes it
impossible to use as a simplistic way to ``rank'' hospitals.
   At a news conference Thursday, he said he is more convinced than
ever that the report ``is a valid tool for improving the quality of
the American health care system.''
   ``I am confident it has had a profound impact on focusing
attention on the actual care that is delivered in hospitals,'' he
said. ``There are hospitals today that are not doing things they
were doing formerly but were not doing well. Patients have a better
vehicle for making decisions about the questions they pose and where
they go for care.''

<HEAD>Scientists Trying to Improve Use of Shuttle Fuel Tanks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every time a space shuttle goes up, its fuel
tank costing tens of millions of dollars breaks into little pieces
and falls into the ocean. Now, NASA and a group of universities are
teaming up to stop the waste.
   The space agency and the University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research announced an agreement Thursday to make scientific use of
the tanks once the shuttle is in orbit.
   The fuel tanks, which cost $34 million each, are the only part of
the shuttle system that is not reused. The orbiter goes up like a
rocket and comes down like an airplane; the two booster rockets are
retrieved by waiting ships and towed back into port for
refurbishment.
   The NASA-UCAR agreement calls for placing experiments and
equipment into five selected shuttle tanks, probably beginning in
1991. The experiments will be placed on a pallet in an unpressurized
5,000-cubic-foot area between the inner fuel and oxidizer tanks.
   ``We are not costing the taxpayer one bit,'' said Peter Riva, an
adviser to the university group. ``We are reimbursing NASA for all
costs.''
   The group, a consortium of 58 universities and research
institutions involved in atmospheric and space science research,
eventually hopes to use the spent tanks in orbit. The experiments on
the first five will be conducted on suborbital flights _ in the
minutes after the tanks are released from the orbiter and fall back
through the atmosphere into the Indian Ocean.
   ``All that high-density aluminum is being discarded,'' Riva said.
``It is a far better idea to leave them in orbit to use now or
eventually as platforms and habitats and all sorts of things in
space.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration uses a small
explosive device to start the tanks tumbling after release _ so they
will break into small pieces that burn up in the atmosphere.
   The first experiments will aim at controlling the tanks during
their fall. ``That's crucial to us,'' Riva said. ``We will put on
board some small form of rocket controlled from the ground and try
preliminary roll and yaw experiments on the external tank.''
   Other experiments will measure the density of the atmosphere and
release gases at high altitude to measure their effect _ a step
toward monitoring the decay of the environment.
   Riva said the consortium envisions a budget of $500 million and
will try to recoup some of that by renting space on the pallet to
other experiments. No operational changes will be made in the
shuttle operations and no timetable for flights has been set.
   ``We are not going to cause a single hiccup in NASA's normal
shuttle operation,'' Riva said.
   NASA said several organizations have proposed private uses for
the tanks and that evaluation of the proposals continues.
   The 154-foot-long external tank holds the nearly 1.6 million
pounds of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fuel that is required to
power the shuttle to orbit. The intertank area is 270 inches long,
331 inches in diameter and weighs 12,100 pounds.

   Establishment of a Palestinian state is more
possible now that the United States is talking to the PLO and
inching toward support of a seat for Yasser Arafat's organization in
Mideast peace talks.
   For several reasons, the PLO chairman is being vague about where
the state would be set up. Arafat said in Geneva his state would
exist alongside Israel, but he has not said whether the Palestine he
envisions would cut deeper into the Jewish state.
   Clearly, he wants to take control of the West Bank and Gaza, held
by Israel since 1967 and the home of 1.2 million Palestinian Arabs
and 60,000 Jews. And without question he wants part of Jerusalem,
the Israeli capital.
   But what about a corridor to the Mediterranean Sea? Or other land?
   The PLO chairman has called for implementation of the l947
partition resolution, for instance, that would shrink Israel into a
smaller country than it was before the 1967 Middle East war when it
took the West Bank and Gaza from its Arab neighbors.
   Also, Arafat insists on the right of Palestinians to return to
their ancestral homes.
   At the very least, that would change the composition of Israel,
if not its boundaries.
   Palestinian aspirations are behind these designs, of course. And
not everyone would agree with Secretary of State George P. Shultz
that Arafat is now ready to live in peace with Israel. The more he
can squeeze the country, the weaker it would be.
   Besides, a Palestinian state confined to the West Bank and Gaza
might not be economically viable.
   That was one of the arguments used this year by Shultz in
explaining on four unsuccessful trips to the Middle East why he did
not back establishment of a Palestinian state.
   Now Arafat can use the same argument to expand his territorial
ambitions.
   For one thing, Israel stands between Gaza, on the Mediterranean,
and the West Bank, dividing the residents of the two territories.
Also, the areas are basically agricultural, lack oil and industry
and have no developed seaport. The main resource is the talent and
industry of the Palestinians.
   The Reagan administration, like its predecessors, pressed for a
reabsorption by Jordan of most of the West Bank. In some undefined
way, the aspirations of the Palestinians was supposed to be worked
out through Jordan, with Israel's concurrence.
   But Arafat has never relented in his demand for a separate and
independent state, while all the Arab leaders including King Hussein
of Jordan have supported him in the quest.
   So long as the United States shunned the Palestine Liberation
Organization and opposed a PLO seat in the negotiations as well as a
Palestinian state, the debate was mostly academic.
   But now that President Reagan and Shultz have ordered U.S. talks
with the PLO, the statehood question takes on new urgency.
   Even if Israel stands fast, the way is cleared for Arafat to push
his demands and to insist on a seat at the table and more than an
amorphous ``entity'' on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   On Thursday, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman
struggled with the problem and left the impression U.S. policy on
PLO participation in peace talks was in flux.
   ``The Palestinians have the right to pursue their desire for an
independent state through negotiations,'' he said.
   But he was evasive when asked if it was still the U.S. position
that Palestinians should be part of a joint delegation with Jordan
and not have a seat of their own. Redman's response was: ``I don't
rule out, or in, any particular option.''
   That could indicate that another plank of the U.S. policy on the
PLO was being removed. But Redman leaned in the other direction when
he was pressed further.
   He said ``we would be perfectly happy'' if all of the parties
agreed on a joint delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians, with
the PLO not being part of it.
   Told by a reporter that did not represent a change in U.S.
policy, Redman agreed: ``Absolutely, totally and fully.''

<HEAD>Agriculture Department Resolves To Cure Ham Processing Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has resolved that
the new year will bring an end to a five-year rule-making snag
involving food safety and the processing of old-fashioned country
ham.
   The deadline for ham producers to comply with new federal
regulations was supposed to be Dec. 31, but it has been pushed back
to the final day of 1989. The deadline once was Dec. 31, 1987. And
before that it was Dec. 31, 1986. There also was one on Aug. 6, 1985.
   Now, the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service says it
will stick to a deadline of Dec. 31, 1989 _ or whenever the agency
finally approves the new rules, spokeswoman Irene Goins said
Thursday.
   The lengthy rule-making procedure involves those hams often seen
on grocery shelves in cloth bags or hanging from rafters in country
stores. They must be scrubbed to remove mold and then soaked or
boiled a couple of times to reduce the salt content.
   They're the kind of hams for which someone had to invent red-eye
gravy and, in some parts of the country, grits.
   As the USDA defines them, they're ``uncooked, cured, dried,
smoked or unsmoked pork products made from solid meat.''
   Typically, country or dry-cured hams are treated with salt and
then put in a smokehouse to cure and age, a total process that can
take months or even years.
   Most hams sold in supermarkets are wet-cured quickly in brine
solutions and cooked before sale to consumers.
   In March 1983, the USDA proposed rules intended to help prevent
trichinosis, a disease caused by microscopic parasitic worms, or
trichinae, that can occur in improperly cooked pork. The proposed
rules were directed at ready-to-eat pork products and dry-cured
country hams.
   Shortly after the original proposal was adopted Feb. 6, 1985, the
agency learned that some federally inspected ham producers were
using old-fashioned methods that didn't meet the new USDA
requirements and were ordered to show by Aug. 6, 1985, that their
curing procedures were safe.
   The country ham industry protested, so the USDA allowed more
time. One compelling reason for the extensions of time for
compliance was that no trichina problems had been associated with
the dry-cured hams.
   ``These traditional processing methods have been permitted
because they are decades-old methods believed to be effective in
destroying trichinae,'' says Ronald J. Prucha, acting administrator
of the USDA agency.
   ``We are researching the safety of traditional trichina control
methods and developing a proposed rule for issuance in early 1989,''
he said. ``After we receive public comments on that proposal, we
will develop new regulations.''
   But just in case the USDA's rule-making machine is slower than
officials hope, the compliance deadline was extended another full
year.

   A 17 percent increase in the amount of raw
sugar that can be imported from 39 foreign countries in 1989 has
been announced by the Agriculture Department.
   Deputy Secretary Peter Meyers said Thursday that next year's
quota was set at about 1.24 million short tons of 2,000 pounds each,
up from about 1.06 million tons in calendar 1988.
   In metric tons, which have about 2,205 pounds each, the 1989
quota will be almost 1.13 million tons. Metric units were used to
establish next year's quota to meet the terms of a new U.S. tariff
system, which will take effect Jan. 1.
   The Dominican Republic led the list with a 1989 allocation of
185,328 metric tons, followed by the Philippines, 166,374, and
Brazil, 152,685.
   Reduced production because of this year's drought and rising
demand were the main reasons for boosting the quota so sharply,
officials said.

   Peanut farmers will be allowed a bigger
government quota for their 1989 crop.
   The Agriculture Department said Thursday that the national peanut
marketing quota for 1989 will be 1.44 million tons, up 37,800 tons
from this year's quota.
   The national quota is required by law to be equal to the
estimated quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic
edible, seed and related uses in the 1989-90 marketing year, which
will begin Aug. 1, 1989. The quota cannot be less than 1.1 million
tons.
   Officials said the 1989 poundage quota will be allocated to each
producing state based on the state's share of the 1988 quota.
Increases in a state's quota will be allocated among qualifying
peanut farms.
   Peanut farmers voted in a referendum in January 1986 to continue
quota for crops through 1990.

<HEAD>Court Overturns President's Order To Halt Trial In Beating Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South-West African Supreme
Court has overturned an order by South African President P.W. Botha
to halt the trial of four soldiers accused of fatally beating a
black man, according to news reports.
   The Supreme Court in Windhoek, capital of the South
African-controlled territory also known as Namibia, ruled Botha's
1986 order halting the trial was invalid, newspapers reported
Thursday.
   Botha had relied on a law that said if he determined members of
the security forces were acting in good faith to combat terrorism,
they could not be tried for acts they committed.
   But the court ruled Wednesday that Botha could not legally make
such a decision because he did not receive the proper report about
the case. The court said the report, signed by Defense Minister
Magnus Malan, was ``most misleading,'' and that the investigator
failed to talk to witnesses.
   Mweunhanga Uapota, wife of the dead man, brought the appeal. In
her affidavit she said she, her husband Frans, and some friends were
gathered at a shop in Onengali, in northern Namibia, when soldiers
appeared, forced them to lie down, kicked them, blindfolded and
assaulted her husband.
   The court noted the defendants did not deny the allegations.
   It also noted the post-mortem report, detailing Uapota's
injuries, was not submitted to the president, and he also was not
given information showing Uapota was never involved in terrorism.
   The autopsy report said Uapota died from massive bleeding on the
brain, caused by head injury. It also said he had serious injuries
to the upper abdomen and chest, a broken neck and injuries
``consistent with a rope having been tied around the deceased's
neck.''
   Under an agreement this week among South Africa, Cuba and Angola,
Cuba is to withdraw its troops from Angola, and South-West Africa is
to become independent.
   In other developments:
   _ Piet Rudolph, a leading member of two right-wing pro-apartheid
organizations, was freed on $42 bail Thursday after being charged in
connection with a shooting in downtown Pretoria.
   _ Two limpet mines exploded Thursday in Randfontein, a mining and
commercial center west of Johannesburg, causing slight damage and no
casualties, police reported.
   _ Botha demanded that Free Weekly, a new Afrikaans-language
paper, pay him $42,000 and publish an apology for a story saying he
had dined with an ``infamous Mafia boss.'' The paper refused on
Thursday.

<HEAD>Bush Says He'll Change Rules On Talking With Press</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush is fed up with being
peppered with questions while posing for pictures, and says he won't
let that happen during photo-taking sessions after his inauguration.
   ``Talking at photo ops will continue until Jan. 20 and after that
there will be absolutely none,'' Bush admonished reporters Thursday.
   He told the journalists his new press policy was for their own
good because shouting questions during photo opportunities was
``demeaning to your profession.''
   There was no shouting during the session that sparked Bush's
edict, just a reprise of the usual questions the vice president gets
these days about when he will finish naming his Cabinet.
   Earlier, Bush was asked about Yasser Arafat while he posed for
posterity with Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita.
   While Bush held few news conferences during the campaign, he has
faced reporters for extensive questioning repeatedly since the
election, turning each of his Cabinet announcements into news
conferences.
   He also has been responding to questions at the picture-taking
sessions in the White House with visiting dignitaries, politicians
or guests, where a pool of 10 or 15 reporters, photographers and
camera crews are ushered in for the opening minute.
   The photo opportunity at times has been the White House press
corps' main avenue of communication with President Reagan, who has
held fewer news conferences than any modern president and who often
seemed to enjoy firing off one-liners during these brief encounters
with the press.
   The Reagan administration made an attempt to muzzle reporters
during photo-opportunity sessions, but backed off when the
television networks refused to send in their camera crews without
their correspondents.
   Mary Martin, deputy Washington bureau chief for CBS News, said
Thursday night, ``When information is needed, we're going to ask
questions.''
   But she added, ``If the vice president makes himself available to
answer questions at other times, it becomes less necessary to pursue
your questions at photo opportunities.''
   That may be what Bush has in mind. ``I hope that we can work out
something that's satisfactory to all,'' he said.
   Top aides have said they expect Bush to have frequent, short
contacts with the news media, possibly several times a week.
   ``I'll have other ways of communicating that will be much more
pleasant for you and much more pleasant for me and much more
respectful of our guests like foreign visitors,'' Bush told
reporters.
   Asked if he would hold regular news conferences, Bush said, ``Oh,
sure there'll be news conferences.'' He said they would not be
``regular'' _ ``That idea went out years ago'' _ but ``frequent
ones.''
   ``But not shouted questions,'' he reiterated. ``It's demeaning to
your profession. You shouldn't have to yell at me to get an answer.''
   He said he would permit the shouted questions to continue during
the transition ``because there's a certain fun. I like the give and
take of it. It's humility.''
   But he predicted that ending such situations ``will be a great
relief to the photographers and ... to the serious reporters that
would like answers and not have to yell over a helicopter
someplace.''

<HEAD>Health Dangers Small, Hysteria Large In Soviet Nuclear Accident,
Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychological harm caused by the Chernobyl
nuclear accident is likely to outweigh the other health effects in
the general population, according to the author of a study published
today.
   Marvin Goldman, a professor of radiobiology at the University of
California, Davis, says in his study that the increased risk of
cancer from exposure to airborne radiation from Chernobyl is almost
too small to be measured for the 3 billion people in the northern
hemisphere.
   But the fear caused by the disaster was immense, he said.
   ``This was a major nuclear accident, probably the worst you can
imagine,'' Goldman said in an interview. ``Three billion people were
terrorized.''
   There was just enough general understanding of the disaster to
provoke fear, but not enough to give reassurance, he said.
   Goldman said the fear sprang from ``knowing that the stuff is
radiation, knowing that it's invisible, knowing that the major
consequence is cancer. The Soviets have a word for it _ they call it
radiophobia. They've had a tremendous problem in overcoming this.''
   The increased cancer risk pales in comparison, he said.
   ``The Chernobyl accident was equal to about three years of
background radiation to the population of the northern hemisphere,''
Goldman said.
   The net effect for the 3 billion people in the hemisphere is an
increase in the lifetime chance of dying of cancer of about 0.003
percent, he said.
   For Europeans, who were closer to the accident, he said,
Chernobyl increased cancer risk by about 0.02 percent, an increase
``not worth losing any sleep over.''
   ``We each walk around with about a 20 percent fatal cancer
risk,'' said Goldman. ``For those with a 0.02 percent (risk
increase), it means that instead of a 20 percent risk, it is now
20.02 percent.''
   He said natural radiation will cause about 500,000 people of the
3 billion now living in the northern hemisphere to die of cancer.
The risk estimate added by Chernobyl is calculated to cause an
additional 17,000 deaths, he said.
   ``You couldn't see a number like 17,000 among the 500 million
cancer deaths,'' he said. ``There is no way that such a small
increase could ever be demonstrated epidemiologically.''
   The Chernobyl plant, in the Soviet Union near the city of Kiev,
exploded and burned on April 26, 1986. It spawned a cloud of
radioactive material that swept in a cloud around the globe. The
most immediate effect was near the plant where there were 237 cases
of acute radiation sickness, including 31 deaths.
   Public concern elsewhere was heightened by the problem of whom to
believe: ``which are the real facts and which aren't,'' he said.
   Some governments in Europe overreacted despite the existence of
detailed plans prepared in advance, Goldman said.
   ``As the pressure mounted and press attention grew, all the
numbers and preparations just went out the window. Some governments
took action just to appear to be doing something about it.''
   In many cases, food and crops were destroyed unnecessarily, he
said, and some individual reactions were hysterical.
   Goldman said a German woman called him to ask if she should shoot
her race horse out of fear that the animal would not be able to
breed properly.
   The professor said he reassured her and the horse was spared.
   The study co-authored by Goldman on the Chernobyl accident is
published today in Science, the journal of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science. The other authors were Lynn R.
Anspaugh of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore,
Calif., and Robert J. Catlin of Electric Power Institute in Palo
Alto, Calif.

<HEAD>Security Council Extends Cyprus Peacekeeping Six Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council has extended the U.N.
peacekeeping mission on Cyprus for six months and expressed hope
rival Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities will resolve their
conflict by June.
   After the council voted 15-0 on Thursday to extend the mandate of
the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, representatives of Greece,
Turkey, and the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities debated anew
who began the conflict.
   Turkish Cypriot Representative Ozer Koray accused Greece and the
Greek Cypriot community of ``importing arms from Greece and also
setting up weaponry plants.''
   Cypriot Ambassador Constantine Moushoutas, speaking for Greek
Cypriots, blamed the crisis on ``the Turkish invasion and
occupation.'' He noted past Security Council resolutions call for
withdrawing all foreign troops and settlers from the island.
   In 1974, a coup by Greece's ruling military junta failed on the
island. Turkey invaded the northern part of Cyprus, saying it was
protecting the minority Turkish Cypriot community, and sent
thousands of Turks to settle in the north.
   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in 1975 proclaimed the
northern part of the island an independent Turkish state but the
only diplomatic recognition it has won is from Turkey.
   Cypriot President George Vassiliou, who leads the Greek
community, and Denktash have held a series of talks aimed at setting
up a republic containing both communities.
   The talks have been deadlocked. Another round is scheduled to
begin Monday.
   The U.N. peacekeepers on Cyprus are funded by voluntary
contributions from U.N. member states, but a report to the council
by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said donations have not
been coming in.

<HEAD>Proposed Moratorium On `Let It Burn' Policy Likely To End By May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recommended halt to the government's ``let it
burn'' forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the
Western fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of a
panel that suggested the moratorium.
   The panel, in recommendations Thursday to the secretaries of
agriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits to
allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn.
Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance to
grow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.
   But it also said that ``in some cases the social and economic
effects'' of allowing a forest fire to burn ``may be unacceptable.''
   The panel suggested a temporary halt to the ``let it burn''
policy, saying the Forest Service and the National Park Service
needed more time to refine their fire management plans.
   ``My guess is that the moratorium would be finished by the
beginning of the Western fire season, which is the middle of May,''
Charles Philpot, co-chairman of the review panel, told a news
conference.
   The panel was assembled last September after the worst fire
season ever in drought-primed Yellowstone National Park. Some 249
fires seared 706,278 acres within the park boundaries and 40 percent
as much again in nearby national forests.
   Residents in the fire vicinity complained bitterly that the park,
tourism and the very air they breathed were being ruined by the
failure to control the fires.
   The review team was asked to look at policies throughout the
national parks and wilderness areas, not just Yellowstone. However,
it did not consider policies in other areas such as ordinary
national forests, where the Forest Service tries to protect
commercial timbering operations.
   The panel's report will remain open for public comment for 60
days before any recommendations are adopted.
   The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas
should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are
improved and strengthened.
   It said actual fire management plans often have not spelled out
when natural fires would be allowed to burn and when they would be
put out.
   The agencies involved should make sure that fire management plans
conform to departmental policies, that employees understand the
policies, that everybody is using a common vocabulary and that
agencies have agreed beforehand what to do if fires threaten to move
across administrative boundaries, the report said.
   ``No ... natural fires are to be allowed until fire management
plans meet these standards,'' the report said.
   Plans should consider the effects of prolonged drought, fuel
moisture content and the possibility that multiple fires will tie up
fire-fighting resources, the report said.
   Another recommendation called for the responsible agency official
to ``certify in writing daily that adequate resources are available
to ensure'' that every natural fire will be kept within boundaries
set by government authorities.

<TEXT>
   Increased awareness of drinking problems and
tougher drunk-driving laws and enforcement are most likely
responsible for a decline in the proportion of fatal crashes related
to alcohol, U.S. health officials said.
   Even so, more than half of last year's 46,386 traffic fatalities
died in accidents involving alcohol, indicating the problem of
drunken driving remains a serious one, the national Centers for
Disease Control reported Thursday.
   ``This is one of those problems that has been going on for a long
time in the United States,'' said Dr. Richard Waxweiler, chief of
the epidemiology branch at the CDC's Division of Injury Epidemiology
and Control.
   ``It's not like some new disease or epidemic that grabs
everybody's attention.''
   In 1987, 23,632 people were killed in the United States in motor
vehicle crashes in which alcohol was involved, or 51 percent of all
U.S. traffic fatalities, the CDC said. That compares with 25,165
killed in 1982 in alcohol-related crashes, or 57 percent of the
43,945 traffic fatalities that year.
   The number of deaths in accidents in which no one had been
drinking rose from 18,780, or 43 percent, in 1982 to 22,754, or 49
percent, in 1987. Conversely, the deaths in the most strongly
alcohol-related accidents _ those in which at least one party tested
above .10 on a blood-alcohol test _ declined from 20,356, or 46
percent, in 1982 to 18,529, or 40 percent, in 1987, according to
statistics from the NHTSA data.
   The proportion of alcohol-related traffic fatalities may have
fallen, the CDC said, because of three factors: ``increased public
awareness of the problem, enactment of more stringent laws and
increased enforcement ... and laws that raised the drinking age to
21 in all states.''
   Although exact figures were not presented, the CDC noted that the
proportion of drivers intoxicated at the time of a fatal crash fell
17 percent from 1982 to 1987, and the proportion of teen-age drunken
drivers involved in fatal crashes fell 34 percent.

<HEAD>Studies Suggest Gene Alteration May Help Treat Some Cancers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies at two California laboratories suggest
that genetically altered cells may help limit the growth of some
cancers and help correct brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
   The experiments in two laboratories at the University of
California, San Diego involved the use of cells that were
genetically altered and then injected or grafted into laboratory
animals, according to reports published today.
   In a study of cancer, Wen-Hwa Lee, a professor of pathology at
UCSD, said a cancer-suppressing gene was inserted into the altered
genetic pattern of a retrovirus, a type of virus that controls the
genetic pattern of a normal cell.
   The retrovirus carrying the cancer-suppressing retinoblastoma
gene, or RB, was then transplanted into cancer cells.
   To serve as a comparison, another type of gene, called
luciferase, or LUX, was processed in the same way.
   Lee said both types of altered cancer cells then were injected
into nude mice, a type of laboratory rodent that lacks an immune
system and is highly susceptible to developing cancer. Each of seven
mice received both kinds of the altered cells, one type in each rear
flank, he said.
   After a month the flanks injected with the LUX-infected cells
developed tumors, Lee said. No tumors, however, grew on the flanks
that had received the RB-infected cells.
   It appears that the virus carrying the cancer-suppressing gene is
able to prevent the formation of malignant cells, Lee said. It
suggests that this technique could be used to genetically convert
malignant tumor cells, which grow very rapidly, to cells that grow
normally, he said.
   ``After the tumor cell received this virus,'' said Lee, ``the
tumor cell would lose its malignancy. Therefore, it would stop
growing, or phase into a normal cell.''
   He said this holds promise for development withi five years of a
``novel strategy for the treatment of malignancy.''
   Lee said cells receiving the RB gene would be blocked permanently
from turning into cancer and that the virus carrying the gene could
contribute this turmor suppression to other cells.
   He said the technique using the RB gene theoretically could work
in treatment of breast, bone and lung cancer, and a rare type of eye
cancer in children. The absence of the RB gene has been linked to
all these types of cancers.
   In another UCSD experiment, Theodore Friedmann, professor of
pediatrics, said he and a group of researchers grafted genetically
altered cells into the brains of rats to produce a special protein
called nerve growth factor that prevented damaged brain tissue from
dying.
   The work, he said, ``is the first demonstration of this sort of
combination of genetic modification of cells and grafting as an
approach to central nervous system disease.''
   Friedmann said the researchers disarmed a retrovirus by removing
part of its genetic pattern. A gene that carries instructions for
the production of nerve growth factor was then put into the pattern
of the retrovirus.
   Next, the team put the altered retrovirus into cells called
fibroblasts. These fibroblasts now had the genetic instructions for
producing nerve growth factor.
   The scientists then made surgical lesions in the brains of 16
rats, cutting the connection between the forebrain and the
hippocampus. Normally, this would cause the degeneration of
cholinergic cells, a type of brain tissue that requires the
nourishment of nerve growth factor.
   Eight of the rats received brain grafts containing fibroblasts
altered to produce nerve growth factor. The other rats received
grafts of unaltered fibroblasts.
   After two weeks, both groups of rats were killed and autopsied.
   Friedmann said the rats that received the unaltered fibroblasts
experienced a loss of 51 percent of their cholinergic cells. But the
rats that had received the fibroblasts carrying the nerve growth
factor gene lost only 8 percent of their cholinergic cells.
   He said the importance of the study is that it demonstrates that
brain conditions caused by a shortage of certain proteins could
perhaps be corrected by grafting genetically altered cells that
produce this protein.
   ``You would have this little factory close to the lesion which is
pouring out the material in a stable, permanent way,'' Friedmann
said.
   ``The long-range implications from this study,'' he said, is that
``one can start thinking about treating diseases that are a result
of gene defects in the brain at the level of the gene defect.''
   Among the disorders that may one day benefit from this type of
therapy, he said, are Alzheimer's disease, some types of mental
retardation and cerebral palsy, and genetically based degeneration
diseases.
   Both studies were published today in Science, the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Pentagon Kills Plan To Charge For Military Medical Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has killed
a White House proposal to charge military dependents and retirees a
fee for health care, sources said.
   The sources, who spoke Thursday on condition they not be
identified, said Carlucci had intervened personally with officials
at the Office of Management and Budget to scuttle the idea.
   ``OMB is backing down,'' one ranking Pentagon official said.
``This plan will be scrapped.''
   The Pentagon's chief spokesman, Dan Howard, declined to say
Thursday whether OMB had agreed to discard the plan. But Howard made
it clear that Carlucci had fought the budget office over the matter.
   ``The secretary understands that the military member and his
family count medical care in the system as one of their most
important fundamental benefits,'' Howard said.
   ``An increase and change in charging fees to our service
personnel would constitute a decrease in their net pay and benefits
package. And changing this benefit would be a breach of faith with
our military service members, their families and our retirees, and
have a negative effect on attracting and retaining quality
personnel.''
   Earlier this week, defense officials disclosed that OMB was
pressing the Pentagon to begin levying user fees starting next Oct.
1. The sources, who claimed Pentagon officials were going
``bananas'' over the prospect of the user fees, said the plan was
advanced by OMB for inclusion in the Defense Department's fiscal
1990 budget proposal. The budget is scheduled to be submitted to
Congress on Jan. 9.
   Under the plan, military dependents and retirees would have been
charged $10 for every outpatient doctor visit up to an annual
ceiling of $100; $3 to have prescriptions filled; and $50 for
admission to a military hospital.
   Men and women on active duty would not have been affected, nor
would the dependents of enlisted personnel in the bottom four
enlisted ranks.
   In addition, the plan called for a doubling of the annual
insurance deductible for dependents and retirees who turn to private
physicians instead of using military facilities. The so-called
CHAMPUS insurance deductibles would have increased from $50 to $100
for individuals and $100 to $200 for families.
   Currently, military dependents and retirees are allowed to use
military hospitals on a ``space available'' basis, with active-duty
personnel always having priority. But when a dependent or retiree is
admitted to a hospital or uses other services, the only fee he or
she pays is a nominal subsistence fee for food while hospitalized.

   A ``sweet old lady'' who played the stock

more than $30,000 in her will, her daughter said.
   Ann Roselle Hundley Hayne, who was 87 when she died June 15,
received a total of $45,000 in monthly Social Security payments
during the last 20 years of her life.
   ``She believed in giving back from whence it came,'' said her
niece, Marjorie Hughey, who would not say how much her aunt's estate
was worth.
   Mrs. Hayne also left thousands to Christ Episcopal Church, the
Disabled American Veterans and the Rockefeller Foundation, according
to her recently executed will.
   A check for $30,707 was forwarded to Social Security headquarters
in Baltimore, Md., and deposited in a general trust fund, said Joe
Black, assistant manager of the Pensacola Social Security office.
   Mrs. Hayne's husband, who died of yellow fever in Africa in the
1930s, had worked for the Rockefeller Foundation, which granted Mrs.
Hayne a lifetime pension upon her husband's death.

   The Energy Department acknowledges it may not
have won friends on Capitol Hill by spending $1.3 million to send
17,000 copies of a 23-volume report on the superconducting super
collider.
   The action has alienated at least one House member already.
   ``At a time when we're looking for ways to reduce federal
spending, this is just absurd,'' Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said
Thursday. ``Some federal bureaucrats just don't use common sense.''
   Hastert, whose district includes a rejected collider site,
suggested lawmakers who doubt Energy Secretary John Herrington
considered costs in picking Texas to house the $4.4 billion atom
smasher may be even more skeptical now.
   `I understand where the argument is coming from,'' department
spokesman Jeff Sherwood said. ``I don't know who made the ultimate
decision. But if we hadn't distributed (the report), we would have
been criticized for that as well.''
   At issue is an 8,000-page environmental impact statement on
proposed collider sites in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan,
North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
   The department sent copies of the statement to everyone who
testified at hearings on the project or submitted written comments
on any of the finalist sites, Sherwood said.

<HEAD>Life Expectancy For Blacks Drops Second Consecutive Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The life expectancy for blacks has dropped for
two consecutive years for the first time since 1970, when mortality
data was first broken down by race, according to a federal report.
   While the white population experienced an increase in life
expectancy, to a record high of 75.4 years, from 1985 to 1986, the
black rate declined to 69.4 years, the same level as in 1982.
   Despite that most recent two-year decline, the report notes that
``the largest gain in life expectancy between 1970 and 1986 was for
both black males and females, 5.2 years, followed by white males, 4
years, and white females, 3.2 years.''
   The annual figures, released recently by the National Center for
Health Statistics, are derived from comparing U.S. Bureau of the
Census data with death certificates filed in the 50 states and
District of Columbia.
   The 55-page report makes no attempt at explaining any of the
trends shown by the figures. However, the tables show there was a 15
percent increase in homicides among blacks between 1985 and 1986,
compared to a 5 percent increase among whites.

   Dan Quayle was so bored in the House of
Representatives that he missed committee meetings to play golf or
work out, according to a new book on the vice president-elect.
   However, the book, by political scientist Richard F. Fenno Jr.,
says Quayle quickly matured when he moved to the Senate in 1980 and
risked alienating the Republican administration to engineer passage
of an important bipartisan job training bill.
   The freshman Republican senator was so irritated at roadblocks to
the bill thrown up by Labor Department officials and then-Secretary
Raymond Donovan that he referred to them as ``the bastards,'' the
book says.
   ``The Making of a Senator: Dan Quayle'' is a six-year study by
Fenno of Quayle's political career and his chief legislative
accomplishment, the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982. It is
published by Congressional Quarterly.
   Quayle's office said there would be no comment on the book.

<TEXT>
   A woman physician who has been jailed for 16
months for refusing to allow her ex-husband to visit their daughter
has lost a bid to be released.
   Superior Court Judge Herbert B. Dixon said Thursday that
additional jail time may yet convince Dr. Elizabeth Morgan to change
her position.
   ``This court is convinced that the coercion has only begun,''
Dixon said. ``As each day passes, the waste of Dr. Morgan's personal
and professional life becomes more apparent.''
   Dixon jailed Morgan on contempt of court charges in August 1987,
when she hid her then-5-year-old daughter, Hilary, rather than allow
her to go on a court-ordered visit with her father, northern
Virginia oral surgeon Eric Foretich. Morgan alleged that Foretich
had sexually abused Hilary repeatedly in the past and would do so
again.
   Morgan's attorneys argued that because Morgan firmly believed
Foretich would abuse the girl, the ``coercive'' intent of jailing
her clearly had failed.
   Dixon, however, noting that Morgan's plastic surgery practice has
been closed, said the personal costs of further incarceration might
convince her to allow Foretich visitation rights under one of
several compromises issued by his attorney.
   ``She has the opportunity to break this impasse, but as time
passes that opportunity may be lost,'' Dixon said. ``She holds the
keys to her freedom.''
   Dixon said that at some undetermined future date, he might free
Morgan if he concludes that the coercive intent of the contempt
jailing has failed.
   ``That could be in a month, that could be in a year,'' Dixon
said. ``But it could be more than that.''
   Morgan, dressed in bright orange prison coveralls, sat motionless
as Dixon read his ruling. Afterward, she quietly thanked her
attorneys before being led off by a U.S. marshal.
   ``I think what we saw here today is the ugly face of the law,''
said Stephen Sachs, one of Morgan's attorneys.
   Hilary remains hidden at an undisclosed location. During the
two-day hearing that preceded Dixon's ruling, Morgan rebuffed
numerous questions about the child, saying only that she was
``healthy, happy and healing.''
   Morgan said she decided to hide Hilary only after the girl
repeatedly complained of being abused and told therapists she was
considering suicide.
   While she has been in jail, Morgan's home has been sold to pay
some of her legal costs. She faces legal debts of about $1.5 million.

   Lord Plumb, president of the European
Parliament, signed the European Economic Community's 1989 budget
into law.
   The budget, signed Thursday, amounts to $52.8 billion, with
farm-spending set at $31.5 billion, or 56 percent of the total.
   It was the first time agriculture payments were kept to under 60
percent of the budget since the EEC, or Common Market, was founded
31 years ago. The lower agriculture figure was the result of a deal
hammered out by the 12 EEC leaders in Brussels in February to
strictly control farm payments.
   The cut was made possible by higher-than-forecast world cereal
prices and a cheaper U.S. dollar.

   Rock star Bruce Springsteen's three-year
marriage to Julianne Phillips will end March 1 when their divorce
takes effect, the actress's manager says.
   ``It was a fair settlement but terms will be confidential,''
Molly Madden said Thursday in announcing the divorce had been
granted.
   Miss Phillips, 28, filed for divorce Aug. 30, citing
irreconcilable differences with Springsteen, 39.
   They were married in her hometown of Lake Oswego, Ore., on May
1985, seven months after meeting backstage during a Springsteen
concert here.
   Springsteen recently has been linked romantically to Patti
Scialfa, a backup singer in his band.
   Madden said Miss Phillips is anxious to get back to a career that
``had been put on hold'' during her marriage.
   The manager said Miss Phillips will star in two movies next year,
Universal's ``Fletch Lives'' with Chevy Chase and 20th Century Fox's
``Skin Deep,'' starring John Ritter.

   Ivan Boesky will have to return to a

   The former arbitrageur's wife, Seema, wanted to cap their 17-room
Georgian mansion here with a dome similar to the one atop Thomas
Jefferson's Monticello home in Charlottesville, Va.
   But her plans were opposed by 11 neighbors in this New York City
suburb and on Wednesday night the North Castle Zoning Board of
Appeals voted 3-2 to deny her request for permission to build the
dome.
   Mrs. Boesky needed special permission from the board because her
plans would have added a third floor to the house, which is at the
center of a 76-acre estate called Northview. North Castle zoning law
limits buildings to 2{ stories.
   Boesky paid a record $100 million fine in 1986 to settle federal
Securities and Exchange Commission charges of insider stock trading.
He is serving a three-year term after pleading guilty in April 1987
to a federal conspiracy charge, and will be eligible for parole in

   The city's police chief said he appealed ``as
a father'' to a distraught postal worker whom he recognized as an
acquaintance and persuaded to surrender after the gunman shot three
people and took a hostage.
   A psychiatric evaluation was ordered Thursday for Warren Murphy,
39, who was charged with assault with intent to commit murder during
the 13-hour ordeal at the main New Orleans post office.
   Murphy gave himself up late Thursday morning and released his
hostage, a 29-year-old postal worker described as his girlfriend,
said police spokeswoman Carmine Menchel. The hostage, Carol Smith,
was not harmed.
   Three people were shot during the ordeal but none was in serious
condition, hospital spokesmen said.
   New Orleans Police Chief Warren Woodfork, who talked Murphy into
surrendering, said the suspect was concerned about his marital
breakup and the welfare of his children who reportedly were in his
estranged wife's custody in Washington.
   ``I just tried to appeal to him as a father,'' said Woodfork.
``We have a lot in common. He has kids. I have kids. Our sons played
football together.
   ``So I can understand if he was concerned about his children,''
Woodfork said.
   During the two hours of negotiations, Woodfork said Murphy told
him he also was worried that police would try to shoot him if he
stepped from the building.
   ``I told him I'd meet him halfway, and when he walked out I was
there,'' Woodfork said. ``He had thrown the shotgun out.''
   Murphy also was distraught over problems at work, authorities
said.
   ``He told the agent he was hoping to get upper management's
attention,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Lance Africk. ``I'd say he
got everyone's attention.''
   During Murphy's court appearance, U.S. Magistrate Michaelle Wynne
twice read the charges against him and he responded by mumbling or
saying, ``I don't understand.'' Wynne then called for the
psychiatric evaluation at a detention center in Springfield, Mo.
   FBI spokeswoman Nancy Fisher said Murphy was not angry at his
hostage, Ms. Smith.
   ``He was upset over a family matter,'' Fisher said. ``After the
shooting started he just grabbed her.''
   But, Fisher said, ``She was definitely held against her will.''
   Volney Hayes, an FBI spokesman, said the siege started after
Murphy arrived for work Wednesday evening, pulled a birdshot-loaded
shotgun out of a bag and started shooting.
   Postal employee Leonard King, shot in the eye, was reported in
good condition at Tulane Medical Center on Thursday. One of the
other two employees was in fair condition at Tulane, a spokesman
said, but had asked that his name not be released. At Charity
Hospital, a spokeswoman said a third victim was discharged after
treatment Wednesday night.
   About 400 postal workers and customers fled the building when the
shooting broke out, authorities said. Another 100 workers took cover
and hid in the building for as long as five hours before being
escorted out by officers making a room-by-room search for the gunman.
   The gunman was cornered with his hostage at about 1 a.m. in a
windowless employee lounge with a single door. Hayes said Murphy
chased off agents with gunfire.
   Negotiations continued through the night with officers and
relatives, including a cousin who is a police officer, authorities
said.
   Hayes said Murphy made his only demand about 9 a.m., telling
negotiators he wanted to see no news reporters. In response, police
moved all reporters and photographers off the sidewalk where they
had gathered. They regrouped in a parking garage across the street.
   A few minutes later word went out that Murphy had surrendered.

   The Soviet Union announced that Col. Gen. Mikhail
A. Moiseyev will be the new military chief of staff, an appointment
that appears to signal Mikhail S. Gorbachev's desire to bring new
faces into the Red Army leadership.
   Moiseyev, 49, was appointed over several more senior officers and
is the first military leader too young to have taken part in the
Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.
   His appointment to replace Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev was
announced Thursday in the Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star.
   Akhromeyev's retirement was announced by Soviet officials in New
York Dec. 7, the day Gorbachev told the United Nations he would
unilaterally cut the Soviet military.
   That caused speculation the 65-year-old Akhromeyev was resigning
in protest. Soviet officials denied this.
   Thursday's Red Star story was the first public announcement in
the Soviet Union of Akhromeyev's retirement.
   Moiseyev's previous post was as Red Army commander in the Far
East.
   Western diplomatic sources in Moscow said little is known about
Moiseyev, who now becomes a first deputy defense minister and the
No. 2 leader under Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov.
   One source said Moiseyev was promoted to his present rank in
November 1987. ``It may suggest to some of the old-timers that it's
time to hang it up,'' said the source, who spoke on condition he not
be identified.
   Moiseyev's areas of military expertise were not known, and the
diplomatic source said it was likely that since he has been serving
in the Far East, ``the people on the general staff who will work for
him don't know him either.''
   It was not known whether Moiseyev was a protege of Yazov, but
Yazov also served as commander of the heavily fortified Far East
district before being named defense minister in May 1987.
   Yazov is known as a strong proponent of reforms in the Soviet
military in line with Gorbachev's effort to restructure Soviet
society. Akhromeyev was one of the officials Gorbachev passed over
when Yazov was named defense minister.
   Red Star said Akhromeyev was being transferred to another job. In
his announcement of Akhromeyev's retirement last week, the Foreign
Ministry spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, said he would remain an
adviser to Gorbachev.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Karpov said at a news conference
Thursday that Akhromeyev's retirement ``is in no way connected with
the Soviet troop reductions announced by Mikhail Gorbachev at the
United Nations.''
   Born into a working class family in 1939, Moiseyev joined the
Soviet army in 1958 and graduated from the Frunze Military Academy
and the military academy of the armed forces' general staff.

<HEAD>Combination Rat-Human Protein Eliminates Cancerous Cells in Two
Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doses of a hybrid rat-human protein have helped
two blood cancer patients eliminate the cancerous cells from their
bodies, according to a new report.
   Results also suggest the patients' bodies did not try to reject
the protein as foreign, a concern with rat proteins used in other
research, scientists said.
   The proteins are called monoclonal antibodies. Other research had
already shown that a different kind of monoclonal antibodies could
produce complete remissions in the blood cancer the two patients
had, called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   But the new strategy may avoid the costly and time-consuming step
of custom-designing antibodies for each patient, Wyndham Wilson of
the National Cancer Institute said Thursday.
   The new work is reported in Saturday's issue of the British
medical journal The Lancet by scientists at the University of
Cambridge and the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge,
England.
   Monoclonal antibodies seek out and bind to specific proteins on
disease-causing invaders in the bloodstream, marking the germs for
destruction by the body's immune system. Scientists are studying
ways to treat cancer by designing antibodies that will swarm onto
cancerous targets.
   One problem is that human-designed antibodies cannot yet be
generated in people. The rodent antibodies scientists use instead
can be recognized by the body as foreign, provoking an attack by the
immune system.
   In the new work, the researchers attempted to skirt that problem
by making the hybrid antibodies through genetic engineering. The
combination antibodies appeared not to provoke any immune system
attack, but it is too early to draw overall conclusions about such
antibodies, researchers wrote.
   They treated an elderly man and woman, largely as outpatients.
The antibodies were designed to seek out a protein called the
CAMPATH-1 antigen, which is found on the kind of normal cell that
turns cancerous in lymphoma.
   Following treatments earlier this year, neither patient showed
any cancerous cells in the blood or bone marrow, researchers said.
Side effects during treatment included fever and rash.
   More study is needed to see if the British technique will prove
useful in therapy, said Stanford University researcher Ronald Levy.
   Patients will have to be followed long-term to see how long the
remission lasts, said Levy, who has produced complete remissions in
the same disease with antibodies that seek proteins found on
cancerous cells.
   His treatment led to several remissions lasting longer than two
years and one lasting six years, he said Thursday.

   One young American admitted she'd forgotten what
``perestroika'' meant, and the Soviets misspelled their Christmas
cards, but that didn't spoil the enthusiasm of 68 British, U.S. and
Soviet schoolchildren at a cookies-and-carols summit.
   Despite the kinks in protocol found at any international
gathering, at the end of their hourlong ``Perestroika Christmas'' on
Thursday the children were doing what summits aim to do _ making
friends.
   The only disgruntled faces in the elegant but narrow Burlington
Arcade came from lunch-hour shoppers oblivious to the diplomacy and
irritated at the extra crowd.
   ``We came to sing a song, but mostly to meet the children, that's
the most important thing,'' said Lilly Antonov, one of four Soviet
teachers shepherding 26 charges from the Soviet Embassy school.
   ``Very many wanted to come and we had to choose those who could
sing,'' she said as her pack of 11- to 14-year-olds waited for the
late American arrivals from the American School in London.
   ``It's a bit surprising to see they're a lot like us,'' Drew
Cortese of Warren Township, N.J., said after he and 31 classmates
trundled in 10 minutes behind schedule. ``I was expecting they would
look more different.''
   The Americans wore jeans and buttons with slogans like, ``Only
Visiting This Planet.'' The Soviets, mostly girls in white blouses
and blue skirts, favored red scarves and Lenin pins. Ten British
students from Peterborough St. Margaret's High School for Girls wore
brown uniforms.
   Susan Yehle, of Finley, Ohio, said she had forgotten her
teacher's lesson on Soviet reform but was excited at ``the chance to
meet new friends.''
   Arcade organizers billed the event as an opportunity for British
and American children to introduce their Soviet peers to Christmas,
an idea not entirely new to the Soviets.
   ``We don't have any Christmas, but we have New Year's which is
just like Christmas,'' said 12-year-old Katherine Shevliecova,
explaining how rituals associated with the celebration of Jesus'
birth have been transferred to non-religious New Year's observances
at the behest of the atheist Soviet state.
   For example, popular lore has kept ``Ded Moroz,'' or Grandfather
Frost, alive as a sort of Soviet Santa and many homes have a ``New
Year's'' tree.
   The Soviet Embassy refused to get involved, said organizer Ted
Jones of the Arcade Association. But the school came through, he
said, with an offer to sing a popular children's song.
   The American and British students marched in from opposite ends
of the arcade singing Christmas carols. The Soviets, who were
waiting for them in the middle, passed out words to their anti-war
song, ``May There Always Be Sunshine,'' which they sang with
choruses in Russian and English.
   Nearby, stood a table spread with cookies, a turkey, chocolate
snowmen and oranges _ and Red Cross workers raising money for the
Armenian earthquake victims.
   The children exchanged Christmas cards _ with the Soviets'
reading ``Best Wiches for Merry Christmas and Happy New Year'' _ and
listened to grown-ups' speeches before being let loose.
   Susan produced a $10 bill for a show-and-tell, while others
exchanged addresses.

<HEAD>FBI Must Tell Why It Investigated Innocent Teen-ager, Judge Says</HEAD>

   The FBI must explain why it has kept a
classified file for six years on a high school senior who was
investigated after writing to the Soviet embassy for an encyclopedia
project, a judge says.
   ``Do all 11- or 12-year-olds have to be fearful they will have to
go through the same experience as Todd Patterson if they just write
to a foreign government?'' U.S. District Judge Alfred M. Wolin asked
Thursday.
   The agency has requested that Wolin dismiss a lawsuit brought by
the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Patterson, who as a
sixth-grader embarked on a social studies project that would teach
him far more than he bargained for about the real world.
   Six years ago, the youth wrote to foreign embassies asking for
information about their countries to compile his own encyclopedia.
   Susan Cassell, the federal attorney representing the FBI, said
the return address of Patterson's letters was that of his father's
company, Laboratory Disposable Products Inc., which probably helped
arouse the FBI's curiosity.
   According to FBI affidavits, the agency looked into the letters
because one was going to the Soviet embassy, but once they found out
they were from a boy, they dropped the probe. However, they kept a
file on him, even after he called the FBI asking for advice when he
was invited to visit the Soviet mission.
   Patterson, now 17, sued the government, asking for parts of his
file not already released under a Freedom of Information Act
request. He also sought damages for invasion of his privacy and a
halt to surveillance.
   ``In this case I'm angry,'' said the teen-ager, a senior at the
Don Bosco Preparatory School in Ramsey in the northeast corner of
New Jersey. ``I've done nothing.''
   He said it was important to carry his lawsuit forward ``because
it's going to happen again and again.''
   Ms. Cassell, however, told the judge, ``Todd Patterson is so
unbelievably unimportant to the FBI. He's a kid.''
   As soon as the FBI discovered this, they closed the case, she
said. The FBI also conducted the ``least intrusive investigative
possible,'' she said.
   Ms. Cassell said the lawsuit should be dismissed because parts of
the boy's file were exempt from disclosure for national security
reasons. Revealing the blacked out portions would disclose the
investigative methods and sources used by the bureau, according to
FBI affidavits.
   She also argued that Patterson's privacy was not violated because
only he was given information.
   Wolin heard arguments Thursday but did not rule on the request to
throw out the lawsuit.
   He asked Ms. Cassell to submit an affidavit from the FBI showing
how the agency's records on Patterson were ``pertinent to an
authorized law enforcement activity.''
   ACLU attorney Frank Askin said he would also ask that the case be
given class-action status on First Amendment grounds for other
citizens who are the subject of FBI files.
   A decision on class-action status was delayed until Wolin ruled
on the case. An opinion was likely next week, the judge's staff said.
   Patterson contends that at least 50 pieces of mail used for his
project came back damaged. That was evidence of surveillance
violating the youth's First Amendment right to ``seek information
and correspond freely,'' Askin argued.
   But Ms. Cassell said no evidence existed that the tampering was
at the FBI's hands.
   Patterson, who hopes to enter foreign diplomatic service, said
his main concern was over his future.
   He said a security clearance is needed for an internship with the
Canadian government offered by the college of his choice, the State
University of New York at Plattsburgh. The FBI file might interfere
with obtaining clearance and the internship, he said.

   A researcher who conducted a survey showing one
out of 15 teen-age boys may be using steroids warns that such use of
the muscle-building drugs may continue unless society ends an
obsession with success in athletics.
   ``You have to change the values,'' said W.E. Buckley, assistant
professor of health education at Pennsylvania State University.
``We're the ones putting all the emphasis on sports. We're the ones
putting all the emphasis on appearance.
   ``We're talking about potentially abusive behavior that has to be
addressed directly, or we may have individuals who grow up and
suffer adverse health consequences.''
   In a survey of 3,403 senior boys at 46 public and private high
schools last year, 226 boys, or 6.6 percent, of those responding
said they had used steroids, Buckley and his associates reported in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Although the research wasn't based on a random sample of the
nation's high schools, the study suggested that 250,000 to 500,000
adolescents are using or have used steroids.
   ``I didn't have any idea it would be this high,'' Buckley said,
calling his study the first of its scope in the nation.
   Androgenic anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of male
hormones that some athletes take to help build up their muscles.
   Doctors have reported in recent years that steroids have been
linked to serious side effects such as mood swings, severe acne,
baldness, temporary sterility, abnormal liver function, high blood
pressure, cardiovascular disease and possibly cancer of the liver
and testicles.
   While nearly half the boys in the study using steroids said they
did so to improve athletic performance, 26.7 percent said they used
them for the muscular appearance the drugs can help produce.
   ``It's the new-age, body beautiful, fitness people out there as
well who are using anabolic steroids,'' Buckley said Thursday.
   About 10 percent said they used steroids to treat sports-related
injuries and 7.1 percent cited social reasons, such as peer pressure.
   The study also showed that about one in five seniors claiming to
take steroids said they got the drugs from a doctor, pharmacist or
veterinarian, and 38.3 percent said they first took the drugs at age
15 or younger.
   The study called for education about steroids as early as junior
high school, noting that 35 percent of those who said they used
steroids did not participate in school sports.
   Societal attitudes must be changed to get young people to avoid
the quick-fix they think steroids can provide, Buckley said.
   He cited the example of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who won a
gold medal in the 100-meter dash at the Summer Olympics in Korea but
was forced to forfeit the award when it was determined he had used
the anabolic steroid stanazolol.
   Parents looking for steroid use should watch for unusually fast
muscle growth, mood swings, or flare-ups of acne in their children,
Buckley said.
   Virtually all studies on the long-term effects of steroids have
involved people using them legally for other ailments, so further
study of the drugs' effects, particularly on adolescents, is needed,
Buckley added.
   In an accompanying Journal editorial, Dr. Wayne V. Moore of the
University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City urged doctors to
avoid prescribing steroids to adolescents except in rare cases of
medical needs.
   Directing children into sports more suitable for their projected
adult sizes also ``might remove the temptation to enhance strength
and-or size in an adolescent who does not possess the genetic
capacity to be the biggest, strongest, and fastest,'' he wrote.

   A sharp earthquake that may have been
an aftershock to a quake two years ago jolted Southern California,
shattering windows and knocking pictures askew but causing no
serious damage or injury.
   The quake, centered about 13 miles northwest of here, struck at
9:53 p.m. Thursday and was felt in at least five Southern California
counties from Palm Springs to Los Angeles 110 miles to the west, and
San Diego 135 miles to the southeast, authorities said.
   ``It was sort of like riding a hobby horse,'' said Georgia
Duncan, a San Bernardino County sheriff's dispatcher in Victorville,
60 miles northwest of Palm Springs. ``The windows rattled and stuff
on the cabinet sort of bounced around.''
   The temblor measured 4.8 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
said Hall Daily, spokesman for Pasadena's California Institute of
Technology, which studies earthquake activity.
   ``I think it was the strongest one we had since the big one in
'86,'' said Palm Springs police Sgt. Ron Starrs, referring to a
5.6-magnitude quake that rocked Palm Springs on July 8, 1986,
causing $5.3 million in property damage.
   The latest quake, which jolted a state still suffering from the
effects of high winds, fires and snowstorms in the last week, might
have been an aftershock of the 1986 temblor, Daily said.
   ``The seismologists are looking into that possibility,'' he said.
   The quake knocked over liquor bottles and glasses at Pompeii
Nightclub here, where a few patrons headed for the door, said
manager Johnny Boreta.
   ``It was a little shaker,'' said Diana Perri, manager of Bono's,
a restaurant owned by Palm Springs' celebrity mayor, Sonny Bono.
``Mr. and Mrs. Bono did give us a call to make sure we were all OK.''
   About 15 moviegoers fled a theater at the Palm Desert Town
Center, but most of the 200 people in the audience chose to sit it
out.
   Plate glass windows bowed at the Palm Springs police station and
rims around ceiling sprinkler heads fell to the floor, but few other
problems were reported, Starrs said.
   Local hospitals reported no quake-related injuries.
   ``The most we had were some broken store windows downtown,'' said
police Lt. Mike McCabe in Palm Springs.
   In nearby Palm Desert, Mary Jo Lyon said the mirror on her
bedroom wall shook and she ran from the room to check on her
Christmas tree, which listed to one side after the jolt.
   ``It shook me up,'' she said.
   Donna Smiler, an employee of a 7-Eleven store in Palm Springs,
said the temblor was brief.
   ``I just sat here and watched everything move. All of our signs
shook. You could hear it, it was a definite rumble,'' she said.
   In Los Angeles, Chris Harris of Hollywood said his typewriter
fell off his desk, and pictures were knocked askew.
   The earthquake was the second substantial tremor this month in
Southern California.
   On Dec. 3, a 5.0-magnitude quake struck beneath downtown
Pasadena. That quake was felt in seven counties, but damage was
mostly limited to the contents of store shelves and windows.
   The most recent quake to cause extensive damage in metropolitan
Los Angeles was a 5.9-magnitude temblor that caused damage estimated
at $358 million. Eight deaths and more than 200 injuries were
attributed to that quake and its 5.3-magnitude aftershock on Oct. 4,
1987.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage and 6
severe damage.

<HEAD>Hundreds Take Advantage Of No-Visa Travel Between Japan, US</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Japanese travelers took advantage of a
new no-visa rule on flights to the United States, and an airline
spokesman said today that the first day went with hardly a hitch.
   Starting Thursday, Japan and the United States began a 21-month
pilot program that permits tourists and business visitors to enter
without visas as long as they have a return or onward ticket and
don't plan to stay for more than 90 days.
   The new system, warmly welcomed by the travel industry, is
expected to boost travel to the United States by free-spending
Japanese, as well as remove the visa routine for many Japanese.
   The only hitch reported was a Japanese couple on a Japan Air
Lines flight from Osaka to Honolulu who didn't have return tickets,
said JAL spokesman Geoffrey Tudor.
   ``Their return tickets had been bought for them in Hawaii and
were waiting in their hotel, but the immigration authorities
wouldn't let them enter until they bought new return tickets,''
Tudor said.
   ``Apart from that, we've heard of no other untoward incidents,''
he said.
   Tudor said the only figures he had heard was that 35 of 271
people aboard one JAL flight to San Francisco had taken advantage of
the visa-waiver system.
   At United Airlines, spokesman Bob Leu said about one-third of all
Japanese passengers Thursday to the United States had gone without
visas. That meant hundreds had tried the no-visa system, but Leu
would not give exact numbers for reasons of commercial secrecy.
   ``It's a pretty high number, I think, for the first day,'' Leu
said. ``It went as smoothly as can be expected on the first day.''
   The United spokesman said it also had gone ``quite easy'' for
U.S. citizens arriving in Japan without visas.
   Japanese immigration authorities said it would take several
months before they had statistical information on the number of
Americans who came without visas, but there were no reports of
problems on the first day.
   Tudor said he was worried that there could be longer delays at
U.S. entry points as immigration officials spend more time
questioning and processing Japanese who don't have visas in their
passports.
   ``Having flown 10 hours across the Pacific to visit the United
States or sunny Hawaii, how galling it is to spend three hours in an
immigration queue,'' Tudor said. ``That's not much of a welcome for
some people.''
   The United States is notorious for being more difficult for
foreign visitors to enter than most advanced countries, as
immigration officials try to make sure that a tourist doesn't intend
to become an illegal immigrant. Also, Americans don't need visas to
visit most European countries, but Europeans have to get visas at
U.S. embassies, spending time or money in the process.
   In 1986 the U.S. Congress passed a law permitting negotiations
with other countries to waive visas in some cases. Britain and the
United States started a reciprocal visa-waiver program in July, and
Japan is the second country.
   Last year 2.2 million Japanese visited the United States _ more
than any other country _ and spent an average 1,000 dollars each in
addition to the air ticket. This year the number of Japanese
visitors is projected to rise to 2.6 million.
   About 430,000 Americans visited Japan in 1987.
   The visa-waiver system applies only to tourists and businessmen
who intend short stays. Visas are still required for such visitors
for stays of 90 days or more, and for students, exchange visitors,
journalists, researchers and those who intend to marry and move to
the United States.

   The U.S. administration decided to talk with the
Palestine Liberation Organization after chairman Yasser Arafat
threatened to resign, according to a published report today.
   The Al-Qabas daily newspaper, quoting an unnamed senior Arab
official, said Arafat was going to announce his resignation at a
news conference Wednesday in Geneva only hours before President
Reagan said U.S. officials would open a dialogue with the
long-shunned PLO.
   There was no immediate independent confirmation of the report.
   Al-Qabas said Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson, who acted
as a mediator between the PLO and Washington, asked Arafat to
postpone the decision or at least refrain from announcing it until
Andersson had contacted Washington.
   The daily said Arafat postponed his news conference for several
hours until Wednesday evening while Andersson contacted U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz ``about Arafat's plan to resign.''
   The paper quoted Arafat as saying: ``If the moderate Palestinian
leadership does not suit the Americans, then let them reach
understanding with another leadership.''
   The inference appeared to be that if Arafat quit, more militant
and less flexible figures could take over.
   The paper said that following a telephone call by Andersson, the
Reagan administration advised him they would announce their decision
to open a dialogue with the PLO.
   The Americans cited Arafat's explicit recognition of Israel's
right to exist and renunciation of terrorism as the reason they
decided to talk with the PLO.

   U.S. aid to victims of the earthquake that
devastated areas of Armenia has deeply touched the Soviet
government, the Soviet ambassador to the United States says.
   ``Never before in the history of the Soviet Union have we had
international cooperation,'' Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to
the United States, said Thursday at a luncheon with religious and
business leaders assisting in relief efforts.
   ``We are deeply moved by this absolutely new element of our
relationship.''
   Relief organizers, meanwhile, announced that aid will continue to
flow to Armenia, including about $800,000 worth of machinery from
Fiat and drugs from American companies, despite indications from the
Soviet government that it was discontinuing rescue efforts.
   The U.S. government has not officially helped the Soviet Union
since the Lend-Lease program that ended after World War II. Efforts
to assist in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster were private.
   At Thursday's meeting, John M. Evans, deputy director of the
Office of Soviet Union Affairs at the State Department, said that
when news of the scope of the disaster reached President Reagan,
``there was never a single question about whether or not the
government would try to help to the best of its ability.''
   The Dec. 7 earthquake, centered in Soviet Armenia, devastated the
cities of Spitak, Leninakan and Kirovakan and killed about 55,000
people. In rural areas, the earthquake leveled 25 villages and
damaged 100 more.
   According to Evans, about 700,000 people are homeless _ a figure
Dubinin confirmed. Officials in Moscow, however, have estimated the
number of homeless at 500,000. Evans said 130,000 people were
injured.
   Evans said the U.S. government had provided more than $1.55
million in aid and private American groups had provided more than $3
million. The international community had provided nearly $37.5
million in aid, he said.
   Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the Appeal of Conscience
Foundation, which organized the working luncheon, told The
Associated Press that Italian automaker Fiat was donating 1 billion
lira, or slightly less than $800,000, in heavy duty trucks,
tractors, excavation machines and earth removal equipment to the
relief efforts.
   On Monday major U.S. drug companies will meet to determine which
company can send which supplies to the Soviet Union, he said.
   The U.S. government will not be involved in the reconstruction of
the area, which the Soviets estimate will cost $3.17 billion, Evans
said.
   Dubinin, asked about criticism that the relief efforts have been
uncoordinated and ineffectual, said: ``We have difficulties and we
have critics. We are trying to take into account every critic, from
the Armenian population, from abroad.''
   Another problem, Dubinin acknowledged, is that ``the people do
not want to leave this devastated region.''
   ``It is something human, it is something understandable, because
they have their land there, they have their buildings there, they
would like to be present, they would like to see whether there is a
chance to see somebody, loved ones, rescued. It is natural. But it
is very difficult,'' Dubinin said.

<HEAD>`Real Change' In Syphilis: More Prostitutes, Drug Users</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   While syphilis is occuring less frequently among
homosexuals, cases of the disease have sharply increased among
prostitutes and drug abusers who may be trading sex for drugs,
federal health officials say.
   Studies in Philadelphia and Connecticut have noted significant
rises in the last three years in the numbers of syphilis patients
from the latter two groups, the national Centers for Disease Control
said Thursday.
   ``The magnitude of the increase ... suggests that the trends
observed in Connecticut and Philadelphia reflect real changes,'' the
CDC said. ``The emergence of syphilis among prostitutes, drug users
and their sexual contacts may be a widespread national phenomenon.''
   ``Obviously, biologically, there's no interaction that we know of
between drug use and syphilis,'' said Dr. Jonathan Zenilman, a CDC
specialist in sexually transmitted diseases. ``Certainly, what this
looks like is that it may be a sex-for-drugs type of phenomenon.''
   For example, the CDC reported that in Connecticut, the percentage
of female syphilis patients reporting that they were prostitutes
rose from 7 percent in 1985 to 21 percent in 1987; the percentage of
females with syphilis reporting drug use rose from zero to 14
percent.
   Among heterosexual males in Philadelphia, the percentage of
syphilis patients reporting contact with prostitutes rose from 2
percent to 21 percent, while the percentage reporting drug use rose
from 5 to 13.
   As syphilis skyrockets among prostitutes and drug users, it's
dropping among homosexuals, the CDC noted. In the 1985-87 studies,
the percentage of male syphilis patients reporting that they were
homosexual or bisexual dropped sharply _ from 38 percent to 11
percent in Connecticut; from 53 percent to 18 percent in
Philadelphia.
   In the wake of AIDS, which strikes most often among homosexual
men and drug abusers, ``the gay community has had substantial
(safe-sex) education efforts,'' Zenilman said. ``The gay community
itself is one that may be more responsive to behavior modification.
   ``The drug abusing community has always been more difficult to
reach. Somebody looking for a fix is not always interested in the
long term.''
   Through last week, 37,985 civilian syphilis cases had been
reported in the United States this year, up 14 percent from the same
time a year ago and up 45 percent compared to the median for the
past five years.
   ``That's almost exclusively among heterosexual men,'' Zenilman
said, noting that the national total is increasing while the
proportion in homosexual men in decreasing.
   The CDC's report, prepared by Dr. Robert Rolfs of the
Atlanta-based agency, said that limiting the spread of syphilis may
require new tactics ``to better identify and treat syphilis-infected
prostitutes, drug users and their sexual contacts.''

<TEXT>
   Military vans equipped with loudspeakers
rumbled through the muddy streets of Spitak and urged grief-stricken
residents to leave so crews could begin demolishing the remnants of
the Armenian city.
   In nearby Leninakan, American rescue worker Caroline Hebard told
ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' today that survivors of the Dec. 7 quake were
camping out at night around fires near what had been their homes,
then searching by day for relatives in the rubble.
   Mike Tamillow, another American rescue worker in Leninakan, spoke
of the ``vastness of destruction,'' telling ``Nightline'' that
rescuers found a 60-year-old woman who had been pinned in wreckage
for five days next to her two dead children.
   The leg of one of the children was blocking her air pathway, and
rescue workers had to amputate the leg to extricate the woman,
Tamillow said.
   Relief workers in Spitak said Thursday they had given up hope of
finding more survivors in the rubble of what used to be the
third-largest city in Armenia. An estimated 15,000 of the city's
25,000 residents died in the quake, which measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale.
   The quake killed at least 55,000 people in the region and left
500,000 homeless.
   Julia Taft, an American relief official, said today the rescue
effort was nearly over. Voices and other signs of life had dropped
sharply since Monday, when temperatures fell below freezing, she
said.
   The official Tass news agency said Thursday only one person had
been found alive in Armenia the past 24 hours.
   ``Along with rescue operations ... stern measures on providing
sanitary order in populated areas of regions of the disaster are of
primary importance now, '' the newspaper Socialist Industry said
today.
   The newspaper said of Spitak, ``There is a very acute problem of
water supplies in the town. There is a shortage of portable toilets
and the removal of debris.''
   Nouradian Norig Kritkorianizh, first secretary of Spitak's
Communist Party, said crews would begin razing the city Sunday after
an evacuation expected to take three days. Rebuilding of the city
will begin in early spring, he said without elaborating.
   Trucks distributed milk, bread, sausages, meat and oranges to
survivors in the cold, damp city.
   Some people set up what was left of their household belongings _
upholstered chairs, mattresses and even an occassional brass bed _
around bonfires where it was warmer than inside donated tents.
   People pressed against the gates of what was once Spitak's
central market, where soldiers distributed coats.
   ``Yesterday (Wednesday), Health Minister Yevgenvy Chazov said the
search was to continue but that with the lapse of time hopes grow
smaller and smaller. They are still looking for people in the
ruins,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said at a
Moscow news briefing.
   Ms. Taft, director of the U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance
office, told ``Nightline,'' ``It's very important that we understand
that we are through practically with the search and rescue stage.''
   Ms. Taft, speaking from Frankfurt, West Germany, urged people to
send money to the Red Cross or the Armenian Relief Agency but to
hold off on traveling to Armenia or sending more supplies because of
the congestion there.
   ``There is a shroud of death,'' she said somberly. ``There are
three victims ... the people who lost their lives, the people who
lived but lost their families and their hope, and the relief workers
who feel they should do more.''
   Teams from France and Britain began heading home Thursday.
   Willie McMartin, head of the 14-member International Rescue Corps
from Britain, said he doubted anybody was still alive. ``If I
thought there was someone still alive I would not be sitting here,''
McMartin told reporters at London's Heathrow airport.
   McMartin said his group was physically exhausted and that the
Soviets were beginning to employ bulldozers, making it difficult for
them to use their high technology equipment to find victims.
   George Reid, spokesman for the League of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies, said 25,000 bodies had been counted based on
figures provided to the Red Cross by the Soviet Council of Ministers.
   Thousands of corpses remained buried in rubble.
   In Yerevan, Armenia's capital, psychologists began treating the
scores of children left orphans by the quake.
   Many survivors are having nightmares, and the Soviet Children's
Fund, a charity, sent 11 child psychologists to Armenia to help.
   ``Who has trouble sleeping?'' psychologist Valeria Mukhina asked
a group of children, whose parents are dead or missing.
   Nearly all at the session raised their hands and yelled, ``I do,
I do!''

<TEXT>
   Two pilots who made an emergency landing on
a remote glacier in their restored World War II-era plane were
stranded for a third night after snow again thwarted efforts to
rescue them.
   ``They seem to be in good spirits and holding up well,'' Coast
Guard Cmdr. Bruce Merchant said late Thursday. ``They're inside the
aircraft so they're relatively warm and safe.''
   The Coast Guard, which has been in radio contact with the men,
planned to try again to lift them off Grand Pacific Glacier in
British Columbia with a helicopter today if the weather cleared,
officials said.
   The men, who were unhurt, have survival gear and food in the
Grumman Widgeon amphibious plane, which was undamaged in the landing.
   Pilot Michael Mills, 38, and passenger Charles ``Buddy''
Ferguson, 31, of Gustavus have enough supplies for three or four
days, Coast Guard Lt. Rick Ehret said.
   The Coast Guard H-3 helicopter was able to land Thursday at the
foot of the glacier at Tarr Inlet, but the weather never cleared.
The chopper reached an elevation of only 1,500 feet above sea level,
and the stranded men are several miles inland at the 3,400-foot
level, Merchant said. The helicopter returned to Sitka along the
southeast coast of Alaska.
   The huge glacier is 45 miles north of the small southeast Alaska
port town of Gustavus, and stretches across the international
border. The pilots are on the Canadian side, said Marvin Jensen,
superintendent of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.
   ``A land recovery seems out of the question,'' Ehret said.
``They're going to have to wait for us to fly in there.''
   Jensen said it might be possible to get a boat near the foot of
the glacier and hike in, he said it would take at least two days to
get the men out. The pair are four to five miles from Tarr Inlet,
said Coast Guard Lt. Andrew Berghorn.
   The men were flying from Cordova to Gustavus when they made their
emergency landing for unknown reasons, Ehret said.
   A pilot in Gustavus who declined to give his name said the plane
may have been running out of fuel or hit a snow squall in the
mountain pass above the glacier. The plane had been reassembled and
restored in Anchorage during the past four months and was certified
for flight, he said.
   Mills' wife, Connie, said the men had recently restored the plane.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, seeking to
counter the new U.S.-PLO dialogue, plans to launch a new peace
initiative once a coalition government has been formed, a top aide
said today.
   ``Mr. Shamir is considering new moves after he forms the
government,'' said Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner. ``He is seriously
considering options on how to act in the diplomatic field.''
   Pazner would not elaborate, but he denied a report in the Haaretz
daily newspaper that Shamir considered granting autonomy to the 1.7
million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Mr. Shamir believes that unilateral moves have no value,''
Pazner told The Associated Press. ``He believes only an agreement
resulting from negotiations is viable.''
   Haaretz quoted officials close to Shamir as saying the prime
minister, who heads the right-wing Likud bloc, wanted to form a
coalition with the left-leaning Labor Party as quickly as possible
and then launch a peace initiative focusing on autonomy.
   The newspaper also said Shamir was deeply hurt by President
Reagan's decision Wednesday to open talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which Israel considers a terrorist
organization.
   In a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering on Thursday,
Shamir said the U.S. decision was a ``terrible mistake,'' and he
criticized Washington for not informing Israel about it sooner,
Haaretz said.
   ``This behavior is unacceptable between two allies,'' Haaretz
quoted Shamir as telling Pickering.
   Washington's announcement that it would meet with the PLO came
after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and said he
recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Pazner predicted the talks would fail.
   ``We believe that the United States will discover very soon the
true face of the PLO and will realize that it can not be a partner
for negotiations and peace,'' he said.
   Israel wants to see the U.S. initiative fail quickly, or it will
face mounting international pressure for a favorable response to the
PLO, analysts said.
   A delay in the response could endanger relations with Washington,
Israel's main ally and the source of $3 billion in annual aid.
   But Ariel Merari of the Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies predicted U.S.-PLO contacts would last for
``months or even a year without any dramatic developments'' as they
focus on questions of procedure.
   An agreement on a U.N.-sponsored peace conference would be the
likely outcome of successful U.S.-PLO talks. Many Israelis view it
as a forum for demanding far-reaching land concessions from the
Jewish state.
   But the first item on the agenda of U.S.-PLO contacts will be the
question of terrorism, Secretary of State George P. Shultz told
Israeli reporters in Washington.
   ``The first point we will make in that dialogue is to emphasize
our total rejection of terrorism anywhere, outside Israel, inside
Israel,'' Shultz said in remarks broadcast on Israel television.
   Merari, an expert on terrorism, said Arafat may order his Fatah
faction to refrain from terror attacks abroad or attempts to
infiltrate Israel on hostage-taking missions. But he said terror
linked to the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories will
continue.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians called the U.S.
move a victory of their yearlong revolt, which has left at least 326
Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead.
   Dozens of Jewish settlers from the territories began a hunger
strike and pitched tents in front of Shamir's office.
   ``The U.S. policy of recognizing the PLO is the seed of the next
war,'' said Ron Nachman, a settler leader. ``Israel cannot reach
agreement with the PLO. There's no common ground and the result will
be an explosion.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, a political rival of Shamir, said
the Jewish state had to come up ``with a new political initiative as
an answer to this situation.''
   Peres proposed elections in the occupied territories to choose
Palestinian leaders for peace negotiations, saying Israel ``will not
negotiate with an armed delegation instead of an elected one.''
   Within Peres' left-leaning Labor party, a group of 30 doves
called on the leadership to change the party platform and allow
contacts with the PLO.
   Ezer Weizman, a Labor Cabinet minister without portfolio, said
Arafat's statements made the PLO a satisfactory partner.
   ``I think a new era has opened,'' he said. ``Now our political
platform must be reconsidered.''

<HEAD>Study Planned Of Rising AIDS Risk Among Heterosexuals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Doctors hope a major new study of AIDS cases
among drug-free heterosexuals will help them prevent a huge new
epidemic of the disease stemming from that usually low-risk group.
   ``One of the key problems in the AIDS epidemic is that people
don't know they're at risk,'' said Dr. Stanley H. Weiss, a
researchers at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey.
   ``That's particularly a problem among heterosexuals, some of whom
have no idea their partners are placing them at risk,'' said Weiss,
who is heading the project.
   The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said
the $22.8 million, five-year study is being conducted on 2,000
heterosexuals in Paterson, Newark and Jersey City, N.J., and
Brooklyn, N.Y.
   ``Unfortunately, we see women and children as the newest wave of
victims,'' said Dr. James Oleske, one of the nation's leading AIDS
researchers. ``The spread to women and children is a trend that is
probably going to continue into the next decade.''
   Oleske, also a UMDNJ researcher who will serve on the study team,
said scientists hope to learn enough to stem a mammoth, new AIDS
epidemic. The first wave of AIDS cases primarily affected homosexual
and bisexual men and intravenous drug users.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the institute's director, said the four
Northeast areas were selected for the study because of their high
concentration of HIV-infected drug users, a potential source of HIV
infection in heterosexuals.
   HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system, rendering the victim incapable of resisting other diseases
and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact
with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. It can
also pass from an infected mother to an infant during pregnancy or
birth.
   As of Dec. 12, AIDS had been diagnosed in 80,538 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 45,164, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to federal statistics. No one is known to have recovered
from AIDS.
   In New Jersey, 65 percent of AIDS cases involve heterosexuals,
but nationally about 70 percent involve homosexual and bisexual men,
Weiss said.
   About 8 percent of the heterosexual cases in New Jersey have no
apparent risk factor for the AIDS virus other than heterosexual
activity, while about 4 percent cases nationally can be traced to
heterosexual contact, he added.
   Heterosexual conduct accounts for 30 percent of all AIDS cases
among women, according to the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.
   Similar studies of heterosexuals have been conducted elsewhere,
but their samples have been too small to draw conclusions, Weiss
said.
   ``The sexual transmission and progression of AIDS among
heterosexuals is virtually unexplored territory,'' Weiss said. ``In
effect, we will be helping to write the book on this subject.''
   John French, an epidemiologist with the New Jersey Department of
Health, said the state has been an early indicator of the spread of
AIDS through urban areas, with positive results for about 11 percent
of the people tested at three centers in the state. Other urban
areas in the country can expect similar results in the next decade,
he said.

<TEXT>
   A stubborn storm lingered off the southern coast of California
today, pelting the area with rain, up to 6 inches of wet snow and
stiff winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
   Snow fell on much of San Luis Obispo County, bringing highway
traffic to a near standstill. Six inches of snow fell at Santa
Margarita and Cuesta Ridge; 1 to 4 inches blanketed Paso Robles
City; and 4 inches of snow hit Atascadero.
   The storm remaining off California's southern coast brought the
strong winds and rain, with the rain changing to snow in higher
elevations. The storm was not expected to move much today.
   Heavier rainfall by early this morning included almost 2 inches
at Mount Wilson, Calif.
   The storm was to produce as much as 2 feet of snow in the higher
elevations by Sunday morning and winds gusting as high as 60 mph.
   In the East, a snow squall warning was posted early today over
north, central New York and along the eastern shores of Lake
Ontario, where up to 6 inches of snow was forecast to fall this
morning.
   Wind chills remained in the bitter cold range over northern New
York. By midnight, Massina reached 3 degrees above zero and the 15
to 20 mph winds brought a wind chill of 30 below zero.
   By midnight snowfall extended from western New York across
northwest Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Dakota and southeast
Colorado. Also, rain reached from the Florida panhandle across
southern Alabama and central Georgia into central South Carolina.
   Today's forecast called for snow from eastern North Dakota across
Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and upper Michigan, as well as through
the southern Rockies; and rain from central California across
southwest California, becoming snow in the mountains of Southern
California.
   High temperatures were forecast in the single digits and the
teens from northern New England across the Great Lakes, Minnesota
and eastern North Dakota; in the 20s and 30s from central New
England through North Carolina, over the Ohio and Tennessee valleys,
from Iowa across Arkansas, the rest of the northern half of the
Plains, the Rockies and the northern half of the Plateau; in the 40s
and 50s from South Carolina across northern Florida, from the
central Gulf of Mexico states across Louisiana and New Mexico; in
the 50s over much of California and the 60s over the inland
Southwest and in the 70s over southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees below zero at Wausau, Wis., to 82 degrees at Homestead, Fla.

   Bess Myerson's lawyer, saying prosecutors were
driven by desperation in their attempts to convict the former Miss
America of conspiracy, told jurors in his summation, ``You will
never see anything as low.''
   Attorney Frederick Hafetz on Thursday said the case against Miss
Myerson, who is accused of trying to influence a judge, was based
primarily on circumstantial evidence and lambasted the government
for its use of an unreliable star witness.
   He noted that Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Abrams, in his
summation, made much of the fact that during the spring and summer
of 1983, Miss Myerson was calling the judge on her private line
while using an assumed name.
   ``You only do something like that when you know you're doing
something wrong,'' Abrams told the jury earlier this week.
   Hafetz conceded that evidence about the mysterious phone calls
``sounds suspicious'' and ``sexy.'' But, he countered, ``there is
not one whit of evidence the government needs to sustain a criminal
conspiracy.''
   Meantime, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan, who plans to give
the 11-week-old case to jurors on Monday, ordered an early start for
today's session and said lawyers for both sides would have only
until day's end to finish arguing their case.
   He said it would be unfair for government lawyers to have all
weekend to work on a rebuttal.
   Miss Myerson, Miss America 1945 and once New York City's cultural
affairs commissioner, is accused of trying to influence a judge's
rulings in the divorce of her lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, by
giving a city job to the judge's daughter, Sukhreet Gabel.
   Miss Myerson, Capasso and the former judge are all on trial.
   According to prosecutors, former state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel slashed Capasso's weekly support payments to his
estranged wife after Miss Myerson gave the $19,000-a-year job to
Sukhreet Gabel in August 1983.
   Hafetz likened the gossipy testimony of many prosecution
witnesses to a soap opera, saying ``it has been rich in gossip, it
has been rich in rumor, it has been rich in innuendo but the only
thing it hasn't been rich in is hard evidence.''
   But his harshest criticism was reserved for the use of Ms. Gabel
as a witness against her mother.
   Ms. Gabel, 39, said she took shopping bags full of documents from
her mother's home to prosecutors and twice tape-recorded phone
conversations with her mother for the government.
   ``Shame on them!'' Hafetz said of the prosecution. ``It's a low,
an all-time low. You can sit in an American courtroom for the rest
of your life and you will never see anything as low.''
   Hafetz, who got Ms. Gabel to admit on cross-examination that
electroshock treatments for clinical depression had left her memory
like ``Swiss cheese,'' asked the jury: ``Are they so desperate? Do
they want to win the case that badly that they will stoop into the
gutter with such indecent behavior.''
   Miss Myerson, 64; Capasso, 43, and Mrs. Gabel, 75, who made
interim rulings in Capasso's bitter divorce, are all charged with
conspiracy, fraud and bribe-related charges.
   Miss Myerson is also charged with obstruction of justice. She
faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison if convicted of all
charges.
   Her two co-defendants face up to 25 years in prison, if convicted.

<HEAD>Remains Found In Joint Excavation Of U.S. Warplane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Laotian team found one set of
human remains during a joint excavation of an American warplane
crash site that ended today, a U.S. spokesman said.
   The seven-day excavation was aimed at resolving the fate of the
pilot of a reconnaissance aircraft shot down in March 1968 over
Sepone, in Laos' southern Savannakhet province, said Lt. Col. Thomas
J. Boyd, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command.
   He said much of the plane wreckage remained at the site, a
sparsely populated, overgrown jungle.
   ``Remains were found at the site and have been flown to Bangkok
today,'' Boyd said. ``They will then be flown to the Army Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii for evaluation.''
   He said the 16-member U.S. military team received good
cooperation from the Laotian government and local residents, and the
United States hoped for more such efforts to account for the 547
Americans missing in action in Laos. The team worked with 20 Laotian
workers.
   Many of the Americans missing in Laos were airmen on missions to
interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a route in Laos which Communist
North Vietnam used to send men and supplies to U.S.-backed South
Vietnam during the Vietnam War.
   It was the fourth joint excavation in Laos. Boyd said the
American team also looked at other crash sites that may be jointly
excavated in the future.
   Most team members were from the Army laboratory and the U.S.
Joint Casualty Resolution Center, also based in Honolulu. They
stayed in pitched tents and lived military-style during the project.
   In total, 1,747 Americans are listed as missing in action from
the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>President Dissolves Parliament, Orders New Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT VILA, Vanuatu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President George Sokomanu dissolved
parliament today and ordered national elections in February for the
politically troubled South Pacific country.
   His announcement follows months of political turmoil in this
former Anglo-French territory, once called the New Hebrides.
   Sokomanu, citing economic problems and reports of violence, took
the action after Prime Minister Walter Lini's government handily won
by-elections this week.
   Longtime rival Barak Sope, who challenged Lini's leadership by
boycotting the polls, led a demonstration today outside the
parliament in defiance of a government ban against such gatherings.
   Roads leading to the capital were blocked and cars were searched
for weapons, while police in riot-gear manned barricades around
Parliament House. Most of central Vila was boarded up in
anticipation of violence.
   Local radio meanwhile said an Australian tourist was recovering
after being shot in the shoulder late Thursday by a member of the
paramilitary Vanuatu Mobile Force.
   The teen-ager, Michael Hendersen, was shot when he drove through
a checkpoint without stopping, news reports said.
   An Australian Embassy spokesman said Henderson was in a local
hospital recovering from surgery.
   The Australian Associated Press said Sokomanu dissolved
parliament during a 30-minute speech in Vanuatu's Bislama language.
   Sokomanu blamed Vanuatu's economic problems on the current
political turmoil.
   This week's ballot, which was boycotted by the main opposition
parties, gave Lini control of two-thirds of the 46-seat parliament.

<HEAD>Bond Set For Bakker, Former PTL Associates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker proclaimed his
innocence after a federal magistrate set a $50,000 bond for him and
three former aides accused of bilking $4 million from his TV
ministry's flock.
   ``Basically, to be very, very honest, it's a sad day for me,''
Bakker said after Thursday's hearing. ``Here at Christmastime, it's
sad for my family, my children and my friends. But we have a good
God and I have wonderful attorneys standing by my side.''
   Bakker, 48, arrived at the federal courthouse in a white
Cadillac, smiling and waving to reporters.
   After the 30-minute hearing, he said, ``I am not guilty of these
charges and I'm looking forward to due process taking place. If I
get a fair trial, we can win this case.''
   His wife, Tammy, did not accompany him.
   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor continued an arraignment for Bakker
and co-defendant Richard Dortch until Jan. 17, when both men will
enter pleas and a trial date will be set.
   Taylor set bonds of $50,000 apiece for Bakker, Dortch and
brothers James and David Taggart.
   Taylor ordered Bakker to remain in South Carolina and the court's
western North Carolina district. Dortch was restricted to North
Carolina and Florida, where he lives.
   Bakker did get some good news. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry
Miller said no additional charges were planned against Bakker and
Dortch.
   Bakker, Dortch, and the Taggarts were indicted Dec. 5 after a
16-month federal grand jury investigation into PTL's operations
under Bakker's leadership.
   Dortch is Bakker's former top deputy. David Taggart is Bakker's
former personal aide, and James Taggart is PTL's former interior
decorator.
   Bakker and Dortch are charged with mail fraud and wire fraud.
They also are accused of conspiring to defraud ministry contributors
to support extravagant lifestyles and of diverting more than $4
million in PTL money for their personal benefit.
   Bakker's only comments in court were to respond ``yes, sir'' when
Taylor asked if he understood the charges.
   The Taggarts pleaded innocent to charges of tax evasion and
conspiring to impede the IRS in tax collection. They are accused of
using more than $1.1 million in PTL money for personal expenditures.
   Taylor tentatively scheduled the Taggarts' trial for the last
week of January. The Taggarts' attorney, Ben Cotten, said he
expected to request a continuance, and Taylor said it likely would
be granted.
   George T. Davis, Bakker's chief counsel, said the case had
broader implications.
   ``Bakker is not the only one on trial,'' Davis said after the
hearing. ``His wife is on trial and the whole ministry _ the
electronic ministry _ is on trial. ''
   At a news conference, Dortch indicated he might seek a separate
trial.
   ``Probably the question we're asked most repeatedly is: `Am I
trying to separate myself from Jim and Tammy Bakker?''' he said. ``I
must stand on my own statements, not those of others, on my
intentions, not the intentions of others.''
   The Taggart brothers declined to comment.
   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 in a sex-and-hush
money scandal involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn. Three
months later, PTL filed for bankruptcy protection.
   On Tuesday, Toronto real estate magnate Stephen Mernick bought
the assets of PTL for $65 million at a hearing before U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds in Columbia, S.C.

   A 9-year-old girl would like to find a
man who acted like Santa Claus but looked ``like Superman'' so she
could thank him for making a Christmas wish come true.
   Judy Darr was shopping with her parents last Sunday at Zale's at
Valley View Mall in Dallas when a crystal teddy bear caught her eye.
It cost $30.
   The girl told her father if she saved $7 more, she'd have enough
for the bear. The family continued shopping, and a few minutes later
``a gentleman came up and dropped a box in front of me,'' Judy wrote
in a letter to the Dallas Times Herald.
   ``He tapped me on the shoulder and said, `Merry Christmas.' We
looked up, and he was gone. We opened the box, and there was a
beautiful crystal teddy bear,'' she wrote.
   ``We were startled and looked around for him. We could not find
him. Now I have the teddy bear on my TV stand. Every time I look at
it or think of it, I wish I could thank him. I hope he will read
this and know I wish him a Merry Christmas.''
   Patricia Bohn, the girl's mother, said her daughter described the
man as looking ``like Superman before he was Superman, which I guess
means like Clark Kent.''
   The third-grader ``is obsessed with trying to thank this man,''
her mother said.
   Mrs. Bohn said this stranger has brought the meaning of Christmas
home to her family.
   ``It's experiences like this that renew our faith in people, that
they are good and kind,'' Mrs. Bohn said. ``This man made a little
girl very happy, and she wants to grow up and be just like that. I
wish we could thank him.''

   Chisholm High School officials don't know who
to blame: the publisher, the postal service or school officials, but
yearbooks for the class of 1986 arrived a little late.
   The school received them Tuesday.
   Some of the students who ordered and paid $20 for the yearbooks
are now juniors in college, said school Superintendent Alan
Livingston.
   ``It's been a fiasco,'' Livingston said.
   School officials mailed material for the yearbook to Taylor
Publishing Co., of Dallas, four separate times, Livingston said.
Some material sent by certified mail was received. Other material,
sent uncertified, was not and had to be redone.
   ``Everytime we'd get a notice the material didn't make it, I'd
get out my Kleenex box and cry a little,'' Livingston said.
   Each time the yearbook material was lost, publishing company
executives searched their warehouses but never found it.
   ``Was the U.S. mail service that poor, to lose it four times? I
don't think so,'' Livingston said.
   That leaves Taylor Publishing. Livingston is willing to let them
off the hook too.
   ``Do I think we dropped the ball and messed up? That I don't
know,'' Livingston said.

<HEAD>Judge Says Young Killer Got Light Sentence Because Victims Were
Homosexuals</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents, particularly of grafs 3 and 9.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge says he sentenced an 18-year-old killer to
30 years in prison instead of the maximum life term partly because
the two men he shot to death were homosexuals.
   ``These two guys that got killed wouldn't have been killed if
they hadn't been cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,''
District Judge Jack Hampton told the Dallas Times Herald in an
interview published today.
   ``I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up
teen-age boys,'' Hampton said Thursday. ``I've got a teen-age boy.''
   Richard Lee Bednarski, a Richland College student at the time of
his conviction Nov. 19, was found guilty of murder in the May 15
slayings of Tommy Lee Trimble, 34, and Lloyd Griffin, 27.
   Hampton said he rejected a prosecution request to sentence
Bednarski to life imprisonment because, in his opinion, Bednarski's
victims were not entirely blameless.
   The sentence would have been much stiffer, Hampton said, had the
victims been ``a couple of housewives out shopping, not hurting
anybody.''
   ``These homosexuals, by running around on weekends picking up
teen-age boys, they're asking for trouble,'' Hampton said. ``They
really are.''
   The judge's statements provoked outrage from Dallas Gay Alliance
President William Waybourn and surprise from Griffin's father, Don.
   ``The judge is saying that queers are not worthy of legal
protections and you can go out and shoot them any time,'' Waybourn
said Thursday. ``Unfortunately, Dallas County will reward him with
re-election.
   ``God help any other victim that gets into his court that was
also at the wrong place at the wrong time.''
   ``I thought Hampton was a fairer man than that,'' said Don
Griffin, a city councilman in the West Texas town of Sterling City.
``I always thought that a human life was a human life no matter
what.''
   Robert Flowers, executive director of the state Commission on
Judicial Conduct, said Hampton's reasoning in deciding on
Bednarski's sentence probably fell within the bounds of reasonable
judicial discretion.
   ``I can't right off think of any part of the code that might
violate,'' Flowers said. ``It is his discretion.''
   Testimony in Bednarski's trial indicated that he and a group of
North Mesquite High School students drove to Dallas' Oak Lawn area
to harass homosexuals the night of May 15.
   Testimony indicated that Bednarski persuaded another youth to
join him in a plan to rob Trimble and Griffin, who had invited the
boys into their car. The four drove to Reverchon Park and walked to
a hilltop clearing.
   The other youth testified that Bednarski immediately pulled a
pistol and ordered the men to take off their clothes.
   When they refused, he said, Bednarski began shooting. Trimble
died immediately of wounds in the face, neck and back. Griffin, who
was also shot three times, died five days later at Parkland Memorial
Hospital.
   Witnesses said Bednarski bragged that he stuck the gun in
Trimble's mouth before shooting him.
   Defense lawyer Kevin Clancy asked a jury to decide Bednarski's
guilt, but asked that Hampton set the punishment because he believed
the judge would be more sympathetic. Clancy asked for the minimum
sentence of five years.
   Prosecutor David Pickett argued that the killings warranted a
life sentence.
   ``In my opinion, a human being is a human being and the execution
slaying of a human being deserves the maximum punishment,'' Pickett
told the jury.
   The judge said Thursday that in sentencing Bednarski he took into
account the defendant's lack of a criminal record, his attendance of
college classes and his being raised in a good home by a father who
is a police officer in nearby Euless.
   Hampton expressed no reservations about expressing his views.
   ``Just spell my name right,'' he said. ``If it makes anybody mad,
they'll forget it by 1990,'' when he is up for re-election.

   Despite a plea by soul singer James Brown that
he'd do anything to avoid prison and continue performing, a judge
sentenced him to six years for failing to stop for police and trying
to run over two officers in a two-state car chase.
   Circuit Judge Hubert Long sentenced Brown on Thursday after an
Aiken County jury convicted the 55-year-old ``Godfather of Soul'' of
one count of failing to stop for police and two counts of aggravated
assault in the Sept. 24 chase.
   The jury acquitted Brown of two counts of assault with intent to
kill.
   Long sentenced Brown to six years for failing to stop, and gave
him a choice on the assault convictions: pay a $6,000 fine and spend
five years on probation or do six months in prison. Brown won't have
to decide until after he serves the six-year term, said the
prosecutor, Solicitor Robert Harte.
   Brown, who could have drawn a 20-year term, will be eligible for
parole after serving 1{ years. He could win earlier eligibility for
good behavior or prison work, Harte said.
   ``He's going to serve some time,'' Harte said. ``I can't say how
much, but it's going to be a substantial amount.''
   ``Mr. Brown is resigned to the fate the jury has handed him.
There's no point in arguing any further,'' defense lawyer Bill Weeks
said.
   Brown's attorneys, however, were expected to return to court
today to file appeal motions.
   The jury deliberated for more than three hours before convicting
the Grammy Award-winner, who lives in Beech Island about five miles
southeast of Augusta, Ga.
   Afterward, Brown, holding a small Bible, told Long about his
delinquency as a juvenile and the difficulties he faced early in
life.
   ``The only thing that held me together was when I looked at the
(U.S.) flag, and that represented a chance,'' he said.
   ``I respect police, without them we have nothing. Any law is
better than no law. (America) ... that's the only thing I've got to
believe in _ the greatest flag in the world.
   ``James Brown the man wants to do right. I've wanted to do right
all my life,'' Brown said. ``I'll do anything I can not to go to
prison, so I can continue my work.''
   Long said after sentencing that he was not being hard on Brown
because of his celebrity status.
   ``For those who disregard the law, punishment is a certainty,''
the judge said. ``For those who say `Give him another chance,' this
is not the first time. I've got to consider the whole history.''
   Harte noted that Brown was convicted last February of assault and
battery involving an officer and that in July the singer was found
guilty of illegally carrying a pistol and pleaded no contest to
carrying the drug PCP.
   Long said he was impressed by what Brown and the singer's friends
had said about the performer's efforts to fight drug abuse and
promote education.
   He ordered Brown to undergo examination and treatment for any
drug or alcohol problem he might have.
   The chase through Augusta, Ga., and North Augusta began after
Brown, wielding a shotgun, interrupted an insurance seminar in a
building where he has an office.
   The pursuit involved 10 to 14 vehicles and hit speeds of 60-85
mph, Officer Ronnie Delaughter testified.
   At one point, Brown sped away after stopping and several officers
shot out the tires on his pickup truck, Delaughter said. Brown also
tried to run over two North Augusta officers.
   Brown, who pleaded innocent to the charges, said Wednesday he
didn't stop for police because he feared for his life.
   ``I was scared to death,'' he said. ``I went to Vietnam and I
wasn't that frightened,''
   His many hits include ``Please, Please, Please,'' ``Night
Train,'' ``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,'' ``I Got You (I Feel
Good),'' ``Say It Loud _ I'm Black and I'm Proud,'' and ``Get Up I
Feel Like Being a Sex Machine.''

<TEXT>
   Bloodstains on a pillowcase and exercise bar
found in Joel Steinberg's apartment came from his former lover, an
FBI expert testified at Steinberg's trial on charges he beat his
illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter to death.
   Hedda Nussbaum, who lived with Steinberg for 12 years, has
testified that Steinberg beat her on the head and legs with the bar.
   FBI serologist Robert J. Grispino testified Thursday that was
``100 percent'' certain the bloodstains were not from Steinberg,
Steinberg's daughter, Lisa; or Steinberg's illegally adopted son,
Mitchell, who has since been returned to his natural mother.
   Grispino's testimony came Thursday afternoon after the morning
session was canceled because judge Harold Rothwax suffered two
broken wrists when he was hit by a car as he rode his bicycle to
work.
   Rothwax's wrists were put in casts. When the 58-year-old judge
returned to the courtroom, he followed doctors' orders to keep his
arms elevated by sitting with his elbows on the desk and hands in
front of his face.
   As the session proceeded, his clerk had to put his glasses on for
him and turn pages for him.
   ``I regret being delayed today,'' he told jurors at the end of
the day. ``I'm going to try to come down (to court) safely tomorrow.
You try to come down safely, too.''
   Lisa's death last year in an affluent, well-educated household
shocked many New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of the duty and
ability of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and
report evidence of child abuse.

   A commuter airplane crashed today in a
remote gold-mining region of western Australia, killing all 10
people aboard, officials said.
   The twin-engine plane exploded in a ball of flames, local
residents said, scattering wreckage across a wide area. The crash
occurred in the desert near the gold-mining town of Leonara,
authorities said.
   Civil Aviation Authority spokesman Doug Holden said the plane
spiralled to the ground near an Outback ranch from an altitude of
about 5,000 feet.
   The turboprop, chartered by a mining company, was en route to
Kalgoolie, site of the Australian gold rush of the late 1800s.
   It was the worst air accident in Australia since 1983, when 12
people were killed in the crash of another mining company plane in
Queensland.
   The Australian Associated Press said the plane was believed to be
transporting directors and staff of the Perth-based Independent
Resources Ltd., a mining company.
   Police said the victims included the pilot, six women and three
men.
   Air safety investigators were sifting through the wreckage to
determine the cause of the crash.

   The Supreme Court today directed the

death for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   A five-judge panel headed by Chief Justice R.S. Pathak ordered
the execution of the Sikh, Kehar Singh, be held in abeyance in the
meantime.
   Lawyers said the stay also applies automatically to the execution
of Satwant Singh, the other Sikh sentenced to death in the case.
   A trial court convicted the two in 1986 and sentenced them to
hang. The convictions and the sentences were upheld by the Delhi
High Court later that year and by the Supreme Court in August.
   Kehar Singh, convicted of conspiracy in the case, appealed to
President Ramaswamy Venkataraman for mercy, the only recourse left
to a prisoner condemned to death by the Supreme Court. The president
dismissed the appeal last month and said in a letter he could not
consider the merits of a case already decided by the highest court
in the land.
   The rejection of the appeal was challenged by Kehar Singh's
lawyers, who claimed Venkataraman had powers to reconsider the
facts. The challenge came 15 hours before the two Sikhs were
scheduled to be hanged at New Delhi's Tihar Jail on Dec. 2. The
death sentences have been stayed since then.
   The judges ruled the president has the power to go into the
merits of the case, despite the Supreme Court's rulings.
   ``They've done justice. It's a great judgment,'' said Rajender
Singh, Kehar Singh's son, who was in court for the verdict of the
five-judge panel.
   R.S. Sodhi, the lawyer for Satwant Singh, said the stay on the
execution applied also to his client.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot in the garden of her New Delhi residence on
Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards. One of them, Beant
Singh, was killed in a shootout with other bodyguards minutes later.
   The other assassin, Satwant Singh, was arrested and charged after
he recovered from gunshot wounds received in the shootout.
   Kehar Singh, a maternal uncle of Beant Singh, was arrested later
and charged with conspiracy.
   All Sikhs take the name Singh, which means lion in the Punjabi
language, by doctrine of their faith.
   Mrs. Gandh's assassination was in revenge for an army raid she
had ordered four months earlier on the Golden Temple, Sikhism's
holiest shrine.
   The shrine in Amritsar had been taken over by armed Sikh
militants agitating for an independent homeland in the northern
state of Punjab. About 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died in the
army raid.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are a
majority in Punjab. Sikh militants have been fighting for a separate
state since 1982, claiming discrimination by the Hindu community,
which makes up 80 percent of the country's population.

   The time has come for those strangely ironic
symptoms that seem inappropriate to the season, but the Rev. Lee
Fullerton offers some reassurance: Those ``holiday blues'' are
really quite common.
   As noted in pastoral and psychiatric counselling, the melancholy
oddly descends most widely in the presumably happiest periods,
especially the weeks from Thanksgiving to Christmas.
   ``It's when you're supposed to feel good and be happy,'' said
Fullerton, an Atlanta pastor who has worked extensively in the
mental health field. ``But a lot of people don't feel that way.''
   There's a simple system for helping ward off that despondency, he
said _ talking about it with relatives, friends or fellow church
members, or getting them to open up about it.
   ``You can't just pull people out of it,'' he said. ``But it can
help to encourage them to talk about it, to let them know that most
people have such feelings once in a while.''
   A costless Christmas present to others, he suggested in a
telephone interview, might be: ``Pay a little more attention to
people.''
   Fullerton, 39, pastor of Atlanta's Steward Avenue United
Methodist Church and formerly a pastoral counselor at the Georgia
Mental Health Institute, has written some pre-Christmas advice on
the subject for fellow clergy.
   It was distributed by the urban mission arm of the denomination's
North Georgia conference.
   Fullerton cited two main factors that bring on the slump in mood:
The holiday reality often doesn't match the popularized image, and
the pace of activities all around appear abnormally accelerated and
burdensome.
   ``Everything seems speeded up, the merchandising going into a
frenzy, people getting behind in their shopping and having to fight
crowds and traffic to do anything,'' he said. ``It zaps their energy
and their enjoyment, too.''
   More basically for many, the problem is shattered expectations,
he said.
   ``They've grown up thinking Christmas should be a big family
gathering, with gifts and everybody around and food on the table.
But that's often not the way things are.''
   In many cases, the contrast is acute for single people, for
one-parent families, for the homeless and other poor that ``don't
have enough money to get the one gift a child has wanted all year.''
   For these and others in similar circumstances, the typically
portrayed images of Christmas simply don't live up to the reality
and ``it's as if something had died,'' Fullerton said.
   ``It shows on them. They feel guilty. They blame themselves.
They're a lot harder on themselves in judgment than God would ever
be. By such harsh judgments, emotionally and physically, we're
ruining our health.''
   In the pamphlet for clergy, Fullerton said ``the church has the
unique opportunity'' to do two special things: to ``proclaim the
holiday season as a time for thanksgiving, expectation and
celebration,'' and to ``minister to those who do not feel thankful,
expectant or celebrative.''
   He said seasonal depression also can bring related illnesses such
as ulcers and headaches, and also result in family disputes and
violence. ``When people feel helpless and hopeless, the tendency to
lash out is greater. Law enforcement and victims' assistance
officers receive more requests for services'' than at any other time
of year.
   Although Christmas blues are quite common, he said many people
suppress them because ``they feel guilty or ahsamed,'' but a
sensitive pastor can spot those seeming listless, disinterested or
restless and offer comfort.
   He suggested pastors build sermons on cases of biblical
characters who endured despair, or inviting psychiatrists or
hospital chaplains to address church groups on anxiety and
depression.
   Help people to see the holiday blues as ``normal,'' he advised,
encouraging them to share their troubles with others. He said
pastors are not immune to the problem in this busy season, and tells
them:
   ``Be aware of your own limitations.''
   Fullerton said the holiday slump usually starts out as a kind of
``low grade depression,'' and a little help can stop it from
``getting even deeper down the line.
   ``A lot of deep-seated problems start like this, as a seasonal
problem, but those who stay in it get worse and worse and end up
very depressed.'' The results, he added, can be serious, such as
heavy drinking or suicidal impulses.
   But why this inconsistent mixture of sadness creeping into a time
of joy?
   ``I see it as strangely consistent in the Christian faith,'' he
said. ``At Christmas, there's an element of being down in the pit,
and God comes to you there.
   ``You couldn't accept it any other way, and the situation seems
you would never get out, but God comes in.''

   Bombs damaged government offices
in three white communities near Cape Town but caused no injuries,
police said today.
   Police said the first explosion damaged the magistrate's court in
Paarl, a wine-growing town where African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela was transferred to a prison farm Dec. 7.
   The explosion occurred overnight, police said.
   There did not appear to be any connection between it and
Mandela's presence at the Victor Verster prison farm in Paarl.
Mandela, 70, was moved from a Cape Town clinic, where he had been
treated for tuberculosis. He is serving a life sentence for plotting
to overthrow the government.
   Two other overnight bombs caused limited damage to municipal
offices in the Parow and Goodwood residential areas, police said.
   Two more bombs slightly damaged a police station and library
early Thursday in Randfontein, a mining center west of Johannesburg,
police said.
   Most bomb explosions in South Africa are attributed to ANC
members or other militants opposed to apartheid, under which the
nation's black majority has no voice in national affairs.

   Israeli troops today shot to death four
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in clashes that broke out
during a funeral for a Palestinian teen-ager, Arab doctors said.
   The confrontations came as the United States and the PLO prepared
for their first direct talks following PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's
renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel's right to exist.
   At least 19 Palestinians were wounded, three critically, during
clashes in the West Bank city of Nablus, city hospital officials
said.
   Four Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in villages near
Tulkarem in clashes with troops after prayers, Arab witnesses said.
One youth was wounded in the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Rafah, Gaza
hospital officials said.
   An army spokeswoman confirmed three fatalities and said the army
was aware of the report a fourth Palestinian was killed but could
not confirm it.
   The spokeswoman, who demanded anonymity, said there were nine
confirmed woundings in Nablus. Other reports were being checked, she
said.
   ``There were violent disturbances all over Nablus, and several
demonstrations were obviously planned ahead of time,'' she said,
adding that it appeared stones and tires were stacked in preparation.
   The army clamped a curfew on Nablus, the West Bank's largest
city, to curb rioting.
   The clashes were sparked by the death Thursday night of
15-year-old Ashraf Al Haj Daoud, who died of a gunshot wound
suffered during clashes Nov. 25, doctors at Nablus' Anglican
Hospital said.
   The youth's brother was one of those injured today, officials
said.
   The deaths raised to 328 the number of Palestinians killed in the
yearlong Palestinian revolt against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Thirteen Israelis have died.
   Nablus residents declared an impromptu general strike to protest
the teen-ager's death and clashes occurred in the youth's
neighborhood of Ras El Ein during a funeral march today, Arab
witnesses said.
   They said dozens of masked youths carried the coffin wrapped in a
Palestinian flag. As they marched, many waved the Palestinian banner
and chanted, ``We will avenge your blood, Daoud!''
   Some Palestinians then began to hurl stones at Israeli troops,
who opened fire, killing two Palestinians, Arab witnesses said. Two
more Palestinians died as clashes spread to other areas.
   Arab witnesses said heavy black smoke from burning tires filled
the air, and the wail of ambulance sirens was heard. Dozens of
roadblocks were erected by residents, and black flags of mourning
fluttered from many rooftops.
   Anglican Hospital officials identified three of the dead men as
21-year-old Yassin Sharshir, who was shot in the head; 20-year-old
Fayez Shaku, who was shot in the chest; and 18-year-old Iyad Abu
Helal, shot in the head and chest.
   The fourth victim was identified by family members as Nidal
Shafik, 26. They said he was shot in the neck and the chest.
   Among the Palestinians wounded in the clashes was Abdo El Haj
Daoud, 20, brother of the youth who was buried today. Doctors said
he was in critical condition with bullet wounds in the head and
chest.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Nearly All Vietnamese Advisers Have Left</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen said today all
of Vietnam's advisers and nearly three-quarters of its troops have
left Cambodia, but he said his government can defend itself against
the Khmer Rouge and other guerrillas.
   Noting that all Vietnamese troops are to be out of his country by
1990, Hun Sen said, ``We still have two years and we must race
quickly to get ready.''
   Hun Sen spoke to about 150 foreign correspondents as Hanoi's army
units began withdrawing from western Cambodia toward the Vietnamese
border. The partial pullout, said to involve 18,000 troops, began
Thursday and will continue until Wednesday.
   Hun Sen said his government would be willing to unconditionally
accept about 300,000 Cambodian refugees along the Thai-Cambodian
border and claimed they could be reintegrated into society within
six months. He said his government and the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees were close to signing an agreement for
repatriation of the refugees.
   The prime minister said Pol Pot remains the most important leader
of the Khmer Rouge and that titular president Khieu Samphan has no
military power.
   Khieu Samphan said in Paris this week that Pol Pot, who led a
reign of terror in Cambodia between 1975 and the 1978 Vietnamese
invasion, was no longer active in the leadership.
   Khieu Samphan has become the most visible of the Khmer Rouge
leaders internationally.
   Hun Sen said he would negotiate a peace settlement with Khieu
Samphan but still regarded him and other Khmer Rouge leaders blamed
for massive atrocities as unacceptable for any future political role
in Cambodia.
   Hun Sen said only 50,000 Vietnamese troops would be left in
Cambodia after next Wednesday, when six divisions would have
returned to Vietnam.
   He said all military and civilian advisers had left.
   ``This will not affect the balance of forces on the battlefield
due to our Cambodian troops who are in control of all areas from
which the Vietnamese have withdrawn,'' he said.
   ``Vietnamese assistance ... is considered very important, but
final success depends on the Cambodian people,'' he said. ``We still
have another two years, which we think is reasonable to build our
own forces.''
   He said his government would wage a ``people's war'' using local
and regional militia to eliminate the guerrillas. He admitted,
however, that these units face a shortage of ammunition and must
rely on a mix of ``traditional'' and modern weapons.
   ``We don't have the budget for a million troops, but all citizens
must master forces to defend their villages and districts,'' he said.
   Hun Sen said he met Thursday with Rafeeuddin Ahmed, special envoy
of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez De Cuellar, to discuss a
political settlement of the conflict.
   He said the two agreed that a dissolution of the pro-Hanoi
government in Cambodia prior to a peace agreement would ``certainly
bring chaos.''
   Hun Sen repeated his opposition to an international peacekeeping
force in Cambodia but said an international control commission would
be needed to supervise any political settlement.
   Hun Sen, who is regarded as the Phnom Penh government's most
capable political leader, also carries the foreign ministry
portfolio.

   The Trident 2 submarine missile today
logged its 13th success in 17 test launches, propelling a dummy
warhead package at an Atlantic Ocean target, the Navy reported.
   The three-stage, $23.7 million missile vaulted from a land launch
pad at 7:49 a.m. EST and darted southeast over the ocean. The Navy
reported 20 minutes after the launch that the test was a success.
   The 44-foot missile has a range of nearly 6,000 miles. Officials
would not say how far the warhead traveled today. Each Trident 2 is
capable of delivering 10 nuclear warheads to different targets.
   Three more test launches on land are planned before the Navy
begins test launchings from submarines.
   The missile is scheduled to become operational in about a year.
The Navy plans to install 24 Trident 2 missiles aboard each of nine
submarines.

   A federal jury today convicted a man and
woman of bilking thousands of lonely men nationwide out of $4.5
million with false stories of a garden paradise inhabited by nude
``love angels.''
   The jury deliberated 13 hours before convicting Donald S. Lowry,
59, of Bettendorf, Iowa, and Pamala St. Charles, 25, of Moline, of
mail fraud, conspiracy and money-laundering in their Church of Love
sex-fantasy scheme.
   Prosecutors said Lowry, a former English teacher who founded the
Church of Love in 1965, and Ms. St. Charles sent lonely old men nude
photos and letters from fictional ``love angels'' living in a
paradise called Chonda-Za.
   In exchange, Lowry and Ms. St. Charles solicited membership fees,
contributions and ``love offerings'' for the angels' supposed needs,
including garden seeds, winter coats and sewing machines,
investigators said.
   About 31,000 men nationwide contributed money to the Church of
Love.
   Lowry solicited models to pose nude for the photographs.
   ``I still feel what we did was right and that's what's
important,'' Ms. St. Charles said. ``People just continue to
misunderstand us.''
   Lowry said he had no regrets and vowed to continue his fantasy
letter business from behind bars.
   ``We made a lot of people happy,'' he said. ``That's all that
matters.''
   Prosecutors called the pair ``con artists, liars and
manipulators.'' Assistant U.S. Attorneys K. Tate Chambers and
Darilynn Knauss accused them of preying on men ``sick with the
illness of loneliness.''
   Defense attorney William G. Schick of Moline said his clients
conducted a ``legitimate business that helped a lot of people.'' He
described Lowry and Ms. St. Charles as ``dream merchants'' and the
letters as ``healthy fantasies.''
   Lowry faces up to 125 years in prison and $5.2 million in fines.
Ms. St. Charles faces 65 years in prison and $2.2 million in fines.
Sentencing was scheduled for April 7.
   Lowry used contributions to pay himself a huge salary, buy a
fleet of expensive cars and pay for sexual favors from some of the
models, the government said.

   Pass the spicy food; hold the aspirin.
   Researchers today reported that meals taken with aspirin are more
likely to harm the stomach than hot stuff.
   The doctors fed 12 healthy volunteers four meals: a bland steak
dinner; steak with three aspirin tablets; an enchilada dinner with
an ounce of jalapeno pepper, and half a pepperoni pizza.
   Once a week for four weeks, the eight men and four women, ages 24
to 43, ate one of the meals for lunch and dinner.
   The researchers found that stomach linings were much worse after
the meal with aspirin than after the Mexican food, pizza or bland
steak, the researchers said in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   The lining protects the stomach from digestive acids that can
cause ulcers.
   In a further experiment, the researchers sprayed Tabasco sauce
directly on the stomach lining. Examination later revealed bleeding,
but the researchers said they didn't know which ingredient to blame,
the red pepper or the vinegar.
   So they inserted jalapeno pepper directly into the stomach.
Examination later revealed no apparent damage to the lining, the
researchers said.
   The researchers concluded that ingesting spicy meals poses no
threat to the stomach linings of people who have no history of
stomach problems.
   The research was led by Dr. David Y. Graham of the Veterans
Administration Medical Center and Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston.

   Brewery workers at the Adolph Coors Co.,
which has been non-union for a decade, have voted against joining
the Teamsters.
   The vote count Thursday night was 1,081 against the union and 413
in favor, a Coors spokesman said.
   The balloting followed 18 months of union and company politicking
at the brewery, the nation's fourth largest. Coors has 1,600 brewery
workers.
   ``It came out loud and clear that they're satisfied at this
time,'' Dave Laughton, a Teamsters leader.
   ``We are delighted that our employees have decided that
third-party representation is not needed at Coors,'' said Peter
Coors, president of the company's brewing division.
   The brewery has been non-union since 1978, when workers voted
overwhelmingly to withdraw from the AFL-CIO after a bitter 20-month
strike.
   The dispute led to a nationwide labor boycott of Coors products
that officially ended in 1987 with an agreement between the brewery
and the AFL-CIO, including the Teamsters.
   Coors and the Teamsters agreed before the union representation
vote that win or lose, the boycott will not resume.
   Key issues in the election included wages and pensions.
   The Teamsters touted the wages recently implemented and the
pension plan under consideration at an Anheuser Busch Co. brewery.
Coors warned employees that Busch is four times as big as Coors and
can afford higher salaries and benefits.

   A man who was convicted of computer fraud as a
teen-ager faces charges of causing $4 million in damage to a
computer, stealing a security system and gaining access to
long-distance telephone codes.
   U.S. Magistrate Venetta Tassopulos on Thursday ordered Kevin
Mitnick, 25, held without bail.
   ``This thing is so massive, we're just running around trying to
figure out what he did,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Leon Weidman.
``This person, we believe, is very, very dangerous, and he needs to
be detained and kept away from a computer.''
   Mitnick was accused of damaging a Digital Equipment Corp.
computer, stealing a computer security system and obtaining MCI
telephone codes through university computers in Los Angeles and
England.
   His attorney, Anthony J. Patti, refused to comment.
   Mitnick is believed to the first person in the nation to be
prosecuted under a federal law against gaining access to an
interstate computer network for criminal purposes, the Los Angeles
Times reported.
   The FBI, the district attorney's office and the police said they
are just beginning to figure out Mitnick and his alleged high-tech
escapades.
   ``He's several levels above what you would characterize as a
computer hacker,'' said Detective James K. Black, head of the police
computer crime unit. ``He started out with a real driving curiosity
for computers that went beyond personal computers. ... He grew with
the technology.''
   If convicted, Mitnick could receive up to 20 years in prison and
a $500,000 fine.
   Mitnick served six months in a youth facility after being
convicted at age 17 of cracking Pacific Bell's computer to alter
telephone bills, penetrate other computers and steal $200,000 worth
of data from a corporation.

   Jurors resumed deliberations today in the

controversial political views should not sway their verdict.
   The jury of eight women and four men debated the complex case for
4{ hours Thursday and recessed until this morning. Chief U.S.
District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. said they should be prepared to
work through Saturday if necessary to decide all 49 counts involved.
   LaRouche and six associates were charged with mail fraud and
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $30 million in loans from
supporters without any intention of repaying them.
   In addition, LaRouche, 66, was charged with conspiring to defraud
the Internal Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses
paid by various corporations he controls and claiming he had no
taxable income.
   LaRouche has not filed federal income tax returns for any year
since 1978, government prosecutors say.
   If convicted of all 13 counts against him, LaRouche faces a
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and $3.25 million in fines.
   The six other defendants faced lesser penalties if convicted.
They are William Wertz, the chief of LaRouche's fund raising; Edward
Spannaus, legal coordinator for LaRouche, and fund-raisers Paul
Greenberg, Joyce Rubinstein, Dennis Small and Michael Billington.
   Bryan reminded the jurors before they received the case that
membership in a political organization, even one with ``honest
albeit controversial views,'' is lawful under the Constitution and
is not evidence of any criminal activity.
   The judge also said they should not attach any significance to
the fact that LaRouche was never summoned to testify in his own
defense during the 15-day trial.
   In his rebuttal to the closing defense arguments, U.S. Attorney
Kent Robinson told jurors the only issue they must decide is whether
LaRouche and his fund-raisers were lying when they assured
prospective lenders they would get their money back.
   Defense lawyers insisted that the fund-raisers made such
assurances in good faith, but Robinson said everybody in the
LaRouche organization knew they were part of a ``bankruptcy waiting
to happen'' when they solicited the loans, and probably wouldn't be
able to repay them.
   The result, the chief prosecutor said, was ``an enormous crime _
a $30 million crime'' in which LaRouche followers were being ``bled
dry.''
   Robinson denied defense lawyers' suggestions that the
government's charges were an attempt to ``quiet a political
movement.'' Defense lawyers claimed the LaRouche organization was
the victim of government harassment because of unorthodox positions
and a conspiratorial view of world events.

<HEAD>Part-time Soldier Killed In Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The IRA today set a one-week
deadline for families of British soldiers to leave Northern Ireland,
and its gunmen shot and killed an off-duty, part-time soldier.
   After the deadline passes, ``the responsibility for casualties
rests solely with them (the families),'' the Irish Republican Army
said in a statement telexed to news media in Belfast.
   In the statement, signed by P. O'Neill, a traditional signature
for the outlawed organization, the IRA claimed responsibility for
killing a member of the locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment
who was gunned down today. The regiment is a mainly Protestant unit
attached to the British army.
   Two gunmen fired at close range into the cab of a truck the man
was driving in a Roman Catholic working-class district of
Downpatrick, County Down, police said. He was delivering coal in the
town, which is 30 miles southeast of Belfast. The victim's name was
not immediately released.
   The gunmen fled in a car that was later found abandoned in the
district, a public housing estate called Model Farm, police said.
   The IRA threat to families of the 10,500 British troops deployed
in Northern Ireland followed three bomb attacks on British army
married quarters in the past month. The attacks caused no injuries.
   Britain sent troops into Northern Ireland in 1969 after sectarian
feuding flared. Since then nearly 3,000 people have been killed.
   In March, the IRA launched a campaign against British servicemen
and since then 44 have died. The toll includes four people who were
at British bases in continental Europe and one killed in an attack
on a London base.
   The part-time soldier shot today was the 12th member of the
6,280-strong Ulster Defense Regiment killed this year. Since 1969,
179 members of the regiment have been killed.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
the Republic of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. newspaper today said the author of
Nicaragua's Sandinista national anthem defected from his diplomatic
post in Spain, but the Nicaraguan Embassy denied the report and said
he never worked there.
   Embassy spokeswoman Claudia Chamorrosaid Carlos Mejia Godoy had
returned to Nicaragua.
   The Washington Times quoted unidentified diplomatic sources in
Washington and Europe as saying that the composer resigned his post
as cultural attache to the embassy about two weeks ago. He turned in
his passport and card as a senior member of the Marxist Sandinista
party, the newspaper said.
   ``We categorically deny this report,'' Chamorro said. ``In
addition, Mejia Godoy was never accreditted as a diplomat at this
embassy and was only in Spain on personal matters.''
   Mejia Godoy wrote the ``Sandinista Hymn,'' which describes the
United States as ``the enemy of humanity'' and is given equal
billing with the traditional Nicaraguan national anthem, the
newspaper said.
   The paper quoted one diplomat as saying that Mejia Godoy was
``lying low and doesn't want to make a big deal about it. But I was
told he was kind of fed up with things back in Nicaragua.''
   Mejia Godoy, 52, wrote anti-government songs that became popular
when the Sandinistas overthrew President Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   One of his songs, titled ``Monimbo,'' is often played on
Nicaraguan radio stations just before major government
announcements, the Times said.

   Drivers of cement mixers, floral vans and
tow trucks are being recruited as Drunk Busters in an effort to cut
down on drunken driving.
   The program unveiled by Jefferson County on Wednesday calls on 21
agencies and businesses with a fleet of nearly 3,700
radio-dispatched vehicles to ask that employees who observe drunken
drivers relay the information to police.
   ``Drunk Buster On Board'' stickers will be placed on the
vehicle's bumpers.
   ``By pulling this community together, we're showing that
Jefferson Countians are serious when we say, `We want it to stop,'''
said Jefferson County Judge-Executive Harvey Sloane.
   John Woodford, assistant executive director of Louisville's
transit agency, said the idea originated with a suggestion from a
bus driver days after a May 14 bus crash in northern Kentucky killed
27 people. The bus was struck head-on by an alleged drunken driver.
   Lt. Col. Dave Whalin, assistant county police chief, said it may
be difficult to apprehend drunken drivers by the time the tip is
relayed to a patrol car, ``but hopefully we'll have a car in the
vicinity that can respond immediately.''
   ``And the program should have a deterrent effect because drunken
drivers will know it's not just the police looking for them,'' he
said.
   Whalin added that motorists with car telephones can report
drunken drivers.
   Jerry Vincent, of a Teamsters local representing truck drivers
and corrections officers, said union workers would take part.
   ``Nobody wants them (drunken drivers) out there,'' he said.
   Roger Coffey, a tow service operator who is participating, said
``if the drunks saw some of these vehicles we tow in, maybe they'd
stop it. This carnage has got to stop.''

<TEXT>
   A 41-year-old Swede with a long criminal
record was arraigned today for the slaying of Prime Minister Olof
Palme and ordered to remain in police custody for further
investigation.
   Christer Pettersson, who was arrested Wednesday, pleaded
innocent. Prosecutors argued that there were reasonable grounds to
believe he killed Palme nearly three years ago, and that he should
be held while they build a case for trial.
   District Court Judge Mikael af Geijerstam found for the
prosecution during the closed negotiations.
   Pettersson covered his face with his hands as he entered the room
under guard from an emergency entrance. He wore blue jacket and
jeans and appeared nervous and confused as the hearing got under way
and he was asked to respond to murder charges.
   Palme, the popular four-term prime minister and a leader of the
world disarmament movement, was gunned down as he walked down a
Stockholm street with his wife the night of Feb. 28, 1986.
   Reporters were allowed to hear opening statements today before
the courtroom was closed for further deliberations.
   Under Swedish law, a suspect ordered to remain in custody can
continue to be interrogated by police while they build their case.
   Pettersson has a history of violent crime and a previous
conviction for manslaughter. He has been interrogated since he was
detained Wednesday.
   According to press accounts, a witness identified him in a lineup
as the man who was seen loitering outside the Grand Theater in
downtown Stockholm, where Palme and his wife saw a movie just before
the killing.
   Palme's killer followed the couple down the street from the
theater and shot him.
   Police have offered no motive.
   The initial murder inquiry focused on a political motive. Ousted
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr claimed Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini ordered Palme's slaying when the prime minister discovered
and stopped a Swedish company's illegal arms shipments to Tehran.
   Pettersson is the first suspect arrested in the case.
Investigators have been sharply criticized by several government
inquiry commissions for mishandling the manhunt and squabbling among
themselves.

   A moderate earthquake rattled Southern California a day after
snow and sleet blanketed the fire-blackened region, while
hurricane-force winds pounded Northern California, cutting power to
hundreds of thousands and leading to three children's deaths.
   The winds, clocked at up to 102 mph, died down Thursday night,
shortly before the temblor hit 500 miles to the southeast in a state
suffering in recent weeks from an attack of nature's worst elements.
   The winds fanned fires, uprooted trees and overturned trucks.
More than 575,000 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers lost power
Wednesday night and Thursday, said utility spokeswoman Jan Stewart.
By late Thursday, 22,000 remained without electricity. The wind also
knocked out power to more than 14,000 people in Southern California.
   Two people died as dozens of cars crashed Thursday in 10
accidents along ice-slick Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass 55 miles
east of Los Angeles, said Highway Patrol spokesman John Savage.
   ``One of the problems is here we don't have the snow equipment to
take care of this _ it doesn't happen here,'' said Highway Patrol
Officer Frank Stricker.
   Snow up to 7 inches deep closed lanes of Interstate 5 over Tejon
Pass north of Los Angeles, California's main north-south route, and
coastal Highway 101 near San Luis Obispo about 150 miles north of
the city.
   Thousands of motorists were stranded, travel elsewhere was
difficult and some schools in San Luis Obispo County were closed,
officials said.
   Weather forecasters predicted much of the same through the
weekend, saying 1 to 2 feet of snow was possible in southern
mountain ranges.
   The earthquake late Thursday rattled windows and knocked wall
hangings askew from Los Angeles to Palm Springs 110 miles to the
east. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries.
   The quake registered a moderate 4.8 on the Richter scale and was
centered 13 miles northwest of Palm Springs, said Hall Daly, a
spokesman for California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   Just a week earlier the Los Angeles Basin was swept by warm,
fierce Santa Ana winds. Wind-fanned fires burned dozens of homes in
two suburbs Dec. 8 and blackened 3,000 acres of brushy terrain the
next day.
   In northern Utah, canyon winds gusting to 115 mph knocked out
power to 50,000 people Wednesday and Thursday, and 3,000 remained
without power late Thursday, said Utah Power & Light spokesman Dave
Mead.
   Twenty-four schools and the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden
closed. At least five tractor-trailer rigs were blown over in Davis
County near Great Salt Lake and mail delivery in northern Utah was
delayed or halted, officials said.
   In Northern California, power outages led to two deadly
candle-sparked fires, officials said. In Berkeley, 3-year-old Oli
Asghar died Thursday and his family was left homeless.
   In Pittsburg, about 30 miles to the north, 6-year-old Mounkoun
Lee died late Wednesday of smoke inhalation after he was trapped
inside his burning home. His 5-year-old sister, Angela, died at
Children's Hospital on Thursday night.
   It caught fire after her parents neglected to extinguish a candle
next to a bed they were using for light when wind knocked out power,
officials said.
   In Sonoma County north of San Francisco Bay, ``we've had lots of
trees knocked down, power outages and phone problems,'' said Dan
Nicholas of county Emergency Services. ``Some homes have been
damaged to the point where the people had to be evacuated and put up
in motels overnight.''
   On the bay's long waterfront, the winds sent waves up to 10 feet
high slamming into seawalls and sank a 60-foot floating dock at San
Francisco's Pier 43. Piles of metal and other debris were left on
streets.
   A tugboat sank in Richardson Bay near Sausalito, two boats sank
at a China Basin dock just south of downtown San Francisco, and the
Coast Guard kept busy retrieving small boats torn from their
moorings, officials said. Famed attorney Melvin Belli's 110-foot
yacht, Adequate Award, was damaged when another boat dragging its
anchor slammed into his in Richardson Bay.
   Much bigger craft had problems as well. The aircraft carrier USS
Carl Vinson and its 3,000-man crew,wrapping up a six-month tour, had
to delay a holiday port call until today, said Petty Officer Roger
Turner.
   The wind blew out store windows in Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward,
and shattered glass blocked major roadways.
   Several trucks along a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 580
southeast of San Francisco were toppled, the Highway Patrol said.
   A downed power line in Sonoma County's geysers area sparked a
fire that burned 250 acres, but threatened no homes. In Tuolumne
County near the Nevada border, a controlled-burn fire flared and
blackened 100 acres. Several small fires were reported in the
Stanislaus National Forest.
   The winds also delayed flights and diverted air traffic to and
from San Francisco International Airport and caused elevators to
malfunction in the city.

<HEAD>Dutch Woman Shot in Tibet Arrives in Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Dutch woman who was shot in the arm and
accused of violating Tibetan laws won permission to leave China and
arrived in Hong Kong today.
   Ms. Christa Meindersma, 26, of Amsterdam, arrived in this British
colony aboard a train from the southern Chinese city of Canton.
   Holding her injured left arm in a sling, she told reporters she
was in Hong Kong for medical treatment.
   She said she also has come to the colony to ``testify for the
people who were killed or wounded like I am and about whom the
Chinese government doesn't seem to be worried or ashamed like they
are about a foreigner like me.''
   She is to hold a news conference Saturday.
   The woman was among at least 13 people injured during a Dec. 10
anti-government demonstration in the central square of Lhasa, the
Tibetan capital.
   Chinese officials have said a Tibetan Bhuddhist monk was killed
when police fired on protesters carrying a banned Tibetan flag near
Jokhang monastery.
   Western witnesses have said they saw two bodies, one of a small
child. They said Tibetans told them seven people were killed.
   On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said
Ms. Meindersma violated a law forbidding foreigners from mingling
with Tibetans during riots.
   He said she also violated customs regulation by bringing into
Lhasa a book by the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader. The book,
``My Land And My People,'' is banned in China because it advocates
Tibetan independence.
   Ms. Meindersma denied the accusations. She said she has been in
Lhasa since September studying Tibetan. And she told The Associated
Press earlier that she was reading the book to learn Tibetan. She
said stood not among demonstrators in Lhasa, but with a large crowd
of onlookers.
   During the shooting, she said a bullet entered her arm and exited
through her shoulder.
   Earlier this week, Tibetan authorities confiscated her passport
and barred her from leaving Lhasa. She was allowed to leave after a
request from her government.

<HEAD>Botha Calls For Racial Harmony on Afrikaner Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the holiest day in Afrikaner
history, President P.W. Botha called for racial harmony today on the
150th anniversary of the Great Trek that took white settlers into
the African wilderness.
   ``We must strive for national unity and for unity in our
different communities,'' Botha said in a speech to 15,000 whites
gathered at the Voortrekker Monument to the 19th century pioneers.
   His call contrasted sharply with a rival celebration by
extreme-right Afrikaner cultural and political groups, who view
Botha's limited race reforms as capitulation to the 26 million black
majority.
   ``This is a demonstration, a protest of the Afrikaner against
what is going on in South Africa, so-called reform,'' said Carel
Boshoff, leader of the Afrikaner Volkswag cultural organization that
sponsored nearby alternative celebrations. They also attracted about
15,000 people.
   ``We do not see (reform) only as political change, but total
cultural change,'' Boshoff said. ``We don't think it's possible for
the (white) South African nation to survive in that situation.''
   Afrikanerdom's most momentous event took place when
Dutch-descended Afrikaners left the British-ruled Cape Colony for
the country's uncharted interior.
   Stories of hardships on the Great Trek and battles with African
warriors have taken on mythical proportions for the country's 3
million Afrikaners, who dominate government and make up 60 percent
of the white population.
   The pioneer party, which included some blacks, vowed Dec. 16,
1838, to make the date sacred if they defeated a hostile Zulu tribe.
They did so in the Battle of Blood River.
   ``White, brown and black stood together in the laager (circled
wagons) at Blood River, in spite of those who want to suppress this
fact today in an attempt to justify their own standpoints,'' said
Botha. ``It was not only a trek of white Afrikaners.''
   All races were invited to the government celebrations, but only a
handful of non-whites participated.
   Extreme-right groups barred blacks from their ceremonies.
   Eugene TerreBlanche, charismatic leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, described the Battle of Blood River as the day
``when the white nation of Africa was born.''
   TerreBlanche called for Afrikaner unity, drawing cheers from his
followers in khaki uniforms with swastika-like patches.
   The 100th anniversary proved a catalyst that united Afrikaners
and propelled the National Party to power 10 years later. The
Nationalists have ruled uninterrupted since 1948 and codified the
apartheid policies of racial segregation.
   Blacks do not celebrate the holiday.
   But a coalition of anti-apartheid groups said they would pay
homage to the chiefs who fought the whites in the 18th and 19th
centuries.

   There may be no such thing as a free lunch, but six
teachers are being offered a $1,000 bonus just to go out to dinner
next semester with the parents of all their first-grade pupils.
   A relaxed meal together will give teachers and parents a chance
to discuss how parents can get involved in their child's education,
said businessman Philip Garvin, who is offering the bonus plus the
cost of the meals to Valdez Elementary School teachers.
   ``When the student goes to this special dinner and sees parents
and teacher together on this festive occasion, it should make an
impression that school is important,'' Garvin said.
   Garvin, president and owner of Norac Television Productions, also
gave $2,000 checks to five high school teachers deemed outstanding.
   He contends that businessmen should contribute to education and
that outstanding teachers, like valued employees in the corporate
world, should be recognized with cash bonuses.
   The only catch, said Garvin, is that the teachers must spend the
bonus on themselves, not on the classroom.
   Teacher Eloise Garcia said she is thrilled with the idea and will
use the money to ``throw a big party and celebrate.''

   The bodies of five Americans killed when
their locust-spraying plane was shot down by rebels have been handed
over to the U.S Embassy, government and U.S. officials said today.
   About 100 personal items of the five were handed over at a
ceremony Thursday, the officials said.
   The bodies were brought to the embassy by a Polisario Red Cross
unit. Polisario, the movement fighting Morocco for independence of
the former Spanish territory of Western Sahara, admitted it mistook
the U.S. plane for a Moroccan military jet and shot it down.
   The DC-7 was hit by a ground-to-air missile halfway between the
Mauritanian border and the defensive perimeter Morocco built against
the Polisario rebels.
   The victims have been identified as Wesley Wilson of North
Platte, Neb., Joel Blackmer of Phoenix, Ariz., Blackmer's son Frank
Christopher Kennedy, also of Phoenix, Bernard George Rossini of
Tempe, Ariz., and Francis Anthony Hederman of Cody, Wyo. The men
were under contract to the U.S. Agency for International Development.
   The FBI launched a criminal investigation into possible
violations of U.S. law, including one that deals with destruction of
U.S. aircraft overseas.
   The plane was the fifth shot down over the disputed territory
since the Sahara war broke out in 1975. Previous incidents involved
small French private aircraft.

   Two boys turned loose a pair of dogs on a
playground full of children, who ran and screamed as the animals
chased them and bit five of the youngsters, police said.
   ``I was playing catch at recess when I heard them yelling, `The
dogs are coming! The dogs are coming!' I climbed up the wall and I
kicked him (a dog) in the face when he started after me,'' said
Edgar Oliveras, a sixth-grader.
   Police searched for the boys who released the dogs Thursday
during recess for about 100 children at the St. Edwards Parochial
School, said Officer George Christman.
   Some victims identified the dogs as pit bulls, but police and a
spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals were unable to identify the breed.
   ``We weren't doing nothing to them. All I know is that they just
let go of the pit bulls,'' said Jerry Lopez, 10.
   He and four others were treated at St. Christopher's Hospital for
Children for wounds on their feet and legs. One of the injured, a
12-year-old who fell while running from a dog, suffered 35 bites and
cuts on his legs and feet.
   The attack ended when two men scared away the dogs.
   Elaine Newton, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania SPCA, said
several people in the neighborhood own pit bulls but that SPCA crews
were unable to find the dogs involved in the attack and were unsure
whether pit bulls were responsible.

accused of running naked through a sorority house have pleaded no
contest to indecent exposure and agreed to pay for underwear stolen
in the raid.
   The men were accused of running into bedrooms at Gamma Phi Beta
on Nov. 29 and demanding that sorority sisters sign their buttocks
to prove they were there. The women filed charges amid tension
created by several campus-area rapes.
   ``This isn't a good time to be doing this,'' Detective Michael
Schubring said of the panty raid.
   The men, all 18, entered the pleas Thursday. They face up to 90
days in jail. No sentencing date was set. Police said the men told
them they acted on a dare.

<HEAD>New U.N. Peacekeeping Force Prepared For Cuban Pullout From Angola</HEAD>

   A new U.N. peacekeeping force will monitor
the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, senior U.N.
officials said today.
   Angola and Cuba have agreed in principle to have the U.N. force
verify the pullout, said an official involved in planning the
southwestern Africa peace settlement.
   Another official said the force probably will be no larger than
50 men and is largely symbolic. U.S. spy satellites are expected to
provide the actual intelligence data that South Africa insists on.
Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Marrack Goulding, a U.N. undersecretary-general, has been meeting
this week with Cuban and Angolan officials to work out the size and
deployment of the force.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is to meet Cuban and
Angolan officials Saturday and Sunday to complete the discussions.
   The two Marxist countries Tuesday signed an agreement in
principle with South Africa pledging to withdraw the troops over 30
months, with half to be gone by Nov. 1.
   South Africa promised to start implementing a 10-year-old U.N.
independence plan for neighboring South-West Africa, the territory
better known as Namibia that it has ruled for 73 years.
   The force monitoring the Cuban withdrawal is in addition to plans
for 7,500 U.N. peacekeepers and 2,000 military police and civilian
officials to monitor the South African troop withdrawal from Namibia
and oversee independence elections.
   South Africa apparently wanted a U.N. force to verify the Cuban
withdrawal partly because the United Nations is monitoring its
pullout and it did not want to be seen as the only party requiring
international supervision.
   Under the accord, independence will begin April 1, when 3,000
Cuban troops are to have been withdrawn from Angola.
   Nov. 1 is the date set for electing a Namibian national assembly.
   A final agreement between South Africa, Cuba and Angola is to be
signed Thursday in New York.
   Cuban troops went to Angola in 1975 to help the government fight
invading South African troops and U.S.-backed rebels of the
right-wing National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.

   Police today said they found a radio
receiver that may have been used to detonate a nail-packed bomb that
injured the sheriff and a deputy.
   The bomb, contained in a bag left next to Sheriff Duffy Breaux
Jr.'s car, went off outside the Thibodaux Civic Center on Thursday
afternoon.
   Breaux, 60, suffered serious injuries to a hand and foot and was
admitted to Thibodaux General Hospital, said sheriff's Capt. Benny
Musso. Deputy Daniel Leche, 62, was in stable condition with
puncture wounds, Musso said.
   ``We can't think of anything in the recent past that would lead
us to believe (the sheriff) had some sort of enemy,'' Musso said.
``We don't know. As far as threats, we can't think of any that's
been made.''
   The fourth-term sheriff and Leche, a sheriff's office employee
for about 30 years, were leaving a Christmas party when they spotted
the bag, Musso said. ``He had to move it to get into the car, and he
kicked it and it went off,'' Musso said.
   ``We did find a receiving unit at the scene,'' Police Chief
Milfred Zeringue said, adding that authorities were not sure whether
the device was used to detonate the bomb. ``It could be either way.''
   Thibodaux Police Chief Milfred Zeringue said state and local
police, sheriff's deputies and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms would investigate.

   President Reagan said today the
Palestine Liberation Organization finally moderated its stand on
Israel because the United States was ``strong and steadfast'' in
support of the Jewish state's sovereignty.
   In a farewell foreign policy address to students and faculty at
the University of Virginia, Reagan said, ``That resolve has now paid
off.''
   As American officials prepared to begin a dialogue with Yasser
Arafat's PLO _ long branded by U.S. administrations as an
international terrorist organization committed to the destruction of
the Jewish state _ the president used his speech at Thomas
Jefferson's university to extoll the virtues of an America willing
to use its power and influence to affect vital movements on the
world stage.
   ``Today, we live in a world in which America no longer enjoys
preponderant power,'' the president said, ``but must lead by example
and persuasion.''
   ``Where we are strong and steadfast, we succeed,'' he said. ``In
the Persian Gulf, the United States made clear its commitment to
defend freedom of navigation and free world interests, and this
helped hasten an end to the gulf war.''
   ``And the country stood firm for years, insisting that the PLO
had to accept Israel's right to exist ... and renounce terrorism,''
he said.
   Later, in a question-and-answer session with university students,
Reagan said that opening a U.S. dialogue with the PLO has been ``a
great step forward'' for peace.
   But he also said that ``it is only going to come when the
principals come together to negotiate.''
   He said the opening to the PLO was possible because Arafat's
organization renounced terrorism and declared its acceptance of
Israel's right to exist ``without fuzzing it up with ambiguous
dialogue.''
   Reagan said Thursday that he wouldn't hesitate to ``break off''
the talks with the PLO representatives if Arafat's organization
failed to live up to its promises.
   The president's speech today was likely his last focusing
exclusively on foreign affairs, although White House officials have
said that Reagan plans a farewell address to the nation, probably
from the Oval Office in January, and he is expected to grant
reporters a series of curtain-closing interviews.
   In today's speech, Reagan also said that he was confident
U.S.-Soviet relations were on a positive course, and said that ``we
must keep our heads'' in dealing with the Kremlin.
   ``Serious problems, fundamental differences remain'' with the
Soviet Union, he said. ``Our system is one of checks and balances;
theirs, for all its reforms, remains a one-party, authoritarian
system that institutionalizes the concentration of power.''
   In Oval Office picture-taking sessions Thursday, Reagan said he
decided to reverse the 13-year-old policy of not talking directly to
the PLO after Arafat made clear Wednesday that his organization was
accepting Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism as a way
of achieving policy objectives.
   Reagan said then that Israel, which expressed regret at the
policy shift, should not be upset because the United States has
``not retreated one inch from our position of guaranteeing the
safety of Israel.''
   The president said the PLO's words ``must be matched by
performance, and if they're not, why, we're back where we started.''
   Questioned about what he would do if the PLO failed to live up to
its commitments, Reagan said, ``Well, we'd certainly break off
communications.'' He stressed that the ultimate solution in the
Middle East ``does not depend on outsiders _ or us.''
   ``Peace must be brought about by the involved nations meeting
with each other and settling their differences,'' he said.
   Asked why the United States does not recognize a Palestinian
state, Reagan said, ``... Because there is no such thing as of now.
There isn't a Palestinian state. And if you recognize someone ... as
that, it would be us declaring who was in charge there.''
   The U.S. reversal came a day after the administration said
Arafat's speech on Tuesday in Geneva before the U.N. General
Assembly had failed to meet its conditions. Arafat spoke again on
Wednesday in Geneva at a news conference, prompting the Reagan
decision to open talks.
   It was less than three weeks ago that Secretary of State George
Shultz denied the PLO leader an entry visa to address the U.N.
General Assembly in New York. The secretary of state had accused the
PLO of terrorism, and said Arafat was ``an accessory to such
terrorism.''
   For more than a decade, the United States has insisted that the
PLO accept U.N. resolutions adopted in 1967 and 1973 that affirm the
right of all states in the Middle East to live in peace. Israel is
not specifically mentioned. The United States also has demanded that
Arafat's organization renounce terrorism and accept Israel's right
to exist.
   Fitzwater said U.S. officials would move ``cautiously into the
dialogue'' with PLO represesentatives and that the talks would
``establish a foundation'' for the organization ``to prove that they
have changed their ways.''
   ``It's too early to speculate on how these things might take
place,'' he said. ``This is a first step ... and how the follow-on
steps will evolve, we really don't want to draw parameters at this
point.''
   ``We did have strong feelings about the PLO and we still have
strong feelings,'' Fitzwater said. But he said the administration
decided to permit contacts because there has been ``evidence of
change.''

<HEAD>Defense Secretary-Designate Tower Often a Loner in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the clubby confines of the United States
Senate, where even bitter enemies address each other with genteel
formality, John Tower often stood alone.
   The 63-year-old Texas Republican, picked by President-elect Bush
for defense secretary, possesses a sharp tongue and quick temper,
two traits that led him into numerous battles with other legislators
during President Reagan's first term, which saw the largest defense
build-up in peacetime history.
   A former college professor, Tower was narrowly elected to the
Senate in 1961, winning a special election to fill the seat vacated
by Lyndon B. Johnson when Johnson became vice president.
   Tower was named to the Armed Services Committee, where he made a
name for himself as an expert on the details of weapons systems and
defense policy.
   In 1980, Reagan swept into office, carrying enough Republican
candidates along with him to give the GOP control of the Senate.
Tower was a candidate at that time to become secretary of defense,
but the job went to Caspar Weinberger and Tower took over as
chairman of the Armed Services Comittee.
   The short, prickly Tower was the chief legislative champion of
Reagan's defense spending build-up, defending the larger budgets
against all critics. A deeply conservative critic of the Soviet
Union, Tower argued that U.S. defenses had been eroded to a
dangerously low level.
   In one 1981 incident, he got into a bitter shouting match over
military spending priorities with GOP Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska,
chairman of a rival subcommittee which also had jurisdiction over
Pentagon budgets.
   Tower strongly supported Reagan's build-up, although he could be
critical of the administration. For example, after loyally backing
administration decisions on the MX missile-basing controversy, Tower
became angry when officials couldn't agree on particulars. He moved
to block development until an acceptable plan was sent to Capitol
Hill.
   In 1984, facing another re-election campaign, Tower abruptly
retired, saying he'd had enough of the Senate.
   He became a high-priced Washington consultant and handled several
jobs for Reagan. Shortly after leaving office, Tower was named to
the U.S. team negotiating with the Soviets in Geneva for deep cuts
in long-range atomic weapons.
   Tower quit after 14 months in that post and friends said he had
been bored by the position. In November 1986, Reagan picked Tower as
chairman of the three-man presidential commission investigating the
Iran-Contra affair.
   During all that time, there was continuing speculation that Tower
would succeed Weinberger at the Pentagon. But when Weinberger
finally left last year, Frank C. Carlucci was named to replace him.
   Tower worked hard for Bush during the presidential campaign,
hoping finally to be named to the top Pentagon job _ the one
position he had coveted for years, according to friends.
   The son of a Methodist minister, Tower was in the Navy during
World War II. After the war, he worked as a radio announcer and
insurance salesman before teaching political science at Midwestern
State University in Wichita Falls, Texas.
   Tower began his national political life in 1960, when he ran a
losing Senate race against Lyndon Johnson, who was on the Texas
ballot both as senator and vice-presidential candidate. When Johnson
quit, Democrat William A. Blakley was appointed to succeed him, but
Tower beat Blakley by 8,000 votes in a 1961 special election. Tower
won re-election three times, each by a narrow margin.
   Tower has also been the subject of rumors about his personal
life, particuarly after his 1987 divorce from his second wife, Lilla.
   The divorce was granted after a legal battle in which she alleged
that Tower had committed ``marital misconduct'' and carried on
affairs during their 10-year marriage. Tower's deposition responding
to the charges was sealed by agreement of both parties.
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an extensive
background check into the rumors of Tower's extramarital affairs and
drinking.

   The United States and Greece today ended their
12th round of talks on U.S. military bases in the Mediterranean
nation without resolving ``important differences'' in the way of
extending an agreement that expires Tuesday, State Department
officials said.
   Once the five-year leases for four bases and about 20 additional
communications facilities expire, the United States has 17 months to
leave, one official said. The next round of talks on extending the
agreement is scheduled for January, said the officials, all of whom
requested anonymity.
   ``Important differences remain but the negotiations are not at an
impasse,'' said one.
   One major obstacle is a Greek demand that the United States close
its most visible base, the Hellenikon air force base in suburban
Athens. The base has been an irritant to nationalist and leftist
groups opposed to the U.S. presence in their country.
   Talks between the sides broke off in September after Greece
announced it would shut down Hellenikon once the lease expires.
About 1,400 American servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700
Greeks work at the base, which was established in the 1940s.
   Negotiations resumed Oct. 3 after Secretary of State George
Shultz met Foreign Minister Carolos Popoulias in Washington.
   Since the 1950s, the United States has operated four bases in
Greece. In addition to Hellenikon, there is a navy communications
base at Nea Makri near Athens, a Navy installation at Souda Bay on
the island of Crete and an Air Force communications base at Gournes,
also on Crete.
   The United States gives Greece more than $430 million a year in
military credits in exchange for the bases.
   The government of Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou has been
under heavy pressure to remove the bases, and the pressure is likely
to increase during the campaign for June elections in Greece.

   Southern Bell has scaled back service at four
drug-ridden housing projects, one of them so violent that mail is
delivered under police escort.
   ``We've had folks flash guns and pull knives on our installers
and threaten to use explosives on our vans. It's a compromise
between providing service and protecting employees,'' said Doug
Kendig, a telephone company spokesman.
   Mail delivery to Bankhead Courts was suspended Saturday, when a
letter carrier said he was caught near gunfire between suspected
drug dealers. Service to the 450 apartments resumed Wednesday under
police escort.
   City Council President Marvin S. Arrington said Thursday that
``anarchy almost exists'' in the project. He said residents have
attacked police officers and have not used an anonymous police
hotline to report drug activity.
   ``I just don't think that people living in Bankhead Courts know
exactly what they're doing to that community. They are going to
become an enclave unto themselves,'' he said.
   ``I think it's unfair to ask people to put their lives on the
line in these communities. We need to say to the residents, `You are
harming yourselves.'''
   Kendig said Southern Bell has restricted installation and repair
service, except for emergencies, to Monday mornings in Bankhead
Courts and the Englewood, Gilbert Gardens and Jonesboro South
apartments. Workers will enter in groups only.
   Southern Bell made its decision two weeks ago after a female
technician was harassed at Gilbert Gardens by six men who accused
her of being a police officer, he said. One man drew a gun while the
others rifled her van, Kendig said.
   The woman was released when the resident whose phone she had
repaired came outside and vouched for her, Kendig said.
   Police Chief Morris Redding said Southern Bell was overreacting.
``We don't have any projects that people cannot move in and out
of,'' he said.
   ``Bankhead Courts is not that bad. It's just got a reputation
right now,'' said Gwen Scales, daughter of the tenant association
president at the complex.

   President-elect Bush said today that he and
John Tower, his choice for defense secretary, pointment surfaced, but aides
said he has been a strong
supporter of SDI in negotiations with the Soviets in Geneva,
Switzerland.
   Edward Rowny, a special adviser to President Reagan on arms
control, said he has always known Tower to support Star Wars.
   But Graham said Tower sought to have a watered-down platform on
Star Wars adopted at the Republican National Convention in New
Orleans. The former general also said he fears Star Wars will fall
victim to budget-cutting in the early 1990s as Pentagon officials
seek to pay for existing weapons systems while aiming to cut the
deficit.
   But Wallop said early deployment of Star Wars ``is not a big
expense.''
   On the other side of the fence, some Democrats have complained
that Tower may be too close to defense contractors to make the tough
cuts needed to trim federal spending.
   Reagan's military budget, slated to go to Congress Jan. 9, calls
for increasing this year's total of $299.5 billion by 2 percent
after allowing for inflation.
   Bush has indicated he will settle for zero growth after inflation.
   Meantime, Wallop said he doesn't think Tower is ``so totally
crippled'' by the prolonged appointment process that he wouldn't be
an effective defense secretary.
   But both Democrats and Republicans, including Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., complained that Bush should not have kept Tower hanging.
Former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger said the delay ``may
have done damage to the office or to Sen. Tower personally.''

   American and Soviet negotiators have concluded
four months of talks on limiting underground nuclear tests without
agreement, Reagan administration officials said today.
   The round that ended Thursday had begun in Geneva on Aug. 29. The
negotiators adjourned without setting a date for resumption.
   But the negotiators made ``significant progress toward completion
of effective verification protocols,'' the White House said in a
statement Thursday.
   Disagreement centered on ways to verify compliance with 1974 and
1976 U.S.-Soviet treaties limiting underground nuclear blasts _ the
only kind still permissible _ to 150 kilotons.
   The treaties have never been ratified by the Senate. President
Reagan promised to seek Senate approval, but only after verification
measures were adopted.
   The Soviets have stopped pushing for a moratorium on further
tests and the two sides conducted two joint experiments on
verification measures, said a U.S. official speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   One test was held in Nevada in July and the second in
Semipalatinsk in the Soviet Union in September.

   President-elect Bush today named former Texas
Sen. John Tower to be the nation's next defense secretary, capping
an extraordinary semi-public debate over the retired lawmaker's
personal and professional fitness for the post.
   In making the announcement before reporters, Bush hailed ``my
friend Sen. Tower'' as a man of ``great experience, expertise and
commitment to peace and freedom.'' He said the former lawmaker is
committed to reforming the Pentagon.
   Tower thanked Bush for the appointment and said the nation must
have ``as much if not more defense for less money.'' He said that
would require reforming the defense purchasing system as well as
installing biennial budgeting. He said both depended on close
cooperation with Congress.
   Bush dodged but did not deny a question of whether he intends to
appoint outgoing GOP Rep. Jack Kemp _ a rival in the 1988
presidential campaign _ to head the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. Sources say that decision has been made, and that the
incoming president also intends to make Chicago transportation
official Samuel Skinner his secretary of Transportation.
   Bush met on Thursday with Dr. Louis Sullivan, a medical school
president and top contender to become secretary of Health and Human
Services and the first black in the Bush Cabinet.
   With Bush rushing to complete his Cabinet by the end of next
week, sources also said Gary MacDougal, a Chicago business executive
and Bush transition adviser, has emerged as a leading contender to
be secretary of Labor.
   Tower has held a variety of sensitive posts since leaving
Congress, including as a negotiator in arms control talks with the
Soviet Union and as head of a review board, popularly known as the
Tower Commission, appointed by President Reagan to probe the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Bush made the announcement of Tower's appointment in the
customary style, at an appearance before reporters that quickly
turned into a question-and-answer session.
   Asked about a possible meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, Bush said, ``There is no expectation that we will or
won't'' have a summit session. ``I don't want to send out a signal
that signals recalcitrance or unwillingness to think anew or
unwillingness to try to build upon progress,'' he said. But he said
he didn't want to ``send out the other signal'' and seem to be
acting hastily.
   He said Gorbachev and other Soviet officials understand his
viewpoint.
   The president-elect said he ``wouldn't overstate the importance''
of the United States beginning meetings with the Palestine
Liberation Organization. He stressed that the Reagan administration
has embarked on a dialogue and not a negotiation.
   As for Tower, some conservatives have complained that he is not a
strong supporter of the proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, known
as Star Wars. However, Bush said, ``Senator Tower and I agree with
... the position I took in the campaign, which is strong support for
SDI.''
   Tower himself said the proposed system would not only be a useful
deterrent to attack but also ``a very valuable negotiating tool.''
   Asked if that meant he thought of it only as a bargaining chip,
he responded, ``Not a chip, leverage, negotiating leverage.''
   Bush once had planned to name a defense secretary by
Thanksgiving, but delayed the decision pending the completion of an
extensive background check. That check delved into the former Texas
lawmaker's connections with the defense industry as well as with
allegations of womanizing and drinking problems.
   Asked whether he was satisfied with the investigation into issues
of a personal nature, Bush shot back: ``Issues or rumors?'' When the
reporter persisted, the president-elect said he was ``totally
satisfied.'' Bush said the ``most inquisitive'' members of the
Senate would be satisfied by the investigation, a reference to the
confirmation vote that Tower must win to take his Cabinet post.
   Bush also said Tower would emerge ``stronger'' for the lengthy
pre-appointment buildup. He refused to answer further questions on
Tower's personal life.
   Tower's appointment to head the Pentagon was first rumored in the
days immediately following Bush's election more than a month ago.
But it quickly sparked a highly unusual debate.
   One set of issues revolved around the former senator's ability to
control the Pentagon's bureaucracy and purchasing system,
particularly in light of his staunch support for President Reagan's
massive arms buildup in the early 1980s and the consulting contracts
he holds with five major defense firms. Tower retired from the
Senate in 1985 after 24 years, including the final four as chairman
of the Armed Services Committee.
   Tower's personal life also became grist for the transition mill.
Tower was divorced from his second wife Lilla in 1987. She alleged
``marital misconduct'' on his part during their 10 years together.
Tower's deposition responding to the charges was sealed by mutual
agreement.
   As the weeks dragged on, close aides to Tower telephoned
reporters assuring them that he understood that impeccable personal
conduct was required of the man who leads the Defense Department.
   Bush received a report on the FBI check into Tower on Thursday.
   Selection of Kemp, 53, for the Cabinet would cheer conservatives,
who so far have seen few from their ranks win top jobs in the
incoming administration.
   An also-ran in the Republican primaries last winter, Kemp was an
original sponsor of the 1981 tax cut legislation championed by
President Reagan and is an ardent advocate of government
deregulation.
   Transition sources said Sullivan, 55, president of Morehouse
School of Medicine in Atlanta, had the inside track for the job of
health and human services secretary.
   Sullivan, a longtime friend of George and Barbara Bush, met with
the vice president on Thursday to discuss the job. Transition aides
said he assured Bush he shared the vice president's anti-abortion
views.
   Sullivan is not the only black reportedly under consideration for
the Bush Cabinet, which already includes a Hispanic, Lauro F.
Cavazos, the holdover secretary of education.
   Retired Army Gen. Julius W. Becton Jr., who now runs the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, is reportedly in the running to head
the new Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Meanwhile, transition officials said Skinner, 50, chairman of the
Regional Transportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois, had been
offered the job of transportation secretary and had accepted it; and
that all that remained was for the appointment to be formally
announced.
   For labor secretary, MacDougal, 52, former chairman of Mark
Controls Corp., was reportedly among four candidates on a short list
for the job, along with Washington labor lawyer William Kilberg,
Patricia Diaz Dennis, a member of the Federal Communications
Commission, and Frank Doyle, a senior vice president for General
Electric Co. Constance Horner, the head of the Office of Personnel
Management, has faded as a top contender, administration sources
said.

   In an effort to reduce violent crime in Tibet's
capital, officials have outlawed the long, decorative knives that
many residents wear attached to their hips, a newspaper reported
Friday.
   The Chinese-language Ta Kung Pao said that although carrying the
knives is a part of Tibetan custom, many people in Lhasa, the
capital, have used the weapons in murders, robberies, rapes and
burglaries.
   So far this year, 25 people have been killed and 34 injured in 56
criminal cases involving the long knives, the newspaper reported.
   The Lhasa Public Security Bureau responded by forbidding
residents, businessmen, travelers and pilgrims from carrying knives
longer six inches.
   The newspaper said offenders would be punished and their knives
confiscated. The report did not say when the regulations took
effect, how many knives have been confiscated or what punishment
offenders face. It also did not say whether the knives were used in
recent anti-Chinese riots in Lhasa.

   The plan, adopted by the City Council Thursday, goes into effect
Saturday through Jan. 15, when officials will consider adopting it

<HEAD>US-PLO Talks Force Israel To Rethink Its Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization is forcing Israel to reassess its policy and construct
an alternative plan for Middle East peace negotiations.
   Washington's decision to meet with PLO representatives caught
Israel in the midst of complex talks on forming a new coalition
government and without an agreed-upon peace program.
   Politicians both left and right now are searching for a format
that would fulfill at least some aspirations of 1.7 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a rebellion
against Israeli rule began a year ago.
   They have focused on approaches that would exclude the PLO, which
prominent Palestinians say will not work.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the center-left Labor
Party, proposed elections in which Palestinians of the occupied
lands would choose local leaders with whom Israel could negotiate.
   ``We are facing a new situation,'' he told reporters. ``I hope
Israel will say to the Palestinians: Stop shooting and go voting.
Give up your bullets and go to your ballots.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who leads the conservative Likud
bloc and has vowed never to deal with the PLO, is described by aides
as recognizing the need for a credible Israeli plan.
   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, said in an interview the prime
minister is considering ``new moves'' to be announced when a new
government is formed.
   ``Be sure that Mr. Shamir is preparing a peace move which will
surprise everyone,'' he added on Israel radio, but refused to
disclose details.
   Ehud Olmert, a leading Likud figure, recommended that Israel
establish self-rule for Palestinians as envisioned in the
U.S.-mediated 1978 Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel.
Those accords led to the peace treaty of March 1979.
   ``This would be an Israeli initiative to bring about autonomy in
direct talks with the local population, which is the true partner we
need to talk with,'' Olmert said.
   The PLO rejects limited self-rule and is committed to creating an
independent Palestine, which Israel says would threaten its
existence. The Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature, proclaimed an independent state Nov. 15 in Algiers.
   Saeb Erakat, a political science professor at An Najah University
in the West Bank, said Palestinians would reject both autonomy and
elections.
   ``Palestinians will not buy products they don't like even if
there are new labels on them,'' he said.
   Erakat added, however: ``We always used to say there could be no
comprehensive peace without the PLO, but whether we like it or not
it is also true that peace can't be realized without Israel.''
   Shlomo Avineri, former director-general of Israel's Foreign
Ministry, said: ``Now you see the beginnings of a reassessment that
is reflecting the changes in the PLO. Now some in Israel are
demanding a rethinking of policy regarding negotiations with the
PLO.''
   He proposed some dramatic test of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat,
such as urging him to follow the path of Anwar Sadat, the late
president of Egypt, who came to Jerusalem in November 1977 to make
peace. Avineri is on the political science staff of Hebrew
University.
   One sign of a shift in Israeli thinking was a call for
recognition of the PLO by prominent Labor Party doves, among them
former Defense Minister Ezer Weizman and Uzi Baram, the party
secretary-general.
   ``We have to establish new policies that will not make us a new
rejection front,'' Baram said.
   Weizman, a former fighter pilot, said on Israel radio: ``A people
with such an air force and army and readiness to take a risk in
battle can also take a risk for a peace process.''
   Nimrod Novick, political adviser to Peres, said Israel must
develop a peace plan capable of reducing international pressure.
   ``If we put an initiative on the table, we force all other
parties to deal with it,'' he said on the radio. ``If we sit
quietly, we will be forced to deal with the initiative of someone
else.''

<TEXT>
   A black man arrested in a shootout that wounded
six white police officers was sentenced to five to 15 years in
prison on weapons charges, while 1,500 officers outside the
courthouse demanded the maximum penalty.
   ``I am not some racist brutal beast or killer that the drug
trafficking police are trying to paint me as,'' Larry Davis, 22,
told Acting Supreme Court Justice Bernard Fried on Thursday. ``I
challenge you to give me the same sentence as you would give your
own son.''
   The judge called Davis a ``violent, gun-carrying drug dealer'' in
sentencing him on weapons possession charges. Davis could have
received 10 to 20 years.
   A jury in the Bronx found Davis innocent Nov. 20 of attempted
murder and aggravated assault in the 1986 shootout. Six police
officers were wounded. Davis escaped unscathed through a window,
setting off a 17-day nationwide manhunt.
   Police had come to arrest him in the slayings of four suspected
drug dealers. Davis was acquitted of murder in that case on March 3.
   Prior to the sentencing, about 1,500 police officers incensed by
the verdict gathered outside the Bronx courthouse to demand the
maximum prison term.
   Davis at sentencing called Fried his ``persecutor'' and accused
him of having attempted to ``pre-try my case,'' at one point rolling
up his shirt sleeve and pants leg to show off injuries allegedly
inflicted by correction officers.
   The lead prosecutor in the case, Brian Wilson, said he was
disappointed by the sentence.
   Davis' attorney, William Kunstler, called it a ``racist
sentence.'' Davis must serve at least five years before being
eligible for parole.
   Kunstler had argued that police, without a warrant, came to the
apartment intent on killing Davis and that he fired in self-defense
when the officers began shooting without provocation. Prosecutors
contended Davis fired first.

   Mayor Tom Bradley says he will appoint a
full-time city official to coordinate efforts to fight the spread of
AIDS and promised $1 million toward housing assistance for AIDS
patients.
   ``While health services are mainly a state and county
responsibility, the city cannot idly sit by and watch as thousands
die each year from AIDS,'' Bradley said Thursday.
   AIDS activists had requested $5 million for housing assistance.
The $1 million announced by Bradley will provide assistance over two
years.
   Activist Chris Brownlie said the allocation will help get ``a
foot in the door for more money.''
   The AIDS coordinator's responsibilities will include promoting
AIDS education, advocating greater state and federal spending for
AIDS treatment, lining up transportation services to AIDS
outpatients and trying to determine those AIDS victims most in need
of help, officials said.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday blocked the
execution of a Sikh convicted of assassinating Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi and ordered the president to reconsider the man's request for
clemency.
   The order effectively prevented the execution of a second man
convicted in the 1984 assassination, a defense attorney said.
   A five judge-panel said the constitution allows President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman to examine the case and decide whether a
pardon is warranted.
   Kehar Singh, who was convicted of conspiracy in the
assassination, appealed to Venkataraman for mercy, but the president
dismissed the appeal last month, saying he could not consider the
merits of a case decided by the Supreme Court.
   The president's denial was appealed to the court, the nation's
highest.
   In its ruling, the court compared the U.S. and Indian judicial
systems:
   ``In the United States ... a pardon by the president has been
regarded not as a private act of grace but as a part of
constitutional scheme. We have no doubt in our mind that it should
be so treated also in the Indian republic.
   ``The petition invoking that power shall be deemed to be pending
before the president to be dealt with and disposed of afresh,'' the
court said.
   The appeal was filed 15 hours before Kehar Singh and another
Sikh, Satwant Singh, were scheduled to be hanged at New Delhi's
maximum-security Tihar Jail on Dec. 2. The death sentences have been
stayed since then.
   The men were convicted and sentenced in 1986 and their appeals
were rejected in 1986 by the Delhi High Court and in August by the
Supreme Court.
   ``They've done justice. It's a great judgment,'' said Rajender
Singh, Kehar Singh's son, who was present in court to hear the
verdict Friday.
   R.S. Sodhi, the lawyer for Satwant Singh, said the stay of
execution also applied to his client, but government officials could
not be reached immediately to confirm this.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot in the garden of her New Delhi residence on
Oct. 31, 1984 by two of her Sikh bodyguards. One of them, Beant
Singh, was killed in a shootout with other bodyguards minutes later.
   The other, Satwant Singh, was arrested after he recovered from
wounds received in the shootout. Kehar Singh, a maternal uncle of
Beant Singh, was arrested later and charged with conspiracy.
   All Sikhs take the name Singh, which means lion in the Punjabi
language, by doctrine of their faith.
   Mrs. Gandh's assassination was in retaliation for an army raid
she had ordered four months earlier on the Golden Temple, Sikhism's
holiest shrine.
   The shrine in Amritsar had been taken over by armed Sikh
militants demanding an independent homeland in the northern state of
Punjab. About 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died in the army
raid.
   Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but
are in a majority in Punjab. Sikh militants have been fighting for a
separate state since 1982, claiming discrimination by the Hindu
community, which makes up 80 percent of the country's population.

<HEAD>Payments to Doctors Could Cut Quality of Care, GAO Report Warns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cost-control incentives provided by Health
Maintenance Organizations serving Medicare patients could threaten
the quality of medical care by leading doctors to cut corners, a
congressional report says.
   The General Accounting Office, a congressional investigative
agency, says strong HMO management controls are needed to prevent
abuses.
   The report was issued this week at the request of Rep. Fortney H.
(Pete) Stark, D-Calif., who has been attempting to reach a
compromise with Health Maintenance Organizations on regulatory
legislation.
   Stark-sponsored legislation that was approved in 1986 would
outlaw in 1990 incentives paid by Health Maintenance Organizations
to their participating physicians to control the cost of services to
Medicare patients.
   That measure, however, was so sweeping that it would ban
profit-sharing payments and certain other benefits paid by even the
best-run HMOs to participating physicians. Congress thus can be
expected to take another look at the issue in the year ahead.
   Incentive payments have raised questions because Medicare pays
HMOs a fixed monthly amount for each beneficiary enrolled to provide
all health services covered by the program. The system gives the
HMOs an incentive to control services and make certain that
unnecessary ones are not provided. The HMOs often pass along
incentives to participating physicians.
   ``Many are concerned that the incentives given to the
participating physicians may be so strong that they represent a
potential threat to the quality of care by encouraging inappropriate
reductions in service,'' the report said.
   Stark, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's health
subcommittee, said in a statement that the report ``confirms my
fears'' that ``some HMOs may give so many incentives to doctors not
to order tests or refer patients to specialists that the quality of
care could suffer.''
   He cited a suggestion in the GAO's report that ``Congress may
wish to retain a ban on financial incentive arrangements that
closely link financial rewards with individual treatment decisions
and-or risk for services by physicians.''
   The report outlined four ways in which HMOs provide cost-control
incentives to physicians.
   Some pay the doctors a fixed amount of money for each Medicare
patient. ``Under such arrangements, physicians can be forced to fund
care out of their own pockets,'' the report said.
   Other HMOs distribute incentives among participating physicians
based on the cost performance of individual doctors. This could
dramatically affect the size of such payments, the report said.
   HMOs have at times paid participating physicians a percentage of
overall cost savings. The report said that could mean ``the greater
the potential for in appropriate reductions in services.''
   Finally, some physicians are measured for cost-control
performance over a short period of time. The report said it would be
better to take a long-term view of such matters.

   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh today
announced appointment of a three-lawyer trial team to prosecute
former presidential aide Oliver L. North while Walsh supervises the
continuing Iran-Contra investigation.
   Walsh said in a statement that he would oversee his office and
``continue dealing with the complex issues raised'' posed by the
large number of secret documents in the cases against North and
three co-defendants.
   Walsh, an experienced trial lawyer who once said he would like to
try the North case himself, said in a statement he would ``continue
to supervise the ongoing investigation'' of the Iran-Contra affair
and ``press for completion at the earliest possible date.''
   The independent prosecutor appointed associate counsel John W.
Keker, like North a Marine combat veteran of Vietnam, to head the
trial team. Keker will be joined by associate counsels Michael R.
Bromwich and David M. Zornow, both former federal prosecutors in New
York City.
   Keker is a founding partner in the San Francisco law firm of
Keker & Brockett. He graduated from Princeton University in 1965 and
went to Vietnam as a Marine officer.
   Following service in Vietnam, where one of his elbows was shot
off while leading an infantry platoon, Keker obtained his law degree
from Yale University.
   He later was a law clerk for then-Chief Justice Earl Warren.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who also served in
Vietnam, is accused of conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iran
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   His trial could begin as early as late January.

   The government was ordered Friday to pay 319
residents of a southern Japanese city $1.59 million in damages to
compensate them for suffering caused by noise at their local airport.
   Those compensated were among 507 residents of Fukuoka who filed
civil suits in 1976 and 1981 against the government. They asked for
a ban on night flights at the airport to end the noise pollution.
   The plaintiffs complained of stomach ulcers, sleeplessness and
hearing difficulties caused by nighttime military and civilian
flights, according to a court spokesman, Yuichi Shiona.
   The court ruled Friday it could not ban nighttime flights at the
airport, partly because of national security concerns outside its
jurisdiction, but it ordered the government to pay $1.59 million in
damages to 319 of the plaintiffs for suffering caused by the noise
pollution, Shiona said.
   The city is 560 miles southwest of Tokyo.

   Protesters jeered two American
officials outside an emotional memorial service for six people who
were killed when a U.S. military jet crashed in this central German
city.
   The service was held Thursday night, one week after the A-10
Thunderbolt II jet crashed, destroying several homes in a
working-class neighborhood.
   Loudspeakers broadcast the service to at least 1,000 people who
stood outside the packed Lutheran church, located near the site of
the tragedy.
   The crash killed five civilians and the American pilot and
renewed the public outcry over military training flights in West
Germany's crowded skies.
   The cause of the crash has not been determined. Air Force
officials say the aircraft was not engaged in a low-level flight.
   West German military officials have speculated the pilot may have
become disoriented when he flew into bad weather.
   The 60-minute memorial service was attended by U.S. Ambassador
Richard Burt, U.S. Air Force officials, West German Defense Minister
Rupert Scholz and representatives of state and local government.
After the service, Burt and the Air Force officers were jeered by
about 50 protesters outside the church.
   Several shouted ``Amis (Americans) Go Home!'' at Burt, and others
shouted ``murderers'' at the military men. Protesters also hooted at
Scholz.
   After the crash NATO defense officials suspended all tactical
fighter training flights until Jan. 2 in memory of the victims.
Mayor Willi Hartkopf said that period allows only enough time ``to
brush the tears from our eyes.''
   ``This mixture of horror, sadness and selflessness ... requires
us to do everything in our power to prevent something like this from
happening again,'' Hartkopf said during the service. His statement
was greeted with applause.
   Not counting the Remscheid accident, 12 major accidents involving
military aircraft have killed 95 people in West Germany this year.
   The victims include 70 people who died in August when stunt
planes crashed during an air show at the U.S. Air Force base in
Ramstein.
   Earlier Thursday, members of a Remscheid peace group and members
of opposition political parties held a vigil near the crash site.
   Members of the group carried placards saying ``Never Again
Remscheid'' and also demanded a halt to all low-level military
training flights.

   Homeless people seeking shelter from freezing
temperatures gathered Friday in a subway concourse a day after city
workers demolished a ``cardboard city'' that about 75 street people
had built there.
   The city crews Thursday morning removed the boxes, mattresses,
blankets, crates and makeshift furniture that some of the homeless
had brought to the cavernous underground passageway above one of the
city's subway lines.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode told a news conference that the action was
only a cleanup, not an eviction.
   ``We intend to clean up every day,'' Goode said Thursday. ``We
will not forcibly remove the persons who are there.''
   One homeless man, Charles Twiggs, 59, said he didn't blame police
officers who asked the homeless, most of them men, to leave to allow
sanitation workers to clean the area.
   ``That's their duty, that's their job,'' said Twiggs.
   Several of the homeless blamed the media in part for the cleanup
because of extensive coverage of their communal living in the
concourse.
   Workers for the Philadelphia Committee for the Homeless arrived
Thursday night to bring food for the returning homeless.
   Several members of a Philadelphia church prayed in a circle with
about eight homeless men, and workers from city-funded shelters
stopped by to gather the few who were willing to go with them.
   Police said they would not prevent people from returning to the
concourse, which the homeless have used for shelter for a decade.
   Terry Ryan, 19, had assembled one of the most elaborate cardboard
homes, using wire and two metal poles to combine several smaller
boxes into a 7-by-14-foot shelter, with plastic sheets to cut down
drafts.
   By Thursday morning, the shelter was disassembled.
   ``The (police) captain came to my door and asked me to tell
everyone to get out,'' Ryan said. ``I had three beds, a table and
chair, heat, had running water.''
   Ryan, who said he has been homeless for more than a year, said he
lived at the Broad Street subway concourse for the past 2{ months
with five friends in his ``condo.''
   Other homeless people said they were permitted to take what
belongings they could carry when the cleanup began.
   Police Capt. Lawrence Norton said the homeless left the concourse
on their own Thursday morning. ``We've had no problems,'' he said.
   Police had planned to evict the homeless officially from the
concourse. A police spokeswoman, Cpl. Theresa Young, said she did
not know why the decision was changed.

   A new immigration policy taking effect
today in the Lower Rio Grande Valley will prevent thousands of Latin
American aliens seeking asylum in the United States from getting
jobs and discourage them from traveling.
   Advocates for the aliens said the measure will sharply limit the
number of people granted asylum and cause overcrowding that could
overwhelm area social services.
   Omer G. Sewell, Harlingen District director for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, said the new procedure, which is also
being followed in Miami and Los Angeles, will make it tougher to
file frivolous applications for political asylum.
   ``We're going to provide almost instant service here in the Rio
Grande Valley and give them answers here and give them answers
quickly,'' Sewell said.
   Under the new policy, asylum applications will be processed
within 30 days, and applicants cannot work while awaiting a
decision, Sewell said.
   Aliens must also present their asylum applications at their point
of entry in the United States on a given appointment date, a new
procedure that does not actually prohibit immigrants from leaving
the area but makes travel unlikely.
   Previously, applications could take several months to process,
aliens were allowed to travel to their U.S. destinations and present
their asylum applications there, and they were generally allowed to
work in the meantime.
   But officials here and in such popular destinations as Miami and
Los Angeles say they are overwhelmed by the steadily increasing tide
of applicants.
   About 2,000 applicants arrive at the Harlingen office each week,
compared to a total of 405 for all of 1987, according to INS
records. South Texas is the closest and most popular crossing point
for undocumented aliens from Central America.
   Nearly 30,000 people, primarily Central Americans, have applied
for asylum with the INS in Harlingen since May 30.
   ``We are a outraged about this new policy at the immigration
service, because what it's going to do is hold people even longer in
the valley, intensifying the problem that we're already seeing with
homeless refugees in the streets, in shelters and in the motels,''
said Brian Szittai, chairman of the Rio Grande Valley Refugee Rights
Coalition.
   ``It sets up a procedure where I would be surprised if more than
1 or 2 percent are approved,'' said Mark Schneider, an attorney with
Proyecto Libertad, a Harlingen legal office that assists Central
Americans. ``You have adjudicators who are predisposed to denial and
it's going to be a masquerade.''
   The INS plans to send six additional adjudicators to Harlingen
early next year, Sewell said.
   ``We're going to provide almost instant service here in the Rio
Grande Valley and give them answers here and give them answers
quickly,'' he said.
   More than half of the asylum applicants are Nicaraguans. There is
a nationwide backlog of 21,000 pending asylum applications from
Nicaraguans, including 11,000 pending in the valley, officials said.
   Those denied asylum will receive letters telling them to leave
the country within 30 days, Sewell said. Applicants have the right
to appeal through the immigration court, the Executive Office of
Immigration Review.

<HEAD>New Sentence Ordered For Student Convicted On Gun Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college student with a criminal record
received too stiff a sentence when he was sent to prison for 15
years because he owned an Old West six-shooter that didn't work, a
federal appeals court ruled.
   Kevin Sherbondy, 23, of San Clemente was arrested in 1986 on the
day the federal ``career criminal'' law went into effect. The law
mandated a 15-year sentence, with no possibility of parole, when a
person with three convictions for violent felonies was found guilty
of being an ex-felon in possession of a gun.
   The unanimous decision Thursday by a three-judge panel of the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came 25 months after Sherbondy was
sent to Lompoc penitentiary. The 30-page opinion upheld the
gun-possession conviction but ordered a new sentence hearing in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles.
   Sherbondy's attorney, Dennis Riordan, said he will argue that his
client be released.
   Trial testimony showed the gun did not work and that Sherbondy
never used it after it was given to him as a gift when he was 16.
His grandparents, who reared him, said he kept the gun strapped to
his bedpost as a souvenier.
   The judges ruled that only two of Sherbondy's previous
convictions, both robberies, qualified as violent crimes. In the
third, Sherbondy was placed on three years probation for urging a
friend not to testify in a cocaine case.
   Riordan said Sherbondy held two part-time jobs while making the
honor roll in college before his conviction on the gun charge.
   Riordan was hired to represent Sherbondy by a group of people
concerned about his plight. The group included former San Francisco
Police Chief Con Murphy and state Court of Appeals Justice William
Newsome.

   Armenians can now make collect phone
calls to the United States for the first time, under an agreement
reached between the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Soviet
authorities.
   In a statement Thursday, the company said the agreement covers
only the Armenian Republic, which has spent the past 10 days digging
out from a devastating earthquake.
   ``This is the first agreement of its kind between AT&T and the
Soviet Union, and marks a dramatic lessening of restrictions for
Soviet citizens seeking to call the United States,'' the company
said.
   The volume of calls to and from the Soviet Union rose to eight
times the normal level following the Dec. 7 quake, said Rick
Matthews, spokesman for Morris Township-based AT&T International.
   AT&T said it is also sending 10 facsimile machines to Armenia to
help rescue teams coordinate relief plans with organizations around
the world.

   One boy was found dead and another nearly died
after swallowing solvent used to remove artificial fingernails,
doctors reported today.
   The doctors said in the Journal of the American Medical
Association that SuperNail Nail Off, made by American International
Industries of North Hollywood, Calif., contains acetonitrile, which
slowly converts to cyanide in the body.
   The makers of SuperNail Nail Off did not immediately return a
telephone call for comment today.
   Glue removers containing acetonitrile are produced by other
manufacturers as well and sold under various names, said Dr. E.
Martin Caravati of the University of Utah and Dr. Toby L. Litovitz
of Georgetown University Hospital.
   They said the government should consider removing such products
from the market. The products often are sold without childproof
packaging, they said.
   A 16-month-old boy who ingested SuperNail Nail Off one night was
found dead in his crib the next morning, and a 2-year-old nearly
died after swallowing some, the doctors said. The report did not
give the names or locations of the children.
   Acetonitrile is a colorless liquid often used in industrial
processes, the researchers said.
   SuperNail Nail Off removes the glue used to attach so-called
sculptured fingernails to the underlying nail.

   Christmas tourism has dropped sharply because of
the Palestinian uprising, and some hotel managers in the biblical
cities of Nazareth and Jerusalem say they have no bookings at all
for the holidays.
   The Tourism Ministry predicts that 70,000 visitors will arrive in
December, a decline of 14 percent from 1987, said ministry official
Mordechai Ben Ari.
   Before the uprising began a year ago in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, the ministry was predicting that 1988 would be a
record tourism year because it coincided with the 40th anniversary
of Israel's founding.
   But hotel managers said this will be a blue Christmas.
   ``This is the worst Christmas I've ever had,'' said Mustafa
Hamed, manager of the 65-bed Galil Hotel in the northern Israeli
town of Nazareth, where the Bible says Jesus spent most of his life.
   ``This year, the hotel is completely empty,'' Hamed said in a
recent interview. Six European groups that made reservations several
months ago for Christmas have canceled their bookings, he said.
   He said they apparently were scared off by the uprising in which
more than 320 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have died. The rebellion
in the occupied lands is aimed at ending 21 years of Israeli rule.
   In Arab east Jerusalem's 40 hotels, at least two-thirds of the
1,200 rooms will remain empty during Christmas week, said Fouad Abul
Haj, vice president of the Arab Hotel Association.
   ``The situation is very bad,'' said Haj, who also manages the
110-room National Palace Hotel where 80 rooms are vacant. ``Pilgrims
used to be our main business. Now they're not coming anymore.'' He
said seven smaller east Jerusalem hotels have closed for lack of
business.
   In Bethlehem, Mayor Elias Freij said many of the city's
traditional Christmas festivities have been canceled in solidarity
with the uprising.
   ``The Christmas party we hold every year on the 24th has been
canceled,'' said Freij, adding that there also will be no Boy Scout
parade, no city-sponsored decorations and no reception for diplomats.
   ``You decorate when you are happy,'' he said. ``The situation is
so discouraging, so tense ... that there is no spirit of joy.''
   The Tourism Ministry will hold its holiday activities in
Bethlehem, including choir performances in Manger Square on
Christmas Eve. Midnight Mass will be celebrated at St. Catherine's
Church, part of the Church of the Nativity complex built over the
cave where the Bible says Jesus was born.
   Nazareth also has canceled some festivities.
   Sofuan Fahoum, secretary to the mayor, said that there will be no
municipal decorations or any appeal to merchants to decorate their
shops.
   ``It's because of the situation in the territories,'' Fahoum
said. ``It's not the time to be happy.''

   Energy Department officials met behind
closed doors today with the governors of three Western states in an
attempt to resolve an impasse over storage of radioactive waste from
nuclear weapons plants.
   The governors of Idaho, Colorado and New Mexico conferred with
Joseph Salgado, chief deputy to Energy Secretary John Herrington,
and other regional DOE officials.
   ``I think all of us come here expecting to find a solution,''
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer said outside the hotel meeting room. ``We
ought to solve it today.''
   The immediate problem is finding a storage site for the
equivalent of 24 boxcars of radioactive material from the Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver. Seven boxcars of the
nuclear waste are sitting outside the plant.
   Romer said Rocky Flats, which manufactures plutonium for weapons,
will reach its capacity for temporary storage between March and May,
at which point he will require the government-operated plant to
suspend production.
   Waste has been stacking up there since October, when Idaho Gov.
Cecil Andrus turned away a boxcar headed for the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory and said the state would accept no more
shipments.
   The other question taken up today is when the government will
open a permanent waste storage site in New Mexico. The facility will
hold contaminated equipment and clothing in salt deposits more than
2,000 feet underground.
   On Thursday, Romer said the facility is not expected to open
before Rocky Flats reaches capacity.
   Doug Elmet, a DOE spokesman in Washington, said Thursday the
purpose of the meeting was to provide ``a chance for some straight
talk between the governors and the federal government.''
   Andrus said today he would not open the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory to shipments until the New Mexico facility
opens and DOE outlines a plan to remove more than 4 million cubic
feet of waste from the lab.
   Don Caviness, spokesman for New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers,
said his boss wants the Energy Department to provide a firm deadline
for opening the storage facility and an update on $240 million the
state has been promised.
   The money is to be used to build bypasses around major cities
through which waste would be shipped and to compensate for lost
mining royalties.
   Caviness said Carruthers would not permit the New Mexico facility
to open until those pledges are fulfilled.
   ``New Mexico has no intention of rolling over because the
governors of other states have problems,'' said Caviness.

   The Navy has decommissioned its last Hull
Class destroyer, signaling the end of the ``all-gun'' ships that
attacked with artillery power rather than missiles.
   ``I share with you a sense of history, as the last Navy
gunslinger is holstered,'' Capt. John F. Brunelli said at Thursday's
ceremony for the Edson at the Naval Education and Training Center.
   The Edson's three 5-inch guns supported group forces in Vietnam,
for which the ship won Meritorious Unit Commendations in 1967 and
1968. In 1968, the Edson fired more than 23,000 70-pound projectiles
and was named ``top gun'' destroyer by Naval gunfire spotters in
South Vietnam.
   The ship, commissioned in 1958, was named for Marine Gen. Merritt
Austin Edson, a Medal of Honor winner.
   Since 1977, the Edson has been used to train officers and
enlisted personnel in the Naval Reserve Force. The ship is scheduled
to be displayed at the Intrepid Air and Space Museum in New York.

<HEAD>Polio Could Be Eradicated from Western Hemisphere by 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of active polio cases in the Western
Hemisphere has dropped from thousands in Latin America alone in the
1970s to around 300 so far this year, giving hope the disease can be
eliminated in the region by 1990.
   Ciro de Quadros, a Brazilian epidemiologist, told a group at the
Johns Hopkins School of Public Health on Thursday that the public
health strides against the disease compare only to those against
smallpox.
   So far this year, thanks to mass inoculations of children in the
crowded barrios and remote villages of Latin America, health
officials say the number of cases of the muscle-wasting disease has
been reduced to a few hundred, de Quadros said. The decline has
encouraged the Pan American Health Organization to believe that
polio can be wiped out in the region within the next two years.
   ``We are extremely confident that the target can be met,'' said
de Quadros, an epidemiologist who is directing the polio eradication
program in the Americas for the subsidiary of the World Health
Organization.
   ``It's very hard work. The wild virus circulates in crowded urban
areas with poor sanitation. And we have guys out there working in
countries with civil war,'' he said. ``But they have a true sense of
accomplishment. They're doing something that has been done only once
before, with smallpox.''
   Polio, which attacks the nerves that control muscles and often
strikes children, began to fade from the United States and Western
Europe after the introduction of the injectable Salk vaccine in 1955.
   The oral Sabin vaccine followed shortly thereafter, and polio
vaccinations were made part of the standard children's immunization
schedule.
   The World Health Organization estimates there are 270,000 polio
cases annually, with more than half of those in India.

<TEXT>
   A new public school dress code bars students
from wearing gold jewelry, leather or fur coats and torn clothing at
middle and senior high schools.
   The dress code presented Thursday by school Superintendent
Richard C. Hunter takes effect in February. The rules, similar to
others adopted in Detroit and New Orleans, are part of an effort to
stem school violence.
   A task force on violence appointed by Hunter proposed adopting a
dress code along with other measures after a student was shot in a
corridor at Edmondson-Westside High School in October.
   ``The code will set the standard for what is unacceptable,'' said
Jacquelyn Hardy, spokesman for the school system. ``Each school will
adopt its own dress code to tell children what they should wear.
This just tells them what they shouldn't wear.''
   Hunter said students would be given time to conform to the new
dress code, but said violators probably would be sent home at
principals' discretion.
   Other items off-limits under the code include sweat suits or
jogging outfits, multiple rings or precious non-school rings,
pajama-type attire, hair rollers or curlers, slippers, shorts,
halter tops, see-through tops and apparel printed with vulgar or
obscene statements or statements related to the use of drugs,
alcohol, sex or violence.
   Joyce Quarles, an English teacher at City College, said clothing
often causes tension because of competition among students seeking
to outdress others. She said students have means of self-expression
besides clothing.
   ``Dress is one. Intellectual development is another. Clothing can
detract from the business of education. At first the students didn't
see that, but they came around.''

<TEXT>
   Two bombs exploded Friday at a campaign
rally of the main opposition leader. Police said Sirimavo
Bandaranaike was unhurt, but three of her supporters were critically
injured.
   Elsewhere, 19 people were killed in attacks blamed on a Sinhalese
extremist group and a shadowy new organization that opposes it, the
military said.
   The government began flying officials to Jaffna, a northern Tamil
city, to supervise Monday's presidential contest on this island
nation south of India.
   Extremists from the Sinhalese majority, fighting government
concessions to the minority Tamil, have vowed to block the election.
   The bombs exploded 200 yards from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party's
leader, who had just given a a speech, said a police officer who
demanded anonymity.
   ``Mrs. Bandaranaike is safe; we took her away soon after the
explosions. Three of her supporters were badly hurt; they are in a
very critical state,'' said the officer. ``There was lots of blood.''
   The meeting at Ratnalana, 10 miles south of Colombo, was the
former prime minister's last meeting before the election.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility.
   Sinhalese extremists killed nine party workers, a soldier and a
government agriculture officer, military officials said on condition
of anonymity.
   The bodies were found in several towns in southern and central
Sri Lanka. All were believed to be Sinhalese.
   Of the political workers, three supported President Junius R.
Jayewardene's United National Party and six the Sri Lanka Freedom
Party, the officials said.
   The bodies of eight other people, all believed to be Sinhalese
radicals, were found in various villages, the officials said. They
blamed these killings on the People's Revolutionary Red Army.
   The Red Army emerged suddenly a few weeks ago as the latest
lethal force in Sri Lanka's tangled web of armed bands and rival
ethnic groups.
   Villagers say the Red Army includes members of the
Sinhalese-dominated government's paramilitary forces and targets
young men suspected of belonging to the People's Liberation Front, a
Sinhalese extremist group.
   Military officers deny government troops are involved in the Red
Army and say the group is a spontaneous outgrowth of the people's
rejection of violence by the radical front.
   The government has blamed the front for the killings of more than
600 people, mostly Sinhalese, since July 1987, when the government
signed an accord designed to end guerrilla warfare and terrorist
attacks by Tamil separatists.
   The front said the accord, which was negotiated with India's
help, made too many concessions to the Tamils and that the
government sold out the Sinhalese. It vowed to kill anyone who
supported the accord.
   The predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese account for 75 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million people, and the Tamils, who are mostly Hindu,
18 percent.
   The accord granted Tamils a measure of autonomy in the north and
east. The Tamil insurrection began in 1983 and has claimed more than
8,500 victims, mostly Sinhalese.
   As the presidential election drew closer, the People's Liberation
Front stopped confining its attacks to government employees and
began targeting members of opposition parties competing in the
election.
   The front has demanded Jayewardene's resignation and the
immediate dissolution of Parliament. Jayewardene, who cannot seek a
third term under the constitution, has said Parliament will be
dissolved the day after the election.
   The front says the government will not conduct fair elections and
has demanded a multiparty caretaker government to oversee the
polling.
   More than 100 government workers were flown Friday to the Tamil
town of Jaffna to prepare for the voting, Election Department
officials said.
   Jaffna, now largely pacified, was once the chief stronghold of
Tamil separatists still battling Indian peacekeeping troops in the
north and east.
   Election Commissioner Chandrananda De Silva said 90,000 officials
will be deployed to man the 8,070 polling stations across the
nation. He denied rumors the election will be postponed because of
the violence.

<TEXT>
   A Russian Orthodox priest with only $40 left to
keep his jobs center open says the hard times are forcing him to
sell his prized possessions, two 19th-century French lithographs.
   The Rev. John DaeCheck, who operates the non-profit New Times
Service Center in nearby Glassport to help unemployed steel workers,
has an overdue telephone bill of several hundred dollars, and he has
already tapped businesses in the depressed Monongahela Valley for
donations.
   To raise money, he placed classified ads in Pittsburgh newspapers
Wednesday and Thursday offering two works by French artists Honore
Daumier and Jacques Villone for a total of $500. He estimates they
are worth $500 to $1,500 each.
   ``I have to do what I have to do and if I look stupid doing it,
that's too bad. I've had these for 20 years, but to keep the place
going, I'd sell them,'' he said.
   DaeCheck, 42, received 10 such lithographs as gifts when he was a
businessman nearly 20 years ago; the two are all that remain.
   ``Slowly and surely through my life, whenever a financial crunch
came up, I would sell one,'' he said. ``I'm terrible at asking for
money. It kind of tears something out of you to have to do that.''
   DaeCheck, assistant pastor of a small independent church in
Washington, Pa., founded the center seven months ago with $800 of
his own money and a monthly $50 stipend from his church. Job-seekers
are asked, but not required, to make a $2 donation for job leads and
a $5 donation for resume help.
   The agency, staffed by volunteers, has provided about 900
laid-off steel workers and others with a free, fast and simple way
to find employment and job training.
   On a wall in the cramped storefront office are about 1,000 job
listings, which are updated daily. Volunteers also help job-seekers
with resumes and career counseling and steer them to other agencies
if they need clothing, food or a place to live.
   ``I wanted to do something to help alleviate the unemployment
problem in our area,'' DaeCheck said. ``It seemed there were so many
people taking advantage of others with job services, many of which
charge fees of $60 or $80. What if you don't have any money? That
$60 or $80 could be someone's rent money.''
   Dennis Saputo, 34, of Lincoln, said he turned to the center when
other agencies failed to help. The agency recently found training
for him in asbestos abatement and volunteers helped him fill out a
resume.
   ``I've been on public assistance and have gone through their
programs and, quite frankly, they're a joke. They go through the
motions to help you, but they really don't help,'' said Saputo.
   ``This place here makes you feel good. They will do everything
they can to help you get going. It's the best program I've ever
dealt with, and I've dealt with enough to know.''

   A house fire started by youngsters playing with
matches killed an adult and four children, authorities said today.
   Three children escaped from the burning wood-frame home, which
was reported on fire around midnight Thursday, said Sumter County
Coroner James Campbell.
   ``They said they were all playing with matches,'' he said.
   The nearest occupied house was a half-block away, but the
children who escaped had to go two blocks before finding a home with
a telephone so they could call firefighters, the coroner said.
   Campbell identitied the dead as brothers Harold Wayne Evans and
Michael Evans, both 3; their 9-year-old sister, Shameka Evans; the
childrens' uncle, 21-year-old Nathaniel Evans, and his son, Tony
Chapman, 3.

<HEAD>Worst Flu Epidemic In 20 Years Sweeps France</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France has been hit with its worst flu epidemic in
20 years, and by Christmas one in five people will have suffered
from high fever, aching bones, stuffy nose and other unpleasant flu
symptoms, doctors say.
   ``The flu has hit harder and earlier than ever before,'' said Dr.
Jean-Marie Cohen, head of France's Regional Groups For Influenza
Observation.
   Cohen, a general practitioner, said one in three patients he
treats have ``la grippe.''
   The epidemic is currently making its way south from northern
France, where it surfaced two weeks ago, to the Riviera, where it is
expected to peak during the holiday season.
   More than 2 million people have been struck so far with this
year's variety, which doctors attribute to the A-H1N1 virus. It is
affecting mostly young adults and school-age children.
   ``The A-H1N1 virus caused a major outbreak of flu in the late
1940s, so people over 40 are likely to be immune to it,'' said Karin
Esteves of the Division of Communicable Diseases at the World Health
Organization in Geneva.
   Cohen said the virus first appeared during the summer in Britain
but did not reach epidemic proportions. Czechoslovakia was hard hit
in early fall, and Sweden is now in the grip of the flu.
   The A-H1N1 virus also has turned up in Canada and the United
States, with cases reported in Arizona, Michigan, Maryland, Texas,
South Dakota and Hawaii, he said.
   In the French city of Nantes, on the Atlantic coast, about 30
percent of school-age children have been bedridden with the flu. And
in some scattered towns around France, schools have been closed.
   Some doctors say recent transit strikes can be blamed for the
flu's rapid spread in the greater Paris region.
   ``Many of my patients have walked miles in the cold and rain to
get to work,'' said Dr. Joseph Danon, an ear, nose and throat
specialist. ``And when they do catch buses or subways, they're
crammed in like sardines, an ideal way to spread germs.''
   Cohen said it was virtually impossible to know why the flu struck
so early this year, especially since the weather in November was
relatively mild.
   In 1968, more than 30,000 people died throughout France during a
flu epidemic that lasted three weeks.
   Cohen was more optimistic for this year's epidemic because a
vaccination against the virus has been on the market since early
Oct. With 12 percent of the population vaccinated, it is expected to
reduce incidence of the flu by 20 percent.
   Though doctors say the flu does not rank among the ``serious
illnesses,'' it does cost the French economy billions of dollars.
   In 1985, workers missed 16 million days of work because of flu,
costing the French economy $1.5 billion. Many companies have begun
vaccinating employees free of charge or for a nominal sum.
   French pharmaceutical companies, however, did not produce enough
vaccine to meet the demand, and many pharmacies are sold out.

   Housing construction in November reached its
highest level in seven months, the government said Friday in a
report cited as further evidence of a robust economy.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units last
month, up 1.4 percent from the October rate of 1.54 million.
   It was the third increase in a row and the highest level of
construction activity since April. Housing starts soared 5.1 percent
in October and rose 0.4 percent in September.
   Housing permits, a good barometer of future housing activity,
edged up 0.1 percent to a rate of 1.52 million units, the highest
level since June 1987. The slight gain followed a robust 8.8 percent
increase in October.
   The strength surprised analysts, who for many months have been
saying that rising interest rates would dampen the housing sector.
Activity this year is down from last year, but not by as much as
expected.
   ``Home buyers are simply either ignoring or looking through all
the uncertainty that surrounds interest rates ... and saying, `Hey,
I've got a job, things look pretty good, my company is growing, it's
time to buy a house,''' said James Christian, chief economist of the
U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   He cited an unemployment rate near 14-year lows and strong sales
of new homes from June through October, which pushed the backlog of
unsold homes below a six-month supply for the first time in a year
and a half.
   ``Builders are going to build them if people are going to buy
them,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, economists say mortgage rates will probably edge
higher through the middle of next year and will eventually take
their toll on housing. A higher rate increases monthly mortgage
payments.
   Rates on fixed-rate mortgages, which fell from about 10} percent
in mid-August to 10[ percent in late October, have since climbed
back to nearly 10{ percent, according to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.
   ``The housing industry is clearly slowing down. ... There are
some areas of the country still doing fairly well, but others have
slowed significantly,'' said Kent Colton, executive vice president
of the National Association of Home Builders.
   He predicted housing starts would total 1.5 million this year,
down from 1.62 million last year and a recent peak of 1.81 million
in 1986. Next year, they will head still lower, to about 1.37
million, he said.
   For the first 11 months of the year, starts were running 9.1
percent behind the same period of last year.
   Single-family homes in November were built at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million units, the highest since March
and up 0.8 percent from a month earlier. Single-family starts shot
up 9.3 percent in October.
   Apartment construction, a volatile subcategory, rose 3.0 percent
last month to 412,000 units after a 5.2 percent decline in October.
Because of high vacancy rates and less favorable tax treatment of
real estate investment, apartment starts are running far below their
1986 peak of 669,000 units.
   By region, housing starts shot up 12.9 percent in the Northeast
to 228,000 units. They rose 4.8 percent in the South to 612,000
units, the highest rate in a year. Starts dropped 8.3 percent in the
Middle West and fell 2.2 percent in the West.
   Housing activity has been strong in California in recent months
because of brisk population growth and weak in the Northeast, partly
because of high prices.

   A group that promotes peace handed out teddy
bears Friday to youngsters who dumped their war toys in a trash can
at a day care center.
   ``We encouraged children to bring in a toy that promotes violence
and they received a cuddly teddy bear,'' said Margaret Matthews, the
Toledo YWCA's child care director and member of the YWCA's Peace
Coalition.
   ``The idea that we are trying to share with children and parents
is that war toys scare bears, and disarmament begins at home when
you educate children about non-violence and peaceful playthings,''
she said.
   The children brought in a gamut of toys ranging from Uzi
submachine guns that squirt water to battery-powered tanks. In
exchange, the group handed out 32 teddy bears.
   ``They were very much aware of what was going to happen. They put
the toys right in (the trash can) and went over and got their bears
and a badge that said `War Toys Scare Bears.' They were real
pleased,'' she said.
   War toys promote violence and aggressive play among children, she
contended.
   ``Children do have violence in play. And when it is something
they create on their own, without adult influence, I do not think
there is anything really wrong with that.
   ``But when they are playing with air-to-ground missiles that are
obviously adult-created and really created by toy companies, then we
are really influencing their play too much.''

   MCA Inc. has suspended an executive accused of
funneling money from the entertainment conglomerate to a reputed mob
figure.
   The company Thursday announced the suspension of Eugene
Giaquinto, president of MCA's home entertainment division and a
corporate vice president.
   FBI documents, filed in support of wiretaps on Giaquinto's
telephone, allege that he funneled ``a large amount of money on a
yearly basis'' to Edward Sciandra, reputed underboss of
Pennsylvania's Bufalino crime family.
   Robert Hadl, MCA vice president and general counsel, said MCA,
which sells records and videotapes and makes movies under the
Universal Studios name, isn't a target of the probe, which was
reported by the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.
   The company has ``no information that any money was passed by
anybody to Mr. Sciandra, or to anybody else,'' but will investigate
further and cooperate with the government, said MCA legal
representative Ronald Olson.
   The money allegedly passed through North Star Graphics, a
Clifton, N.J., company that has a $12 million to $15 million a year
contract to package MCA's videocassettes, including the top-selling
``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.''
   Hadl said MCA had terminated its agreement with North Star, but
refused to say why or when.
   Sciandra and North Star were implicated in 1981 in a $68,000
false invoicing scheme that apparently defrauded MCA. Sciandra and
two others were later convicted of tax evasion.
   Giaquinto's attorney, Richard P. Crane Jr., was not in his office
this morning, his secretary said.
   MCA's home video division had two tapes among this year's top 10
best-sellers, ``American Tail'' and the ``Callanetics'' exercise
video.

   Gunmen today seized three Irish soldiers
from the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon in retaliation for
Israel's abduction of a Shiite Moslem guerrilla leader, police and
U.N. officials said.
   Lebanese police said the men who seized the Irish soldiers
demanded the return of guerrilla leader, Jawad Kasfi, who was
kidnapped Thursday.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said it detained Kasfi and three
guerrillas suspected in raids against the army. ``The suspects are
undergoing interrogation,'' the army said in a statement.
   The army announcement did not say where the guerrillas were held.
   In the port city of Sidon, eight people died when Shiite Moslem
militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas battled with mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns, police said. The
fighting sparked fears a major confrontation would negate a
20-month-old truce.
   Timor Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
said the three Irishmen today ``disappeared in the village of
Tibnin,'' which is 13 miles north of the Israeli border.
   The Irish battalion's headquarters are at Camp Shamrock just
outside Tibnin.
   Goksel said in a statement that U.N. forces backed by mainstream
Shiite Moslem Amal militia will search until they find the missing
men.
   Reliable Lebanese sources identified Kasfi as a leader of the
Iranian-backed Shiite Hezbollah, a fundamentalist movement at odds
with Amal.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said four gunmen in two cars seized the Irish soldiers,
bundled them into a white Mercedes-Benz and sped away.
   He did not name the hostages.
   Amal, which regularly cooperates with the U.N. force,
``threatened to crack down on the kidnappers if the three soldiers
were not released by nightfall,'' the spokesman added.
   He declined to identify the kidnappers saying, ``We will not
identify them now to give peaceful efforts a chance.''
   Israel has said Kasfi has planned and led raids against its
forces and the South Lebanon Army in Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone.
   Lebanon today ordered its U.N. Ambassador Rashid Fakhoury to
protest to the Security Council about Kasfi's abduction.
   Armed Tibnin villagers Thursday retaliated by seizing three other
Irish troopers. But they released them after an hour when Amal
promised the U.N. force would try to locate and return Kasfi.
   The nine-nation U.N. force patrols a zone that overlaps Israel's
self-designated security zone, an area 6-10 miles deep.
   In Sidon, residents said sirens echoed throughout Ein el-Hilweh
Palestinian refugee camp on the port's southern outskirts and the
hilltop village of Maghdousheh, above the shantytown, as fighting
raged.
   Police said it erupted in the afternoon shortly after two
Palestinian guerrillas were killed when a rocket-propelled grenade
fired from Maghdousheh hit their jeep.
   Four other guerrillas and two Amal militiamen were killed in
fighting after the attack.
   Amal fought Palestinian guerrillas for two years before the
Syrian-sponsored truce took hold. More than 1,500 people were killed
and 3,500 wounded in the fighting.
   In a separate development, the South Lebanon Army said its
militiamen killed two Arab guerrillas today in a firefight near the
Christian town of Marjayoun. The statement gave no details.

   James Lamont ``Haven'' Gillespie, who wrote
the lyrics for ``Santa Claus is Comin' To Town,'' will no longer be
without honor in his hometown.
   City officials unveiling a historical marker Thursday at Goebel
Park said there was no better time than Christmas to honor Gillespie
on the 100th anniversary of his birth. He was born Feb. 6, 1888, in
the northern Kentucky city and died in Las Vegas on March 14, 1975.
   Gillespie, author of some 1,000 songs, wrote the lyrics to his
most famous song on the back of an envelope in 1933 and collaborated
with J. Fred Coots on the music. Eddie Cantor made it famous when he
sang it on his radio program in 1934.
   City Commissioner Irvin Callery said Thursday he became
interested in 1984 in having the city recognize the songwriter
``because I couldn't find anything to honor him,'' Callery said.
   Callery said Gillespie's famous Christmas song has ``brought joy
to millions of people. Anyone who hears it remembers childhood.''

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha marked the
Afrikaners' most sacred day Friday by calling for racial cooperation
in South Africa, but a rival celebration by rightist Afrikaners
protested recent racial reforms.
   Friday marked the 150th anniversary of the Great Trek that took
white settlers into the African wilderness on wagons drawn by oxen.
   ``We must strive for national unity and for unity in our
different communities,'' Botha told whites gathered at the
Voortrekker Monument, dedicated to the 19th century settlers.
   People from throughout the country arrived in Pretoria on wagons
this week to commemorate the 1838 Great Trek.
   During the original journey, one of the pioneer parties vowed on
Dec. 16, 1838 to make the date sacred if it defeated the Zulu army
led by King Dingaan. They did so in the Battle of Blood River.
   ``White, brown and black stood together in the laager (circled
wagons) at Blood River, in spite of those who want to suppress this
fact today in an attempt to justify their own standpoints,'' Botha
said.
   His call for unity and his acknowledgement that blacks
participated in the trek and fought the Zulus contrasted sharply
with the rival celebration staged nearby by rightist Afrikaners, who
view Botha's recent limited racial reforms as capitulation to the
nation's 26 million black majority.
   Botha's National Party calls for gradual race reforms and limited
power-sharing, while the right-wing Afrikaners oppose all such
reform.
   ``This is a demonstration, a protest of the Afrikaner against
what is going on in South Africa, so-called reform,'' said Carel
Boshoff, leader of the Afrikaner Volkswag, a cultural group
sponsoring the alternative celebrations.
   ``We do not see (race reform) only as political change, but total
cultural change,'' Boshoff said in an interview. ``We don't think
it's possible for the (white) South African nation to survive in
that situation.''
   Both celebrations drew about 10,000 people Friday.
   The Great Trek, the most momentous event in Afrikaner history,
began in 1838 when the Dutch-descended Afrikaners left the
British-ruled Cape Colony for the country's uncharted interior.
   Stories about hardships on the journey and battles with African
tribesmen have taken on mythical proportions for the country's 3
million Afrikaners, who dominate the government and make up about 60
percent of the white population.
   The government billed its Great Trek celebrations as open to all
races, but only a handful of blacks participated _ as drivers of the
oxen teams.
   The far-right groups barred blacks from attending their
ceremonies.
   The right-wing groups staged a mock Battle of Blood River, with
several dozen bearded men in buckskin outfits taking cover behind
wagons to defeat imaginary Zulu warriors. There were no actual black
opponents present, only a taped recording of Zulu war cries and
drumbeats.
   Andries Treurnicht, leader of the Conservative Party, the chief
Parliamentary opposition, told the right-wing rally: ``It is the
right of the Afrikaner nation to be ruled by its own people.''
   ``If Europe's nationalities have the right to live in separate
countries, what is wrong with the white South African nation living
apart from the non-whites?'' he said.

   Hopefully, Dr. Grammar will never see
``hopefully'' used again as it is in this sentence; but he's just
about given up hope.
   Dr. Grammar, alter ego of English Professor Richard Tracz,
handles 10 to 20 grammatical questions a day on his telephone hot
line, but he says he's all but powerless in the fight against
erroneous _ but popular _ word usage.
   Tracz, author of several textbooks on English composition,
originally established ``The Write Line'' to help students at Oakton
Community College in Des Plaines, where he teaches.
   The 44-year-old Tracz is hardly as schoolmarmish as his position
as a call-in grammar guru might imply. He said Thursday his callers
are often disappointed when he suggests that they trust their own
judgment.
   That's not to say that there isn't a lost cause Tracz is willing
to fight for. Without a fondness for lost causes, he wouldn't be a
grammarian in 20th-century America.
   ```Hopefully,' when it's used to mean `I hope,' is one of my pet
peeves, but I can't stop people from using it that way _ even though
it makes no sense,'' Tracz said.
   ``It's a losing battle,'' he admitted. ``It'll be like `ain't.'
Teachers kept explaining that `ain't' wasn't in the dictionary, but
people kept using it, and it's in the dictionary now. People will
keep on using `hopefully' the wrong way until standard usage permits
it.''

   Is it art or is it just ``weird''?
   The design for a sculpture featuring an alligator in Victorian
garb pushing an egg-shaped baby carriage and other fanciful bronze
figures is not drawing rave reviews from school board members being
asked to spend $75,000 to place the piece outside a new high school.
   Members of the Montgomery County Board of Education said this
week they want to send the art work back to the drawing board.
   ``It is weird,'' said school board member Sharon DiFonzo. ``I
don't want to say to the artist, `This is ugly,' but it doesn't do a
thing for me, and I can't see it doing a thing for Watkins Mill High
School.''
   The 38-by-39-foot sculpture was designed for the courtyard of the
new high school when it opens next fall in suburban Gaithersburg,
about 15 miles northwest of Washington, D.C.
   The design shows a big-beaked bird preening in a renaissance
costume; an archaeologist named Dr. Digwell excavating pots; and the
dressed-up alligator pushing a carriage shaped like an egg with
legs. Inside the egg, a wise old man sits before a computer keyboard.
   The sculpture was chosen by a committee of school officials,
parents and students from entries submitted by artists across the
country.
   Reached in San Francisco, the sculptor, 36-year-old Lorraine
Vail, defended her work.
   ``What I wanted to do is to make a rather sterile courtyard
environment into a place where you could hang out,'' Ms. Vail said.
``You get to sit on the steps. Even if it is a little crazy, I would
love to go have lunch with Dr. Digwell or one of the other
characters.''

   U.S. and PLO officials today met for 90
minutes in their first official direct talks on peace in the Middle
East, ending a long U.S. boycott of the Palestinian organization.
   ``It is our hope that this dialogue, as it develops, will help
bring about direct negotiations that will lead to a comprehensive
peace,'' U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau told reporters
following his meeting with a four-man PLO delegation.
   He described the discussions as ``practical and characterized, I
would say, by seriousness of purpose.''
   The first meeting came two days after Washington declared that
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's recent statements on renouncing
terrorism and recognizing Israel met conditions for beginning
contacts.
   It took place in an official Tunisian government guest residence
in suburban Carthage, north of Tunis. Yasser Abd-Rabbou, a member of
the PLO executive committee, led the Palestinian delegation.
   Abd-Rabbou called the first session ``practical and
constructive'' and said he expected the next U.S.-PLO meeting would
come within several weeks.
   ``We hope this dialogue will bring us closer to an international
conference on the Middle East,'' he said. ``We hope this dialogue
will continue and we think it will continue.''
   In Madrid, a Spanish Foreign Ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Pelletreau had been holding meetings
this year with PLO representatives under the auspices of the Spanish
embassy in Tunis.
   Pelletreau has denied any previous meetings with the PLO.
   Western diplomatic sources in Tunis, briefing reporters on the
condition that they not be more precisely identified, said earlier
today that there would be no detailed exchanges at the meeting, and
that afterward it was likely there would be ``a period of
assessment.''
   The American side had planned to open the meeting with a clear
statement of Washington's attitude toward terrorism, and say the
United States expected Arafat's words would be matched by his
actions, a high-ranking diplomatic source said.
   The United States expects that the PLO's renunciation of
terrorism will be ``prominent and pervasive,'' a diplomatic source
said, but also understands that Arafat does not control all
Palestinians, nor all acts of terrorism.
   The sources said Washington would expect the PLO to dissociate
itself clearly from any future acts of terrorism.
   The second American agenda item, according to the sources, would
be a statement of Washington's general principles and approach to
Middle East peace.
   Pelletreau, once held hostage by Palestinians, telephoned PLO
headquarters Thursday to make the initial official contact,
according to the PLO and U.S. Embassy spokesman Adnan Siddiqi.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz designated Pelletreau as the
U.S. government's ``only authorized channel of communication'' with
the PLO.
   Today in Tunis, Palestinian flags appeared in the front of many
homes and businesses, news reports said.
   Arafat was not in Tunis and it wasn't known when he would return.
He met East German leader Erich Honecker in Berlin on Thursday
before heading to Romania.
   East Germany was one of the first countries to recognize the
independent Palestinian state declared by PLO leaders at a meeting
last month.
   Pelletreau, ambassador to Tunisia since March 1987, is one of the
most experienced and knowledgeable American diplomats on Arab
affairs.
   The Long Island native speaks Arabic and French and has served in
Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. He once was
ambassador to Bahrain.
   His first encounter with Palestinian terrorism came in September
1970 when guerrillas of George Habash's extremist PLO faction
diverted three airliners to Amman, Jordan, and took the passengers
and crews hostage. He later escaped.

<TEXT>
   A 41-year-old Swede with a long criminal
record pleaded innocent Friday to killing Prime Minister Olof Palme
in a case that has frustrated this orderly nation for nearly three
years.
   Christer Pettersson was arraigned at Stockholm District Court,
and a judge ordered him held for further questioning. Press reports
hailed his arrest Wednesday as a breakthrough in the investigation.
   Palme, a four-term prime minister who championed leftist causes,
human rights and disarmament, was killed Feb. 28, 1986 while walking
home unguarded from a late movie in downtown Stockholm with his wife.
   The assassination shocked Sweden, which prides itself on its
orderliness, tolerance and lack of political violence.
   Public records show Pettersson has a history of psychiatric
treatment and drug and alcohol abuse.
   His record includes convictions for at least 63 offenses,
including manslaughter for stabbing an alleged drug addict to death
with a bayonet in 1970 a few blocks from where Palme was killed.
   Pettersson covered his face with his hands as police escorted him
into a room at Police Headquarters, where the hearing was held for
security reasons.
   Chief Prosecutor Anders Helin argued that there were reasonable
grounds to believe Pettersson killed Palme and that he should be
held while the state builds a case for trial.
   District Court Judge Mikael af Geijerstam found for the
prosecution at the closed negotiations but ruled that Pettersson
must be formally charged before Dec. 30. Prosecutors can extend his
detention indefinitely by showing cause.
   Swedish press accounts said witnesses picked Pettersson out of a
lineup as the man who was seen loitering outside the Grand Theater
while Palme was inside watching a Swedish film, ``The Mozart
Brothers,'' with his wife, Lisbet.
   The gunman followed the Palmes down the street and shot the prime
minister at close range with a .357-caliber Magnum revolver. Lisbet
was slightly wounded. The weapon has not been found, and
investigators have offered no motive for the shooting.
   Tabloid press accounts, quoting friends of Pettersson, say he
belonged to a nationalist group with neo-Nazi sympathies and made no
secret of his hate for Palme, a Social Democrat. Other stories
portrayed him as a heavy drinker and drug user with no politics.
   Arne Liljeros, the public defender representing Pettersson, said
he was not surprised by the court's decision.
   ``We defended ourselves as well as we could,'' he said.
   Helin and chief detective Hans Olvebro met with reporters after
the hearing but refused to answer substantive questions about the
case.
   Olvebro, the third man to head the investigation, took over in
February after two years of public infighting between police and
prosecutors and after government commissions accused police of
incompetence.

<HEAD>IRA Kills Soldier, Gives Servicemen's Families One Week To Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army on
Friday shot and killed a part-time soldier and set a one-week
deadline for the wives and children of British soldiers to leave
Northern Ireland.
   The outlawed guerrilla group, which launched a campaign in March
against British servicemen, made it clear that it regarded the men's
families as legitimate targets.
   The deadline for the wives and children was the first set by the
IRA, which is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   ``The IRA from today is giving seven days to the British army to
evacuate their families from the north of Ireland. After that, the
responsibility for casualties rests solely with them,'' the group
said in a statement telexed to news media in Belfast.
   The statement was signed P. O'Neill _ a traditional IRA signature.
   About 10,500 British troops are deployed in Northern Ireland, all
living in barracks complexes. The British army refused to comment on
the warning or say how many had their families with them, but
unofficial estimates put the figure at between 1,500 and 2,000.
   The IRA threat followed three bomb attacks on British army
married quarters in the past month _ one on the outskirts of
Londonderry, one at Lisburn where the army is headquartered, and one
at Antrim. No one was injured.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the slaying Friday of an
off-duty soldier. The victim was a member of the locally recruited
Ulster Defense Regiment attached to the British army.
   John Moreland, 37, from Clough, County Down, was the 12th member
of the 6,280-strong regiment killed this year and the 94th victim of
sectarian violence this year. He was married and had two children.
   Police said two gunmen fired at close range into the cab of the
truck Friday morning as the soldier drove into a Roman Catholic
working-class district of Downpatrick, County Down, 30 miles
southeast of Belfast.
   The attackers fled in a car which had been stolen from a family
that was held hostage by gunmen in a nearby public housing estate,
police said. The car was later found abandoned.
   Nearly 3,000 people have been killed since Britain sent troops
into Northern Ireland in 1969, including 179 men from the Ulster
Defense Regiment.
   The IRA's stepped up targeting of British servicemen since March
has claimed 44 casualties. The toll includes four servicemen who
were at British bases in continental Europe and one killed in an
attack on a London base.

<TEXT>
   They only moved in a month ago, but the
guest list for a couple who have set up a Christmas spectacle
outside their new home is starting to run into the tens of thousands.
   John and Gloria MacKoul say they have averaged 1,000 visitors
nightly to the house they had barely finished building in November
when they unveiled a display of lights, trees and Christmas
characters, live and mechanical.
   ``I guess we're so happy, we wanted everyone else to be, too,''
said Gloria MacKoul. ``Just to see the faces of the children is
enough for me.''
   The display includes three Christmas trees at their picture
windows and one in a loft, 40 moving dolls on their octagonal
staircase, life-sized mechanical reindeer and carolers, 30 Disney
characters on the front lawn, and several friends and neighbors
acting as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, Mrs.
Frosty and assorted helpers.
   Mrs. MacKoul said she and her husband, an electrical contractor,
designed the house just for the Christmas spectacle that they have
planned for years. Even the carpenters who built the house donated
their services to make a stable for the life-sized Nativity scene
that was lifted by crane onto a ledge in the front yard.
   And the MacKouls show the spectacle for free.
   ``A lot of people come in and are very skeptical. They walk out
and are very moved,'' Mrs. MacKoul said.
   Word about the house has spread so fast through the central
Massachusetts city of 180,000 people that the MacKouls get thank-you
cards addressed only to ``the Christmas house.''
   Their doors are open nightly until Dec. 24, when Santa takes off
to deliver presents, but the house reopens from Dec. 26 to New
Year's Eve. The couple counts 1,200 visitors on weekend nights and
they average 900 on weekdays.
   Their neighbors in the expensive development have not raised a
fuss about the sudden stream of guests. ``We haven't heard one
complaint and the traffic is unbelievable,'' she said.
   One neighbor, an Orthodox Jew, even dons a moose suit every night
to entertain children.
   The couple have collected Christmas figures for years with an eye
to the production. Their daughter, Jennifer, 15, made the Disney
figures for the yard.
   The Nativity figures were imported from Italy with the vacation
money the couple had saved.
   The MacKouls, who have lived their entire lives in the Grafton
Hill section of the city, hosted a smaller version of the Christmas
spectacle in their former apartment there, but most of the guests
were neighborhood children.
   They prepared this year's display behind shaded windows in the
weeks before Thanksgiving to keep it secret. The lights went on
Thanksgiving night and within minutes cars began stopping.
   Their visitors have included a motorcycle rider in black leather
who thanked them profusely and children without coats.
   Mrs. MacKoul said older visitors are particularly touched by the
display.
   ``We have people crying sometimes. They can't believe we're
letting them in the house,'' she said.

<HEAD>Mother Accused Of `Delivering' Cocaine To Unborn Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANFORD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose son was born addicted to
cocaine was charged Friday with child abuse and delivery of the drug
to her baby, a felony drug charge prosecutors say has never been
used against a new mother.
   Michael Hudson was born Nov. 13 addicted to cocaine and infected
with syphilis. He has been treated and placed in a foster home
awaiting adoption.
   His mother, Toni Suzette Hudson, 29, was arrested Thursday on a
street corner known for drug sales. She remained in custody in the
Seminole County jail in lieu of $2,000 bond.
   Other Florida prosecutors have charged mothers of addicted babies
with child abuse, but never with violating drug laws, said Jeff
Deen, Seminole-Brevard assistant state attorney.
   Conviction of child abuse generally carries a sentence of no more
than 60 days. The drug charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years.
   Deen said he could prosecute Ms. Hudson for delivering the drug
because state law defines it simply as a transfer from one person to
another. He plans to argue that the mother transferred the drug to
Michael by ingesting it.
   Ms. Hudson, who is unemployed and lives just east of Altamonte
Springs, gave birth to Michael at Florida Hospital Altamonte, where
urine tests showed the infant and mother had cocaine in their bodies.
   The hospital reported the case to the state Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services as required by law when pregnant women
appear to be drug users.
   HRS investigator Patsy Buckley interviewed Ms. Hudson four days
after Michael was born, according to the arrest report. The mother
admitted using cocaine almost daily throughout her pregnancy, the
report says.
   Ms. Hudson told investigators she had used cocaine for about
three years and even used the drug while in labor before entering
the hospital.
   ``Buckley advised that Hudson told her that she was not addicted
to crack cocaine but tremendously enjoyed using crack cocaine, and
it made her life worthwhile,'' the arrest report says.
   Michael's cocaine addiction was sufficient evidence for Deen to
subpoena Ms. Hudson's hospital records, which showed cocaine in her
body. A pediatrics expert told investigators the only way a newborn
could be addicted to cocaine would be if the mother used the drug.
   Next week, authorities plan to arrest three more women on child
abuse charges. The women being sought followed a similar pattern of
drug abuse, sheriff's spokesman Roy Hughey said.

   A man who helped sell substandard electrical
wire used in nuclear submarines and then apologized in a $26,000
newspaper ad for defrauding the Defense Department was sentenced
Friday to 4{ years in prison.
   ``I was very, very wrong and I'm sorry,'' Lawrence Koffler, 54,
of Providence, R.I., told U.S. District Judge Clifford Scott Green,
fighting back tears.
   However, the judge turned down a defense plea for probation
because ``the offenses are very serious.''
   Besides the prison term, Koffler was fined $15,000, ordered to
pay $47,000 for the cost of prosecution, given three years'
probation when he is released from prison and ordered to perform 750
hours of community service during that probationary period.
   In a plea-bargain agreement 13 months ago, Koffler pleaded guilty
to one count of conspiracy to defraud, five counts of mail fraud and
two counts of filing false income tax returns.
   He previously made restitution to the government of $475,000 and
paid $3.7 million to settle his income tax liabilities.
   Koffler cooperated with the government during its lengthy
investigation of conspiracy, bribery, tax evasion and mail fraud
charges that, overall, resulted in conviction _ either at trial or
through guilty pleas _ of 43 defendants in a scheme that defrauded
the Defense Department of more than $5 million.
   Last week, in an advertisement he placed in The Philadelphia
Inquirer, Koffler said he was ``disgusted with what I had done'' and
appealed to others who do business with the government to avoid
cheating.
   ``Please learn a lesson from my mistakes,'' he said in the ad.
``Don't make the almighty dollar the guiding force for your business
decisions. If only one person learns from my mistakes, then
something good has come out of this.''
   The government said it demanded a prison term because Koffler, as
vice president of marketing for Carol Wire and Cable Co. of
Pawtucket, R.I., was critical in carrying out the scheme.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Karl Lunkenheimer said Carol, in its
sales to companies that shipped the wire to the Defense Industrial
Supply Center in Philadelphia, made product substitutions that were
extremely dangerous.
   ``Substituting tin-coated wire for silver-coated when used in
guided missiles, nuclear submarines, tanks, jet bomber-fighters and
other critical military systems created a risk of the destruction of
extremely expensive military equipment and the crews involved in
using it,'' Lunkenheimer said in a memorandum.
   Koffler's lawyer, Thomas Ostrander, said ``the sentence wasn`t
what we expected, but Mr. Koffler thinks it is fair.''

<TEXT>
   Greece will tell the United States by the
end of the year to start closing U.S. military bases, but
negotiations for a new agreement will continue into 1989, the
government announced Friday.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said the current
five-year operating agreement for the four American bases ends on
Dec. 20, and ``the 17-month removal period begins.''
   ``During that period the conditions of the agreement remain in
force,'' Kostopoulos said in a statement.
   The statement was issued after Greek and American negotiators
ended a 12th round of talks in Athens on Friday.
   Negotiations for a new bases agreement began in November 1987 but
have made little progress.
   The spokesman said negotiations will continue into 1989 and
``during the entire 17-month removal period to ascertain the margins
existing for a possible new agreement.'' He said another round of
talks will begin in January.
   Kostopoulos said that in this week's talks, although ``a deadlock
was not reached, a considerable gap in views continues to exist on
many issues.''
   In Washington, a State Department official said, ``Important
differences remain but the negotiations are not at an impasse.'' The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Talks broke off in September when Greece said that Hellenikon Air
Force base adjacent to Athens airport would not be included in a new
agreement and would have to close.
   Negotiations resumed in October after Foreign Minister Carolos
Papoulias discussed the issue with Secretary of State George P.
Shultz in Washington.
   Kostopoulos' statement noted Greece's decision to shut down
Hellenikon.
   About 1,400 servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700 Greeks
work at the base, set up in the late 1940s to help distribute
Marshal Plan aid to war-torn Greece.
   Hellenikon has been an irritant to nationalist and leftist groups
opposed to the U.S. presence in Greece.
   The spokesman also repeated a Greek demand that a new agreement
would have to serve Greece's ``highest national interests'' and said
a new accord would have to be approved in a national referendum
before it is signed.
   Greece wants a new accord to guarantee that the U.S. will help it
solve some of its longstanding disputes with neighboring Turkey. The
two NATO allies are at odds over military control of the Aegean Sea,
its seabed mineral rights and Cyprus, which is divided into Greek
and Turkish sectors.
   U.S. officials don't want to involve regional politics in the
bases talks.
   Three other bases have been operating in Greece since the early
1950s _ a Navy communications station near Athens, a 6th fleet
supply base at Souda Bay on the island of Crete, and an Air Force
electronic listening post at Gournes, also on Crete.
   The United States pays Greece more than $430 million a year in
military credits as a form of rent for use of the bases.
   The government of Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou has been
under heavy pressure to remove the bases, and the pressure is likely
to increase during the campaign for elections in June.

<TEXT>
   A jury deliberated Friday for the second
day in the tax and mail fraud conspiracy trial of political maverick
Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
   When they left for lunch at mid-day, the eight women and four men
had debated the complex case against LaRouche and six associates for
eight hours beginning Thursday.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. has said they
should be prepared to work through Saturday if necessary to decide
all 48 counts involved.
   LaRouche, 66, a perennial independent presidential candidate, and
the six aides were charged with mail fraud and conspiracy for
allegedly raising more than $30 million in loans from supporters
without any intention of repaying them.
   LaRouche was charged separately with conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses paid by
various corporations he controls and claiming he had no taxable
income.
   LaRouche has not filed federal income tax returns for any year
since 1978, government prosecutors say. If convicted of all 13
counts against him, LaRouche faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in
prison and $3.25 million in fines.
   The six other defendants, who face lesser penalties if convicted,
are William Wertz, who was in charge of fund raising for LaRouche;
Edward Spannaus, LaRouche's legal coordinator, and fund-raisers
Michael Billington, Paul Greenberg, Joyce Rubinstein and Dennis
Small.
   LaRouche did not testify in his own defense during the 15-day
trial.
   Defense lawyers said LaRouche and the others were innocent of all
charges. They said the loans were solicited with good-faith
assurances that they would be repaid.
   Government prosecutors countered that everybody in the LaRouche
organization knew that they were part of a ``bankruptcy waiting to
happen'' and lied when they told prospective lenders that the terms
of the loans would be honored.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson told the jurors that
LaRouche and his followers had perpetrated ``an enormous crime _ a
$30 million crime.'' LaRouche's chief lawyer, Odin Anderson of
Boston, said the government was charging a ``voodoo conspiracy''
without any evidence to support its allegations.

   Major differences remain in negotiations over
the leases on U.S. military bases in Greece, which expire next week,
the State Department said Friday.
   The latest round of talks, which have been going on since
November 1987, was completed Friday and another session was
scheduled for January, said spokesman Charles Redman.
   But Redman said that if the negotiations fail, the bases would
have to close 17 months from the Dec. 20 expiration date.
   ``Important differences remain on many issues, but the
negotiators are not at an impasse,'' said Redman.
   ``Both sides right now indicate that it is our intention to try
to work together to reach a mutually agreeable decision to
continue,'' he added.
   The biggest bone of contention is the Hellenikon Air Force base
outside Athens, which is a particular irritant to Greek nationalists
resentful of the U.S. presence in their country.
   Greece announced in September that it would close down the
facility once the lease expires, but the United States contends the
Hellenikon base is part of the overall negotiations which have yet
to be resolved.
   About 1,400 servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700 Greeks
work at the base, opened in the late 1940s to help distribute
Marshal Plan aid to the war-torn country.
   Nationalists have urged Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou to eject
the United States, and the pressure on him is likely to mount during
the campaign for June elections.
   Three other U.S. bases have been operating in Greece since the
early 1950s _ a navy communications station near Athens, a 6th Fleet
supply base at Souda Bay in Crete and an Air Force electronic
listening post at Gournes, also on Crete.
   The United States pays the Greek government more than $430
million a year in credit for military armaments as a form of rent
for the bases, and for some 20 additional communications posts in
Greece.
   A statement issued in Athens said any new agreement would have to
serve Greece's ``highest national interests'' and would have to be
approved in a national referendum.
   Greece wants a new accord to guarantee U.S. help in solving some
of its longstanding disputes with neighboring Turkey.
   The two NATO allies are at odds over military control of the

Mediterranean island of Cyprus.

   Despite large November increases for gasoline
and heating oil, wholesale prices continue to rise at an annual rate
of less than 4 percent, the government said Friday, confounding
predictions of a mounting inflation problem.
   Wholesale prices edged up just 0.3 percent in November as food
costs at the wholesale level showed no increases for the second
straight month, the Labor Department said.
   The November increase, if it persisted for 12 months, would
amount to an annual inflation rate of just 3.3 percent, lower than
the 3.8 percent annualized rate for the first 11 months of 1987.
   ``Inflationary fears exceed inflationary reality at the present
time,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at
Georgia State University in Atlanta.
   Those fears were aggravated earlier this week when the government
reported that industrial production rose another half a percentage
point in November and that factories were operating at a nine-year
high of 84.2 percent of their capacity.
   Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of
Wholesalers-Distributors, said he sees no indication from the
association's 45,000 member companies that they are building
inventories in anticipation of future price spikes.
   Van Dongen called the inflationary fears a ``manifestation of
tribal rites in Washington and on the New York financial circuits''
with the changing of presidential administrations.
   ``Let's keep the debate a little bit honest,'' he said. ``I don't
see an inflationary psychology taking root, but Washington can talk
itself into all sorts of things. There's a lot of speculation
swirling around about policy, the Federal Reserve, what a new
administration is going to do.''
   Gasoline prices rose 3.4 percent and home heating oil skyrocketed
12.2 percent despite a 0.5 percent drop in crude oil prices. Natural
gas prices, however, fell 2.5 percent, sending overall energy prices
up just 1.2 percent. Heating oil prices had fallen 10 percent the
previous month.
   ``Even with the big spikes in energy, there just isn't a whole
lot of inflation out there,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist for
the Futures Group, a Washington consulting group. ``To have that,
you have to find things that become chronic, and you just don't see
that anywhere.''
   Ratajczak said the gasoline and heating oil price increases may
be partly due to the establishment of new production quotas last
month by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``Oil prices probably will end this year slightly higher than
originally expected because of response to the latest OPEC
agreement,'' Ratajczak said.
   However, he added that the OPEC agreement will become
``unmanageable'' by by next spring and prices will fall again,
moderating price increases for chemcials and plastics as well.
   Food prices, which the summer drought had pushed up at an annual
rate of 8 percent, showed no overall change last month after falling
0.1 percent in October.
   Prices for fresh fruits jumped 9.4 percent, while those for
canned fruits and vegetables gained 1.1 percent.
   Pork and beef prices each dropped by about half a percentage
point. Large declines also were recorded for a wide variety of other
food items, with egg prices off 14.5 percent, rice down 2.7 percent,
pasta products off 4.7 percent, chickens off 7.4 percent, turkeys
down 4.1 percent and coffee off 2.9 percent.
   Grocery shoppers can expect even better news in the months ahead.
The Labor Department's price index for crude foodstuffs such as
grains and livestock fell 6 percent in November, the largest monthly
drop since June 1974.
   Finished goods other than food and energy posted a 0.3 percent
gain, the same as the overall rate. Price gains accelerated,
however, for prescription drugs, detergents, books and newspapers.
   After falling a month earlier, prices turned upward for household
appliances, over-the-counter drugs, jewelry and sporting goods.
   Wholesale automobile prices were off 0.1 percent after a 1.7
percent decline in October. Capital equipment costs rose 0.3
percent, erasing a decline of the same magnitude in October.
   ``In the increasing concern about inflation, many have failed to
note that industrial commodity prices have increased less in 1988
than in 1987,'' Ratajczak said.
   The overall November increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 109.7, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $109.70 last month, 40
cents more than in October.

<HEAD>Expelled Priest Remains In Haiti and Ponders Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ An activist priest expelled from his
religious order for being a ``destabilizing'' influence in Haiti is
in excellent spirits and contemplating a future outside the
priesthood, friends said Friday.
   On Thursday, the Salesian order in Rome expelled the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide after he ignored an order to move from Haiti
to Canada by Oct. 17.
   ``His morale is excellent, excellent,'' said Paul Dejean, a
social worker and close friend of Aristide. ``He is going to take a
few days off now for meditation to decide on what steps to take
next.''
   Aristide, 35, has been the target of at least three assassination
attempts. On Sept. 11, while he was celebrating Mass, his St. Jean
Bosco church was attacked and burned down by armed thugs. At least
12 worshipers were killed and 70 wounded. Some died trying to shield
Aristide.
   In its communique Thursday, the Salesian Society accused Aristide
of being a ``destabilizing'' influence who instigates violence and
exalts class warfare.
   The most popular priest in Haiti, the bespectacled, charismatic
Aristide is called ``the prophet'' by his followers.
   In his impassioned and popular sermons, Aristide never explicitly
called for armed uprising, but he advocates ``active non-violence''
as a means for impoverished Haitians to achieve social justice.
   As a follower of liberation theology, Aristide also believes the
Church should play an active role in society.
   ``Aristide is not a radical. He preaches what every priest should
preach: the condemnation of oppression,''' said Jean-Claude Bajeaux,
director of Haiti's Ecumenical Center for Human Rights.
   The expulsion did not change Aristide's status as a priest, and
he could go to another diocese. The Rev. Jacques Mesidor, Aristide's
superior in Haiti, said the priest might dedicate himself to running
the charity organization The Family is Life, which he founded.
   ``The decision of the congregation will permit Rev. Aristide to
have his full liberty. He will not be bound by his obedience to a
religious community,'' Mesidor said.
   As a seminary student and then as a priest, Aristide has been
with the Salesians for 20 years. The order was founded by St. Jean
Bosco in Turin, Italy, in the 19th century and is chiefly dedicated
to education.
   The Salesians ordered Aristide to transfer to Canada by Oct. 17,
setting off a wave of demonstrations in Haiti. Aristide never obeyed.
   Aristide has called for an uprooting of remaining loyalists of
the former regime of Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to exile in
France in 1986.
   The massacre at his church provoked presidential guardsmen to
overthrow the military regime of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17
and to replace him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.

   Kentucky's Supreme Court has thrown out a
judge's ruling that required a woman to allow her two children to
visit their father, who is in prison for shooting her.
   The court said Jefferson Circuit Judge John Potter was wrong when
he granted limited visitation rights to Gary Owen Gooch, who was
sentenced to 20 years for ambushing his wife, Edith, outside the
bank where she worked on Sept. 25, 1985.
   Potter had ruled that a parent is entitled to visitation even if
it is harmful to the child, but the high court said that ruling was
``a misstatement of the law.''
   Edith Vice, who now uses her maiden name, said she was thrilled
by the unanimous decision Thursday.
   ``It's the end of a nightmare that I've had since September
1985,'' she said. ``To think we don't have this cloud hanging over
us any more _ the euphoria is incredible.''
   Gooch, 37, is being held at the Marion Adjustment Center in St.
Mary. His attorney, Julie Gregory, said she was considering her
client's options but would not discuss them.
   ``I feel an injustice has been done,'' she said.
   Ms. Vice has not had to allow Alex, 6, and Amanda, 5, to see
their father since Potter's ruling.

<HEAD>Europeans OK Treaty Limiting Ozone-Destroying Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight European countries and the European
Economic Community told the United Nations on Friday they have
ratified a treaty limiting the production of ozone-destroying
chemicals, ensuring that the treaty will go into effect Jan. 1.
   The 1987 treaty calls for signatory nations to reduce
``consumption,'' defined as production plus imports and minus
exports, to 1986 levels by July 1 of next year.
   A 20 percent cut must be in place in 1992 and a further 30
percent cut in 1998.
   The chemicals affected are the chlorofluorocarbon or CFC
compounds, practically indestructible refrigeration fluids,
foam-blowing agents, cleaning solvents and, outside North America
and Scandinavia, aerosol propellants. They have found wide use
because they are non-toxic and do not burn.
   A related set of bromine compounds, the halons used for
fire-fighting, are to be frozen at 1986 levels in 1992.
   The July 1 reduction will represent a sizable cut in actual
usage. Figures kept by the U.S. International Trade Commission
showed a 12.6 percent increase for 1987 compared with 1986 in
production of the two most common chemicals in question, and most
observers expect 1988 production to increase again.
   These chemicals can last for a century and more in the
atmosphere, rising slowly to the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles high
where their chlorine atoms are liberated to destroy ozone. Ozone
protects the Earth's surface from the harmful ultraviolet rays of
the sun.
   Scientists blame such chlorine for the annual October ``hole'' in
ozone over Antarctica, which some years sees high-altitude ozone
fall by 50 percent, and a decline in ozone over mid-latitudes of up
to 3 percent since about 1960.
   Each percent decline in ozone can represent a 4 percent to 6
percent increase in skin cancer, according to the Envronmental
Protection Agency.
   These effects have led EPA and many scientists to call for
revision of the treaty to ban these chemicals altogether, and
several major manufacturers have said they will end all production.
A scientific review called for by the treaty is under way, but the
earliest the signatory nations could consider it under procedures
now in force is April 1990.
   The treaty terms called for it to go into effect when ratified by
at least 11 countries representing two-thirds of world consumption.
Although 15 countries with a majority of world consumption had
ratified before Friday, they did not make the two-thirds mark.
   With Friday's ratifications, ``It's certainly well above
two-thirds,'' said Martine Coursil of the United Nations Environment
Program in New York. But she did not have the exact share of
consumption represented by the ratifications.
   In addition to the European Economic Community, these countries
notified the United Nations of ratification Friday: Britain,
Denmark, West Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and
Spain.
   According to Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that
has kept track of ratifications, the pact was ratified earlier by:
   Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Canada, Egypt, Japan,
Kenya, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Portugal,
Sweden, Uganda, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   Twenty-two other countries have signed the treaty but not yet
informed the United Nations of ratification. The only major
industrialized country in this group is France.
   ``It's a significant achievement, and it will be even more
meaningful once the agreement is strengthened,'' said Liz Cook of
Friends of the Earth.

   A Swiss delegate serving with the
International Committee of the Red Cross was released Friday from a
month in captivity, a local radio station said.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon interrupted its
programs to report that Peter Winkler was freed. The station,
quoting security sources for its brief report, did not say when or
where Winkler was set free.
   There was no immediate confirmation of his release.
   Spokesmen for the Red Cross headquarters in Beirut declined to
comment on the radio report.
   Winkler, 32, led Red Cross operations for south Lebanon from the
port city of Sidon, where he was snatched by gunmen Nov. 17. No
group has claimed reponsibility for Winkler's abduction.
   Red Cross officials have been in continuous contact with Lebanese
and Palestinian factions in a bid to gain Winkler's release.
   Earlier Friday the Red Cross addressed an open letter to Winkler
and said it will not rest until he gains his freedom.
   ``We would like you to know that we are here and we are exerting
all our energies and efforts to obtain your release,'' said the Red
Cross letter sent to Beirut newspapers for publication on Saturday
to mark Winkler's first month in captivity.
   ``These efforts shall not cease until the day you are back with
us,'' the letter said.
   Fourteen foreign hostages, including nine Americans, were
kidnapped and are believed held in Lebanon. The longest held is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press.

   An abused 9-year-old boy was recovering from
beating injuries Friday as his mother and her boyfriend awaited
arraignment on murder charges in the death of the boy's 5-year-old
stepsister, authorities said.
   Meanwhile, city officials denied assertions by the girl's family
that reports of child abuse had been filed with the city's Bureau of
Child Welfare.
   Nicky Lebron Alvarez was in serious but stable condition at
Woodhull Hospital, where he was brought Thursday after police found
him cowering in a closet in his family's Brooklyn apartment, said
hospital spokeswoman Maria Reyes.
   ``He was undernourished, beaten, marked and very scared,'' said
Deputy Chief Ronald Fenrich, head of Brooklyn detectives.
   The hospital spokeswoman said she could not reveal the boy's
injuries. The couple has not been charged in his case.
   On Wednesday, the boy's stepsister, Jessica Cortez, died of a
beating allegedly inflicted by their mother, Abigail Cortez, 25, and
the woman's boyfriend, Adrian Lopez, 25.
   The girl was discovered Wednesday night by Housing Authority
police summoned by a neighbor who heard screams coming from the
apartment. She was pronounced dead an hour later at a hospital.
   The girl was bruised from head to toe, had a broken left arm, a
possible skull fracture and a 2-inch open wound on her lip, said
Fenrich. She had also been sexually abused before her death, he said.
   As the couple left a police station Thursday after their arrests,
Ms. Cortez shouted to reporters, ``He did it! He did it all the way!
... I'm going to fight this.''
   Lopez had been living with the family for about a year, police
said.
   The dead girl's grandmother and aunt said they had complained
about mistreatment of the 5-year-old, but Human Resources
Administration spokeswoman Suzanne Trazoff said a check of files
showed no such information.
   Authorities confirmed a Bureau of Child Welfafe investigation had
taken place at the home about 18 months ago, when Jessica's father,
Carlos Cortez, was arrested on a murder charge. At that point, no
problems were cited.
   A 1-year-old girl belonging to the couple was turned over to the
bureau, Trazoff said. Two of Ms. Cortez's other children are living
with their maternal grandmother in Puerto Rico.

   He drops wads of cash and even lets his
handgun slip at times, but the robber federal agents dub ``Fumbles''
remains free after committing as many as 30 bank heists in Florida
in four years.
   The latest robbery occurred Wednesday, when a tall man in a
baseball cap, cotton gloves and sunglasses stuck up the Beneficial
Savings Bank.
   The 6-foot-2-inch robber left quickly with an undisclosed amount
of money, and once again nobody knows whether the getaway was on
foot or by car.
   ``He appears to stay outside and wait until it's rather quiet,''
Dunedin police Detective John Brown said Thursday. His department
suspects the man in two bank heists this year.
   ``I don't think anybody that robs a bank can do it without being
caught,'' Tampa FBI spokesman Larry Curtin said. ``But he's been
successful for over three years. I don't know why.''
   The bandit dons the cap, sunglasses and gloves. Then, armed with
a handgun, he walks inside and heads straight to a teller's window.
He demands money and grabs whatever he can.
   He doesn't bother to make employees remove money from vaults
because that is time consuming, detectives say. There have been no
reports of injuries in the robberies, according to the FBI.

   American Jewish leaders say the co-chairman of
a Soviet committee which generated anti-Israel propaganda has told
them the state-sponsored panel will be dismantled by the end of the
year.
   The decision to disband the Soviet Anti-Zionist Committee
reflects recent improvement in relations between the Soviet Union
and Israel, as well as better treatment of Jews wishing to emigrate.
   A letter purportedly written by Samuel Zivs, a Soviet lawyer who
was one of the founders of the panel in 1983, was sent to prominent
Jewish leaders in New York. A copy of the letter, dated Nov. 14, was
obtained by The Associated Press on condition that the people to
whom it was addressed were not identified.
   A Soviet Embassy spokesman, Boris Malakhov, said Friday he did
not know about a decision to disband the committee, ``although I do
not exclude it is possible.''
   After saying the panel would be terminated, Zivs added that he
was ``sincerely committed and excited about'' working with the
Jewish community in the United States and in his own country.
   Jewish leaders from the United States had urged that the
committee be disbanded, saying it was anti-Semitic as well as
anti-Zionist. Zivs said in the letter that the panel's activities
``were never intended to be, contrary to how they have unfortunately
been perceived, anti-Semitic.''
   The committee, composed of Jews with close links to the
government, was formed in a bid to dissuade Jewish dissidents from
seeking permits to leave their country for Israel and to discredit
their attempts in the eyes of the West. It is headed by David
Dragunsky, a retired three-star general.
   At a news conference in June 1983, eight committee leaders said
Zionism is a ``racist ideology'' akin to the anti-Semitic dogma
espoused by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Zionism is an ideology which
supports Israel as a homeland for the Jews.
   The committee also announced that emigration levels would remain
at their low ebb because most Jews who had wanted to leave had
already done so. The number of exit visas had been dropping
progressively from an all-time high of 51,320 reached in 1979,
hitting a record low of less than 1,000 in 1986.
   With the advent of a more liberal and open policy instituted by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, emigration has again risen to
16,572 through November, nearly doubling the 1987 figures.
   Israel and the Soviet Union this year exchanged consular
delegations for the first time since the Soviets broke ties in 1967.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-seven workers from a capsized
oil rig spent a day in high seas huddled inside a survival capsule
the size of a large van before they were rescued Friday by Canada's
coast guard.
   ``All 27 are reported to be in good medical shape, not requiring
any medical attention,'' said Dick Pepper, spokesman for the coast
guard.
   Pepper said the 25 men and two women workers from the Rowan
Gorilla I oil rig were taken from the enclosed capsule to the
tugboat Smit London in a motorized rubber raft after the stormy seas
calmed enough to permit a rescue.
   The winds and waves up to 40 feet high prevented an earlier
rescue from the capsule, which can remain afloat for days and hold
as many as 50 people.
   The offshore rig overturned Thursday about 1,200 miles east of
New York City. The Rescue Coordination Center at Halifax, more than
600 miles to the northwest, organized the rescue.
   Maj. Glen Urquhart said 25 Canadians, one American and a Dutch
crew member were released.
   The crew members entered the survival pod about noon Thursday,
before the rig overturned. The rig, owned by the Rowan Co. Inc. of
Houston, was last sighted Thursday afternoon and it was not clear if
it sank in the storm.
   Tim Brownlow, a crew member who was not on the rig, said the life
pod has enough food and water for days and can stay afloat in the
roughest weather.
   ``Have you ever put a cork in a bathtub? That's what it's like,''
he said. ``They're a self-righting capsule. They can flip, flip,
flip and it will keep righting itself.''
   The rig began listing after one of its ballast tanks cracked and
began taking in water, said Danny McNease, vice president of
operations for the Rowan Co. He said the rig, 300 feet wide and 300
feet long, was built to withstand 100-foot waves and 80 mph winds.
   The rig, which is not under lease to an oil company, left Halifax
last week for the 30-day trip across the Atlantic to the North Sea.
It can carry 86 crew members. It is a jack-up rig, meaning its
platform sits atop huge legs that are embedded in the sea floor
during drilling.
   Anxious relatives waiting in Halifax for word about the crew.
   Jane Grijm, whose 44-year-old husband Richard was the rig's cook,
said she planned to ask him to quit such work, as she has for four
years.
   ``But Richard doesn't get too scared, and I am praying and having
this good stiff drink too,'' she told the Toronto Star.

<HEAD>VA Raising Rate Half Point to 10.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration said Friday it was
raising its maximum interest rate for federally backed VA home
mortgages by one-half percentage point to 10.5 percent.
   VA spokeswoman Pam Siciliano said the agency was making the
change, which will take effect Monday, to reflect recent increases
in interest rates in financial markets.
   The latest change is the fifth in 1988. The low for the year was
9.5 percent on Feb. 1. The rate rose to 10 percent on April 4 and to
10.5 percent on May 23. On Nov. 1, it was cut to 10 percent.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac,
said Friday that the national average for 30-year, conventional
mortgages _ those without government guarantees _ rose to 10.71
percent this week from 10.46 percent last week. It matched the
highest rate for the year so far, also 10.71 percent, during the
week ended Aug. 19.
   Freddie Mac said the average rate on one-year, adjustable-rate
mortgages was 8.43 percent this week, up from 8.35 percent the
previous week. It was the highest average since the week ended Oct.
16, 1987, just before the stock market crash.
   The VA said that effective Monday a variety of other mortgage
rates will also rise by one-half percentage point. Graduated payment
mortgages will increase to 10.75 percent, home improvement loans
will rise to 12 percent and loans for mobile homes will increase to
13 percent.
   The VA rates apply to new loans, not existing ones. VA mortgages
peaked at 17.5 percent in September 1981 before beginning a decline
and reaching a low for this decade of 8.5 percent in January 1987.
   In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the VA guaranteed 232,638
loans amounting to $17.3 billion.

   The B-2 stealth bomber recently unveiled by the
Air Force will cost $516 million per plane, making it the most
expensive aircraft ever built, the secretary of the Air Force said
today.
   The secretary, Edward C. Aldridge, told a news conference the
design, development and construction of 132 of the planes is
expected to cost $68.1 billion by the time production ends in
mid-1995.
   The pricetag has grown from $36.6 billion to $42.5 billion in
fiscal 1981 dollars _ an increase of about 16 percent, Aldridge said.
   Subtracting the cost of research and development, which is about
a third of the total cost, the actual production cost of the
long-range bomber amounts to $305 million per plane, he said.
   The B-2 is called stealth because it is designed to be extremely
difficult for radar to detect.

   Israel refused an Arab-American leader
permission to enter the country Friday because of ``a long record of
anti-Israeli activities.''
   Abdeen Jabara, born in the United States, arrived from New York
via Paris on a Pan Am flight and was told of the decision by police
at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv. He is president of the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee based in Washington.
   Alon Liel, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the objectionable
activities included acting as a defense lawyer for Palestinians held
in the United States for alleged terrorist attacks in Israel.
   He said Jabara also had criticized Israel and demanded that Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir be barred from the United States.
   Jabara told reporters: ``This is an unconscionable act. I am not
an enemy of the state. I have been here at least 15 times before,
and this is a violation of our treaty agreement.''
   In Washington, former Sen. James Abourezk, chairman of the
American-Arab committee, said: ``He has been singled out because of
his political views, views which happen to be shared by many Israeli
and American citizens. It is not a coincidence that this outrageous
action occurred just two days after our government announced that it
would begin talks with the PLO.''
   Police said Jabara would be given a room for the night and put on
the return Pan Am flight Saturday morning.
   Sandra Campbell, a U.S. Embassy official, met Jabara at the
airport. She said the embassy was told in advance he would not be
allowed to enter and American diplomats discussed the situation with
Israeli officials.
   She would not give details.
   Liel said the decision was made by the Interior Ministry, which
is responsible for passport control and immigration, and approved by
the Foreign Ministry. ``We decided, after seeing the record, to back
the decision.''
   Jabara's committee claims to have more than 23,000 Arab-Americans
as members. Earlier this year, the group opened a chapter in Arab
east Jerusalem to represent about 8,000 Palestinian Americans living
in the Israeli-occupied territories, most of them in the West Bank.
   People who attended the group's first meeting in Jerusalem in
June claimed they were harassed at the Israel border and subjected
to demeaning searches. Israeli officials denied the allegations.
   An official of the local chapter said privately the Israelis may
have been displeased with the committee's activities, which include
arranging visits to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip by aides
to U.S. congressmen.

   The Federal Election Commission on Friday
selected Democratic Commissioner Danny McDonald as its chairman for
the coming year.
   McDonald was appointed to the regulatory panel in 1981 and served
as chairman in 1983. He succeeds Thomas Josefiak, who retains his
seat on the six-member commission. Commissioner Lee Ann Elliott was
selected vice chairman.
   FEC members are presidential appointees, serving six-year terms,
with three Democrats and three Republicans serving at any one time.
   McDonald formerly was general administrator of the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission and secretary and chief clerk of the Tulsa
County Election Board.
   The FEC is charged with regulating the federal election process,
including all congressional and presidential campaigns. The panel
enforces the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 which governs
limitations on campaign contributions and spending and requires
public disclosure of campaign finances.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of
Dec. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.98 million head,
down 5 percent from a year ago but 2 percent more than inventories
of two years ago, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.68 million head, up 4 percent from a year
ago but down 8 percent from two years ago.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in November totaled 1.51 million
head, up 3 percent from a year ago and up 4 percent from two years
ago.
   As of Dec. 1, feedlot inventories were smaller than a year
earlier in Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas. But
California showed an increase and Iowa was unchanged. The seven
states produce about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of Dec. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

   Northwest Airlines said in federal court Friday
that it would accept liability in the August 1987 jet crash that
killed 156 people if families of victims agree to drop demands for
punitive damages.
   Lawyers for the families of 121 victims, who are suing the
airline, announced the possible agreement in a federal court hearing.
   Attorney Lee Kriendler, a member of the committee coordinating
the families' cases, said the airline may make such offers to
plaintiffs who agree to seek only compensatory damages. Those are
damages a jury awards to compensate a plaintiff for lost
companionship, wages and the like. Punitive damages are awarded by a
jury to punish a defendant.
   An attorney for the airline, Carroll Dubuc, said only that the
airline has agreed to consider such offers under certain conditions
on a case-by-case basis.
   U.S. District Judge Julian Cook said he would read the sealed
agreement and question attorneys on the terms.
   Kriendler said such agreements could make it possible to try
compensatory damage cases as early as March and wrap up much of the
litigation within the next year.
   The Aug. 16, 1987, crash of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport was the second-deadliest in the
nation's history, behind the May 1979 American Airlines DC-10 crash
at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport that killed 275 people.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edwina Currie, a controversial deputy health
minister rated the best-known politician in Britain after Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, resigned Friday in a national crisis
over a salmonella scare.
   Mrs. Currie, 42, caused the furor Dec. 3 when she said most
British eggs were tainted with salmonella, a bacteria that causes
food poisoning that in rare cases is fatal.
   The government launched a $925,000 advertising campaign Friday to
try to make Britons buy eggs again and announced plans to bail out
producers by spending millions more to buy unsold eggs piling up at
farms and warehouses.
   Earlier Friday, egg producers filed multimillion-dollar damage
claims against Mrs. Currie.
   ``I think in all the circumstances it (resignation) is the best
course,'' Mrs. Currie said in a letter to Mrs. Thatcher after a
private meeting at the prime minister's 10 Downing St. residence.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who provided some defense for Mrs. Currie as the
uproar over the egg scare built through two weeks, said she accepted
the resignation ``with great personal sadness.''
   ``We shall miss the great energy and enthusiasm you have brought
to all your work,'' she said in a reply letter.
   But it remained uncertain just how risky Britain's eggs are.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who in one parliamentary exchange last week
announced she'd had an egg for breakfast, reported Thursday that 49
outbreaks of salmonella from eggs had affected 49,000 people.
   Appearing to back Mrs. Currie, she acknowledged that many other
cases probably went unreported.
   Producers say egg consumption, normally 200 million a week or
four per person, has slumped by as much as 60 percent since Mrs.
Currie's warning.
   Mrs. Currie was the most headline-grabbing member of the
Conservative government.
   Since being elected to Parliament five years ago, she has become
noted for down-to-earth, colorfully phrased advice on health care,
eating habits and life styles.
   This year, Mrs. Currie advised retirees to mortgage their homes
to pay for private health care and told the old to don ``woolly
night-caps'' to ward off winter cold.
   A poll in September in the respected weekly Economist showed Mrs.
Currie's face was the most instantly recognizable in the government
after Mrs. Thatcher's.
   Egg producers expressed delight at Mrs. Currie's resignation. The
opposition Labor Party said she'd been fired and deserved it, but
added she'd be missed.
   Government ads in national newspapers Friday said the incidence
of salmonella is ``very small.'' But the advertisements also advised
against uncooked eggs in homemade mayonnaise and Yuletide eggnog,
and it prescribed hard-boiled eggs for the sick, elderly, infants or
expectant mothers.
   ``This woman with her outrageous statement has caused us
tremendous damage,'' said John Coles, managing director of Thames
Valley Eggs Ltd., the first producer to institute legal proceedings
against Mrs. Currie. ``We have lost tens of millions of pounds.''
   But he said the government's advertising campaign would help ``in
no way'' because it mentions the salmonella risk.
   Mrs. Currie, born and raised in a working-class family in the
northwest England port of Liverpool, is a right-wing Conservative in
the Thatcher mold.
   But unlike Mrs. Thatcher, she discusses her views frankly on
everything from politics, health and sex to her personal life,
including her two daughters and the refusal of her Orthodox Jewish
father ever to see her again after she married a gentile.

<HEAD>Explorer Searches for Tea Party Crates on Boston Harbor Floor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exactly 215 years after revolutionary patriots
dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor to protest colonial
tyranny, an explorer launched an effort to retrieve them.
   Barry Clifford, a salvage entrepreneur who located the first
pirate ship in the New World four years ago, stood on the docks of
Boston Harbor in below-freezing temperatures Friday, gesturing
across a channel as divers prepared to jump into the icy waters.
   ``It was a cold night, the winds were coming from the northwest
and the tide was coming in,'' said Clifford, referring to the
evening of Dec. 16, 1773, when 30 patriots, angered over King George
III's three-penny tax on a pound of tea, raided three ships and
dumped the tea overboard.
   Clifford hopes to bring back about 40 or 50 of the wooden chests
and place them in a museum with some of the $40 million in artifacts
he found on the wreck of the pirate ship Whydah in 1984.
   He is not bothered by criticism that he may be disturbing
historical sites or the skepticism voiced by museum officials about
whether the tea chests are still intact after two centuries
underwater.
   ``We've left this alone for more than 200 years,'' Clifford said.
``Boston Harbor is one of the greatest archaeological resources we
have. We've already gotten letters from schoolchildren around the
country. It's good when something like this focuses attention on a
historical event.''
   Though the actual site where the tea was dumped, Griffin's Wharf,
now lies 150 yards inland under a Boston Edison substation, Clifford
said he believes tides would have moved the chests into the Fort
Point area. He said most of the crates were simple wooden boxes
except for about 50 that were of an ornate Chinese design.
   Using a chartered lobster boat, Clifford and a crew of five
motored to the middle of Fort Point Channel, an area of the harbor
located between downtown and South Boston.
   Three divers wearing dry suits and thermal underwear prepared to
dive 35 feet into the water searching for signs of the crates.
Clifford also directed electronic searches of the area using
sidescan sonar and sidebottom profiling machines.
   Clifford said he got the idea to look for the Tea Party chests
from an unlikely source: President-elect George Bush.
   ``I was driving along one day listening to George Bush talk about
the pollution in Boston Harbor,'' said Clifford. ``But it came to me
all of a sudden how we should go look for the chests. No one has
ever looked at Boston Harbor before.''
   Friday's search was the first step in what Clifford said could be
a project that takes years. Though Clifford has informal permission
from state officials to scan areas of the harbor, he has been turned
down in his bid for exclusive rights to survey a nautical square
mile.
   This month the state Board of Archaelogical Resources told
Clifford that he must first retrieve artifacts from the site that
are at least 100 years old. Clifford plans to go before the board
again after locating artifacts and hopes to apply again for a permit
giving him exclusive rights to search the area.
   Last week the state Supreme Court ruled that Clifford could keep
gold, silver, cannons and other artifacts from the Whydah. In an
unanimous opinion, the high court rejected the state's claim of
sovereignty over the Whydah, which foundered off Cape Cod in April
1717.

<HEAD>Reduced Tobacco Supply Translates Into Higher Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reduced supply of tobacco is translating into
higher prices for farmers this year, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   The 1988 crop was larger but failed to offset a decline in U.S.
inventories prior to the new harvest.
   ``Tighter supplies and the generally better quality 1988 crop
have boosted prices of virtually every type of tobacco this
season,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
   The flue-cured crop averaged $1.61 per pound, up 2 cents from
last year. And with larger marketings, cash receipts of flue-cured
producers were up about 16 percent, the agency said in its latest
outlook report.
   Prices were up because of ``a tighter supply-demand balance, a
better quality crop and higher support prices,'' the report said.
   ``Burley sales began Nov. 21, with prices averaging about 4 cents
a pound higher than a year earlier,'' the report said. ``Burley
supports were increase 1.2 cents a pound this season.''
   U.S. cigarette consumption in calendar 1988 may be down about 2
percent from last year, although total output is larger to meet an
increase in export demand, the report said.

<TEXT>
   For 19-year-old Patrina Thomas, gaining
custody of three brothers and a sister will make this Christmas
special.
   The Thomas children lost their mother to a heart attack in 1987,
and their father abandoned them this spring when he was arrested on
a drug charge.
   Ms. Thomas has been taking care of the younger children since
then by working at a Jacksonville day-care center and supplementing
her income with welfare, food stamps and housing assistance.
   On Thursday she was awarded custody of Larry, 17, Monique, 13,
Reggie, 12, and Derek, 8, in a Duval County Court proceeding.
   ``This is my Christmas present,'' said Ms. Thomas.
   After living in New York, Ms. Thomas' mother moved the children
to Mississippi a few years ago. When the mother became seriously
ill, their father, Larry Thomas, moved the children to Jacksonville.
   The mother died shortly after that.
   Ms. Thomas said her father, whom the Veterans Administration
considers to be disabled, got an increase in his benefits after
taking the children. But she said he spent the money on himself,
buying drugs.
   ``He had us since January of last year, but he hadn't been taking
care of us. He was spending the money on crack (cocaine),'' she said.
   The five Thomas children had been living in an apartment with
their father and his girlfriend. Ms. Thomas was forced to leave
after arguing with the girlfriend and moved in with a neighbor.
However, she still managed to give the younger children school lunch
money and groceries by working at a fast-food restaurant in the
evenings.
   In March, their father spent a month in the county jail for
cocaine possession and the girlfriend moved out. Neighbor Willie May
Ellis moved the children into her apartment until Ms. Thomas was
able to get a subsidized apartment.
   All the children are good students, and Reggie is president of
the teen council at the Teen Alliance Center. Nanelle Lowe, center
director, said the children are well-mannered and responsible.
   As for Ms. Thomas, ``she carries herself like an older, mature
woman,'' said Ms. Ellis. ``I have older friends who can't cope with
what she does.''
   Ms. Thomas, who graduated from high school in June, hopes to
become a nurse.
   ``I want an education more than anything else. I want them (her
brothers and sister) to go to college. I want to put them through
myself. I want them to grow up and be strong,'' she said.

   Kidnappers in this southern port released a
Swiss official of the International Red Cross on Friday after a
month of captivity, police reported.
   A police spokesman said Peter Winkler, 32, of the International
Committee of the Red Cross was freed at 9 p.m. (2 p.m. EST) at
Hisbeh Square, the same spot in Sidon where he was abducted Nov. 17.
   ``Mr. Winkler has been handed over to the ICRC and is now at the
ICRC center in Sidon,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be identified
under standing regulations. ``He is cleanshaven and looks fit, with
no sign of any physical torture or maltreatment.''
   He said the Nasserite leftist militia that has ruled Sidon since
the 1975 outbreak of Lebanon's civil war took delivery of Winkler.
   The former captive then was turned over to Eric N. Pfister, the
Swiss ambassador to Damascus, and Mohammed Bizri, the Lebanese
representative of the International Red Cross in Sidon, 25 miles
south of Beirut.
   ``Mr. Winkler wore the same clothes that he had on when he was
kidnapped,'' the spokesman said.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station in east
Beirut said Winkler was freed by the Fatah-Revolutionary Council,
the guerrilla group led by terrorist Abu Nidal.
   Winkler was among 15 foreigners known to be held captive in
Lebanon, including nine Americans. Held longest is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The State Department expressed concern Friday
over the ``very intense pattern of Soviet offensive activity'' in
Afghanistan, including air strikes on rebel positions that sometimes
exceed 100 per day.
   But department spokesman Charles Redman said he does not believe
the Soviet activities, which date back about seven weeks, mean the
Kremlin will renege on its promise to remove its forces from
Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   Redman said Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost very likely
raised the issue during a meeting Friday with Soviet Ambassador Yuri
Dubinin.
   ``We feel very strongly that this is not what needs to be done in
Afghanistan,'' Redman said.
   He added that the air strikes violate promises the Soviets made
to Washington at the time of the Soviet-American summit meeting a
year ago.
   The Soviets contend that withdrawing Soviet troops have been
attacked by Afghan rebels and that the United States and Pakistan
have acted in bad faith by continuing the flow of arms and
ammunition to the rebels.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of festive demonstrators marched
through Madrid on Friday night to demand a greater share of Spain's
economic prosperity for union workers, the unemployed and the
elderly.
   No incidents were reported as 40,000 cheering people crowded into
Puerta del Sol square for the march called by the the largest union,
the Socialist General Workers Union, and the communist-dominated
Workers Commissions.
   The same demands were the basis of a general strike called by the
unions on Wednesday that closed the nation's businesses and public
transportation.
   News reports said many other marchers had not yet reached the
square considered the geographical center of Spain.
   The marchers and the unions want Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's
Socialist government to share the fruits of an economic boom Spain
is enjoying.
   Antonio Gutierrez, secretary-general of the communist-led union,
told state television the march was ``the finishing touch on the
most important lesson in democracy the Spanish people have given for
some time.''
   Gonzalez called the general strike Wednesday, the first in Spain
in 54 years, ``a tough political blow'' to his 6-year-old government
and repeated his offer to talk with union and business leaders. Both
unions rejected the invitation unless the government first meets
five basic demands.
   These include broadening unemployment insurance to include up to
48 percent of Spain's 2.7 million jobless and boosting the smallest
retirement pensions to the monthly minimum wage of $400.
   Spain's 5 percent annual growth rate is the highest in Western
Europe and the country's banks quadrupled their profits this year.
   But it retains Europe's highest unemployment rate of 18.7 percent.
   Union leaders and rank-and-file say it was their agreement to
moderate wages that made the boom possible. They have threatened
more strikes if their demands are not met.
   State railroad engineers plan to strike Sunday, while the union
representing maintenance technicians of the national airline Iberia
said they would stay away from work on Dec. 23, 26, 30 and Jan. 2, 5
and 9.
   After the strike, 53 percent of the Spaniards polled by the
country's leading daily, El Pais, said they believe Gonzalez should
make concessions to the unions for the sake of social peace.
   On Jan. 1, Spain assumes the six-month rotating presidency of the
European Economic Community for the first time since it joined the
12-member trading bloc in 1986. Socialist leaders claim the labor
agitation is an embarrassment on the eve of the historic occasion.

   Soldiers killed four Palestinians in the
occupied territories Friday, one of the bloodiest days of the
year-old rebellion against Israeli rule. Arab doctors said 32 were
wounded.
   At least 328 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000
wounded since the uprising began in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which Israel has controlled since the 1967 war. Thirteen Israelis
also have been slain.
   Friday's violence was among the worst since April 16, when
soldiers killed 14 Palestinians during riots protesting the
assassination in Tunisia of Khalil Wazir, the PLO military commander
known as Abu Jihad.
   Israel denied entry Friday to Abdeen Jabara, a U.S. citizen and
president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee,
``because of his long record of anti-Israeli activities.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said the activities included
serving as a defense lawyer in U.S. courts for four Palestinians
accused of terror attacks in Israel and making statements against
Israel and Zionism.
   Jabara called the ban ``an unconscionable act'' and declared: ``I
am not an enemy of the state. I have been here at least 15 times
before.''
   A military court convicted an Israeli army private, Eli Yadid,
19, of killing a Palestinian in March with a rubber bullet to the
head and sentenced him to 21 months in prison, an army spokesman
said.
   He said Yadid violated army regulations by firing at ``very close
range'' when his life was not in danger.
   Black smoke from burning tires filled the air Friday in Nablus,
where the killings occurred, and Arab witnesses said the wail of
ambulance sirens was heard throughout city of 120,000, largest in
the West Bank. Soldiers imposed a curfew, barring journalists and
photographers.
   Residents went into the streets when word of the deaths spread.
They built dozens of roadblocks and hung black flags of mourning
from the roofs of houses.
   Confrontations between soldiers and young Palestinians were
inspired by the death Thursday night of Ashraf al Haj Daoud, 15, of
a gunshot wound in the chest suffered Nov. 25, according to doctors
at Anglican Hospital in Nablus.
   Nablus residents declared a general strike in protest and street
battles began during a funeral procession in the Ras el Ein
neighborhood, where the teen-ager lived, witnesses said.
   Dozens of masked youths carried the coffin, which was wrapped in
the outlawed Palestinian flag and draped with a checkered Arab
headdress, the witnesses reported. As they marched, many young men
waved Palestinian banners and chanted ``We will avenge your blood,
Daoud!''
   Some began hurling stones at soldiers who shot and killed two
Palestinians, and two more were killed when riots spread to other
areas, the reports said.
   Officials of Anglican Hospital identified three of the victims as
Yassin Sharshir, 21, shot in the head; Fayez Shaku, 20, hit in the
chest; and Iyad Abul Helal, 18, shot in the head and chest.
   Family members identified the fourth as Nidal Shafik, 26. They
said he was hit in the neck and chest.
   Doctors said 20 people were wounded in Nablus, four of them
critically. An army spokesman confirmed four killed and nine wounded.
   Soldiers wounded five Palestinians in villages near Tulkarem in
the West Bank, including a 9-year-old boy shot in the neck, Arab
witnesses said.
   Seven Palestinians, including five teen-agers, were wounded in
the Gaza Strip refugee camps of Rafah, Jabaliya and Nuseirat,
doctors reported.
   An aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the day's outburst
was evidence the United States should not have contacts with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, which began this week.
   ``This is the result of giving in to people of violence,'' Avi
Pazner said on Israel radio.

   The Federal Aviation Administration announced
Friday it will spend $100 million to build a new taxiway and apron
system at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, one of the
nation's busiest.
   The funds will be used in the airport's expansion of its west
side. Airport spokesman Joe Dealey said negotiations were under way
between the airport and American Airlines over building a terminal
on the west side.
   The bulk of airport traffic is now concentrated on the east side,
and the money will allow the airport to ``to operate more
efficiently and accommodate the projected growth,'' said FAA
spokesman John Leyden.
   The airport is the country's largest in size, and was the
third-busiest through the first 10 months of the year, with 564,000
takeoffs and landings.
   The FAA said it was signing a letter of intent to spend $12.5
million a year over eight years on the airport construction project,
beginning in fiscal year 1990.
   The grant represents the largest such commitment ``ever made, to
any airport, anywhere,'' Dealey said.
   Opened in 1974, the airport has 1,200 employees along with 25,000
workers of airlines and support industries, generating an estimated
$5.5 billion annually for the area economy.

   President George Sokomanu dissolved
parliament Friday and called elections for February, citing economic
problems and political violence, but Prime Minister Walter Lini
rejected the decision.
   He said Sokomanu was a ``political fool'' with no power to
dissolve the parliament of these South Pacific islands suggested the
president resign.
   Sokomanu's office is largely ceremonial, and he acknowledged to
an Australian news service he had no authority to dissolve
Parliament. He announced the dissolution after Lini's candidates
easily won by-elections this week.
   Barak Sope, a rival of Lini who challenged the prime minister's
leadership by urging a boycott of the by-elections, led a
demonstration outside Parliament on Friday despite a government ban
on protests.
   Roads leading to the capital were blocked and cars were searched
for weapons. Riot police manned barricades around Parliament and
most of central Vila was boarded up in case of violence.
   Sokomanu said he decided to act after paramilitary troops shot
and wounded a teen-age Australian tourist who drove through a
checkpoint Friday without stopping.
   The president said violence was hurting the economy. He did not
elaborate, but tourism provides most of Vanuatu's foreign exchange.
   The country, known as the tax haven of the South Pacific, has a
population of 130,000 and is 1,200 miles northeast of Brisbane,
Australia.

   U.S. and South Korean officials began
talks Friday on the future of U.S. bases here and on revising
agreements protecting 42,000 American troops stationed in South
Korea.
   South Koreans called for U.S. military facilities to be moved
from central Seoul to rural locations and for a revision of
regulations exempting American forces from local law.
   ``Both sides agreed to continue these kind of discussions on the
grounds that the reinforcement of the security relationship between
the two countries is important,'' a South Korean statement said
after the first session.
   A U.S. statement said, ``The discussions were held in an
atmosphere of friendly cooperation and were very useful to both
sides.''
   The meeting was organized for South Korea to express its concerns
and U.S. officials to study them. No date was set for the next
meeting.
   American officials already have indicated their willingness to
relocate the sprawling Yongsan base if South Korea provides
comparable facilities elsewhere. This would help reduce
anti-American sentiment among some South Koreans and open up prime
real estate in the capital.
   U.S. troops have been based here since 1950 to help defend South
Korea from North Korean attack. The communist North invaded the
South in 1950, touching off the Korean War.
   Talks are to center on the Status of Forces Agreement, a 1966
pact some critics want rewritten to give South Korea greater
jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers in criminal and other matters.
   Dissidents and radical students demand the immediate withdrawal
of American forces, which they contend hamper unification with North
Korea.
   But recent surveys show most South Koreans support the U.S.
presence as a deterrent to war on the divided Korean peninsula.
   In Seoul, the opposition-controlled National Assembly narrowly
approved President Roh Tae-woo's nomination of former Gen. Kang
Young-hoon as prime minister on Friday.
   The nomination was approved by 160 of 294 legislators, with
disapproving abstentions from 123 opposition lawmakers, 10 ``no''
votes and one invalid ballot.
   More than 70 members of the main opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy abstained, saying Roh violated the constitution in naming
Kang as premier this month and appointing 18 new Cabinet ministers
in a major reshuffle.
   Legal experts say Roh needs parliamentary approval first under a
new constitution adopted in a referendum last year.
   The nomination was approved only with the help of former Premier
Kim Jong-pil, whose moderate opposition New Democratic Republican
Party controls 35 seats.

<HEAD>DOE Says Savannah River Pipe Crack Was Due To Welding, Not Design
Flaw</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New material throughout to UPDATE with DOE spokesman saying
pipe crack isn't of major safety significance.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pipe crack found in the cooling system of a
reactor at the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant is a type of
defect that has cropped up previously and does not represent new
safety problems, a Department of Energy spokesman said Friday.
   Engineers at the weapons production facility near Aiken, S.C.,
have determined that the crack apparently resulted from heat due to
welding work on the pipe, DOE spokesman Gary Pitchford said.
   The Washington Post reported Friday that the crack at the plant's
L reactor appeared to be either a flaw or stress-induced defect in
the stainless steel pipe metal itself.
   An official whom the newspaper did not identify said the problem
was a ``potential show-stopper'' that could seriously delay
restarting the three reactors at the Savannah River Plant and
possibly require the L reactor to be shut down permanently.
   Pitchford, however, said ``we're now highly confident that what
we're seeing here is rather classical cracking ... intergranular
stress-corrosion cracking, which we have seen rather frequently in
sensitized metal'' near where welding has been done.
   ``It is a type of crack that we have seen before and does not, in
our view, represent a new phenomenon. We do not believe that the
cracking we have seen represents a major safety concern or a new
safety problem,'' said the spokesman, speaking by telephone from
DOE's Savannah River office.
   He added, ``The implication is we need to make improvements and
changes in our in-service inspection program, but it is not a new
type of cracking or representative of some new safety issue that we
have not encountered before.''
   All three reactors at Savannah River _ known as the K, L and P
reactors _ have been shut down due to maintenance and safety
concerns.
   The reactors are the nation's only sources of tritium, a
radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to boost the explosive power of
nuclear warheads. Because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a
year, it needs to be replenished regularly.
   DOE is seeking to restart by this summer the K reactor, which is
almost identical in design but older than the L reactor.
   Pitchford noted that ``cracks are not infrequently found in areas
associated with welds. It's caused by what they call the
heat-affected zone of the metal. The metal becomes sensitized, in
the parlance of the metallurgists.''
   Sections of pipe are removed and replaced if a crack is found
penetrating more than 50 percent of the pipe wall's thickness or
covering more than 20 percent of the pipe's circumference.
   As part of a regular inspection program, Pitchford said, ``a
crack was identified that met those criteria and a section of pipe
was removed from the L reactor in October 1987. The program called
for inspection of that pipe after removal. That was done in March
1988. ...
   ``They found cracks in an unexpected location, not associated
with the original weld which caused the pipe to be removed, but
associated with a structural support welded to the outside of the
pipe. There were a series of cracks on the interior surface of the
pipe in the heat-affected zone where that structural support had
been welded,'' Pitchford said.
   The crack at the focus of particular concern was found during
continued examination of the pipe, using ultrasonic testing and
other methods, he said.

<HEAD>Court Upholds NRC On Importing Nuclear Fuel From South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday upheld a
government decision allowing continued importation of a nuclear
power plant fuel from South Africa despite anti-apartheid sanctions
enacted by Congress.
   A split three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here ruled that the petitioners lacked legal standing to challenge
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's decision to allow continued
importation of uranium hexafluoride from South Africa.
   The NRC's 1987 decision was challenged by seven members of
Congress, four private organizations and two individuals, including
an unemployed uranium miner and an anti-apartheid activist.
   The petitioners had contended that the NRC failed to enforce the
anti-apartheid sanctions passed by Congress in 1986 that forbid
continued importation of South African uranium and uranium oxide.
   The NRC had decided that the sanction law did not ban uranium
hexafluoride, a gas that is used to power nuclear reactors.
   Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman wrote for the court. But Judge
Milton Pollack filed a concurring opinion to express his uneasiness
over whether legal standing should be the basis of the ruling.
   Judge Ruth Ginsburg, who dissented on the standing question, and
Pollack said they would uphold the NRC decision on the ground the
agency properly interpreted the anti-apartheid statute as allowing
continued importation of the radioactive chemical.
   Ginsburg contended that the anti-apartheid activist, Henry Isaacs
and TransAfrica Inc., a group that opposes white minority rule in
South Africa had standing in the case.
   The congressmen who challenged the NRC decision were: Reps.
Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif.; Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif.; William H.
Gray III, D-Pa.; Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.; Charles B. Rangel,
D-N.Y.; Bill Richardson, D-N.M. and Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.

<HEAD>Sinatra's Miniature Trains Ride Through Hoboken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Frank Sinatra wants to get on track with
thoughts about his boyhood neighborhood in New Jersey, all he has to
do is hop a train _ one of 250 model trains that race through
favorite neighborhoods, including a miniature Hoboken.
   ``At Christmas when I was a kid, I'd leave Hoboken and take a
four-cent ferry ride and a five-cent train ride and head to the New
York stores. I'd stand and look at the train displays for three or
four hours until a saleslady would say, `Please don't touch _ and
would you mind moving back a bit?''' Ol' Blue Eyes says in this
weekend's edition of USA Weekend magazine.
   ``I wanted a train set so badly but I didn't know how my family
could ever afford it,'' Sinatra says. ``One day, my mother pawned
her fox fur piece to buy my first train set, a windup engine and an
oval track. I never forgot that.
   ``It was probably the only decent thing she had to wear and I was
old enough (11) to understand the sacrifice.''
   So, now, at his Rancho Mirage, Calif., home, Sinatra has an
18-foot by 30-foot train station with the 250 model traincars. Five
trains can run simultaneously on independent loops, running through
Hoboken or an Old West town and passing by a New Orleans riverboat
with a billboard announcing a sold-out Sinatra concert.
   There's one locomotive with his initials, FAS, in diamonds; a
crystal replica of the 1925 Chattanooga Choo Choo and two dozen
1895-1900 engine replicas. The magazine did not include the value of
the train.
   ``When I'm just bumming around the house with not much to do,
I'll clean the tracks, oil the engines, change the cars. The noise
of the trains running and whistling can get pretty loud, but
watching the trains just removes my head from thinking about work,''
Sinatra says.
   ``My electrician loves to get a call about a problem with the
trains. Usually, after he's found the problem, he'll say, `Why don't
we just try the whole set to make absolutely sure everything is OK?'
And I say, `Yeah, let's turn the whole room on just to be sure.'''

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba may close up to 15 of its diplomatic
missions abroad because the government is short on cash, the Cuban
news agency Prensa Latina reported Friday.
   President Fidel Castro told the Central Committee of the Cuban
Communist Party the closings might be needed to direct foreign
exchange reserves to domestic development, the agency said in a
dispatch received in Mexico City.
   Castro said the 1989 Cuban Economic Program ``had to be
elaborated in extremely difficult conditions and is directed at
solving problems,'' the report said.
   It did not say in what countries Cuban embassies and consulates
might be closed.
   Castro said the economic strategy is designed ``to prevent
reductions in what already has been accomplished, to maintain levels
of nutrition and health and to continue working to solve the
currency deficit that for several years has wounded the economy of
the island.''
   Under an economic cooperation agreement, the Soviet Union sends
the dollar proceeds of its oil export sales to Cuba. The dollar's
depreciation in international currency markets has hit Cuba's
foreign exchange reserves.
   Citing a dollar shortage, Cuba asked Western creditor nations
this year to reschedule its estimated $5.5 billion foreign debt over
15 years and ask for a five-year grace period, according to a
central bank document released in March.
   The request reportedly was turned down, according to Manuel
Sanchez Perez, a former deputy trade minister who defected in 1985.

   Thirty-eight sets of remains believed to be those
of U.S. servicemen killed during the Vietnam War were returned to
U.S. soil Friday, 13 years after the war ended.
   The repatriation was the seventh and largest since the Vietnamese
government agreed in August 1987 to help the United States recover
the remains of its lost soldiers. Since then, 172 sets of remains
returned by Vietnam have been identified as Americans.
   The remains of two others have been recovered from China, and 26
other sets of remains were recovered and identified from Laos, the
military said.
   Thirty-eight metal caskets were unloaded from the C-141 Army
transport plane under drizzly skies at Hickam Air Force Base. Draped
with American flags, the caskets passed honor and color guards as
military personnel carried them to waiting buses for transfer to the
Army's Central Identification Laboratory. About 50 people, mostly
base employees, attended the solemn, 1{-hour ceremony.
   At the lab, forensic experts will try to determine if the remains
are those of any of the 1,747 Americans listed as missing in action
in Vietnam.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA: 1,747 in Vietnam,
547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia, and six in China.
   Hanoi officials released the remains to U.S. officials Thursday.
They also turned over dog tags, military identification cards and
other information that might help identify the bodies, said Maj. Dan
Trout of the U.S. Pacific Command.
   Military officials said they did not know how long it would take
to identify the remains and refused to release the details of their
recovery.
   ``It's absolutely unpredictable, and we won't release any
identity until it's an absolute positive one,'' said Trout. ``We
don't release specific information about the recovery sites or what
exactly was found in deference to the families (of missing
servicemen). We don't want them to have to speculate.''
   The previous largest turnover of suspected MIA remains involved
27 sets handed over April 6.
   In addition to turning over the latest remains, the Vietnamese
also gave information on 12 other missing Americans, Trout said.
``The level of cooperation from the Vietnamese has been very good.''
   He said Vietnamese and American technical experts would meet in
Hanoi Monday through Wednesday to review work and discuss future
joint projects.
   Meanwhile, other officials were investigating reports that some
Americans were still prisoners in Southeast Asia, the major said.
   ``A lot of reports of Americans still alive come from refugees in
the area,'' he said. ``We don't have any evidence ... but we don't
rule that out as a possibility.''
   About 58,000 Americans died during the Vietnam War. U.S.
involvement extended from March 1965 to the signing of the Paris
Peace accords in January 1973.

   U.S. and Soviet negotiators have reached
virtual agreement on ways to measure some underground nuclear tests
but a final agreement still eludes the two sides, the State
Department said Friday.
   The result is further postponement of possible Senate
ratification of two nuclear test treaties completed more than a
decade ago. The treaties would limit underground blasts to 150
kilotons.
   President Reagan has said he would submit the 1974 accord on
weapons tests and the 1976 agreement on tests for civilian purposes
only if agreement were reached on air-tight procedures to guard
against cheating.
   Reagan has accused the Soviets of carrying out tests that
probably exceeded the permissible ceiling. Some American experts
doubted the Soviets had violated the treaties, which both sides are
supposed to be obseving even though the Senate has not approved the
pacts.
   Other experts said the problem was a lack of reliable ways to
measure underground blasts _ the only kind still legal _ and it was
difficult to tell whether the Soviets were in compliance.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, meanwhile, suspended all
Soviets tests in August 1985 and invited the United States to join
the moratorium. The Reagan administration rejected the proposal.
Administration officials said it was necessary to conduct U.S. tests
in Nevada to improve American nuclear weapons, and the Soviets
resumed testing in February 1987.
   The latest round of talks, which adjourned Thursday in Geneva
after four months, was termed a success by Charles E. Redman, the
State Department spokesman.
   He said work on the 1976 civilian test ban treaty ``has been
substantially finished.'' But Redman said further work was required
on the 1974 accord, which is far more important since it deals with
weapons development.
   The main problem, he said, is that the Soviets want to place
restrictions on the American system of measurement, known as CORTEX,
which is being used under the 1976 treaty. Some American experts
consider the method of using cables dropped into a foot-wide hole
parallel to the test shaft more reliable than remote seismic
measurements.
   The two sides did not set a date for resuming the negotiations.
That is a decision to be taken by the Bush administration.
   Last July, Americans and Soviets carried out a joint experiment
at the U.S. test site in Nevada on verification procedures. A second
joint experiment was held in Semipalatinsk in September.

   President Reagan signed an executive order
Friday that establishes a National Microgravity Research Board to
oversee scientific studies on the near-weightlessness of space.
   On Feb. 11, in announcing a sweeping new space policy for the
United States, the president said he would establish a such a board
``to assure and coordinate a broader range of opportunities for
research in microgravity conditions.''
   The board, to be chaired by the administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, is to advise on priorities for
research in the near-weightlessness of space and to consult with
private industry and universities on research opportunities.
   It also is to develop policy recommendations to the government on
matters bearing on types of research, the roles of government,
industry and academia, and on access to space.
   The executive order calls for the board to be composed of the
secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Health and Human Services,
Transportation, Energy and the director of the National Science
Foundation or their designees.

   A congressional study says the Air Force is
running two years late and well above cost estimates with a
problem-plagued project to replace a vital computer link in the air
defense system for North America.
   The latest projected pricetag for the new computer system for the
North American Aerospace Defense Command is $281 million, according
to the General Accounting Office, the investigative agency for
Congress.
   That figure is $39 million above what the Air Force in April 1987
estimated it would cost to replace the aging computers that are
supposed to provide U.S. and Canadian leaders with vital information
in case of an air attack.
   When the new system for the Colorado installation was proposed in
1981, the Air Force estimated it would cost $202 million, GAO said
in a report to the House Appropriations defense subcommittee.
   The study said the new system, being developed by General
Telephone and Electronics Inc., is not expected to be operational
until September 1991, two years later than planned.
   According to GAO, a number of problems have been encountered with
the first phase of the project, a semi-automated control unit that
monitors communication lines and switches to backup lines and
equipment when communication quality deteriorates.
   The problems include unreliable computer software that would
cause a loss of communications if the software failed to perform
properly in an emergency.
   ``A failure of this nature during actual operations could
seriously affect the Air Force's ability to satisfy mission
requirements during a crisis,'' GAO said.
   The Defense Department told GAO that the software problem has
been isolated and will be fixed by GTE.
   The department said the contractor is also fixing another problem
cited by GAO: during a test, it took 31 minutes to restart the unit
after a power failure _ 29 minutes longer than specified by the
contract.
   GAO said the Air Force will have to spend $5 million rewiring
NORAD's Cheyenne Mountain communications center because the wiring
on the new gear is not compatible with wiring on some, and perhaps
all, existing electronics equipment in the center.
   The Defense Department said that GTE followed the ``circuit
interface standards specified by the Air Force.''

   The nation's first ordinance banning the
movie ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' has been repealed by a
county in the Florida Panhandle.
   The ordinance was thrown out by a federal judge Sept. 9, the day
after the Escambia County Commission adopted it, but remained on the
books until Thursday night's meeting. The commission also agreed to
pay the $10,000 legal fee for the Tampa law firm of Holland & Knight
that successfully challenged the constitutionality of the movie ban.
   The commissioners passed the emergency ordinance 4-1 after
several people charged the film directed by Martin Scorsese was
anti-Christian.
   Commission Chairman Willie Junior said jokingly Thursday that he
will ask the people who requested the ordinance for contributions
toward the $10,000 bill.
   ``They said they would help out, and we would really appreciate
them passing the plate on Sunday,'' he said.

   Angola and Cuba have agreed in principle
that several dozen U.N. peacekeepers will monitor the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, a senior U.N. official said Friday.
   The official, who is involved in plans for a peace settlement in
southwestern Africa, said the force probably will number no more
than 50 and will be largely symbolic. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said the force would be separate from the 7,500 U.N.
peacekeepers assigned to monitor South Africa's withdrawal next year
from South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Marrack Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping
operations, met with visiting Cuban and Angolan military officials
this week about the matter.
   U.S. spy satellites are expected to provide intelligence data
about the Cuban witdrawal demanded by South Africa.
   Cuba, Angola and South Africa signed an agreement Tuesday
involving Cuban and South African withdrawal and independence for
Namibia, which South Africa has controlled for 73 years. Cuban
troops are to be withdrawn over 30 months, with half gone by Nov. 1,
1989.
   The independence program for Namibia is to begin April 1, and
3,000 Cuban troops are to be out of Angola by that date. Namibian
elections are planned for Nov. 1.
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos affirmed his country's
commitment to the peace efforts, Angola's official news agency ANGOP
reported Friday.
   In a report monitored in Lisbon, ANGOP said dos Santos spoke
Thursday in the Atlantic archipelago nation of Cape Verde.
   Dos Santos planned to visit Cuba for four days, then fly to New
York for the formal signing of the peace accord on Dec. 22.
   Cuban troops went to Angola, after the Portuguese colony became
independent in 1975, to help the Marxist government repel the
attacks of guerrillas backed by South Africa. The South Africans
insisted on withdrawal as a condition for their cooperation with the
10-year-old U.N. independence plan for Namibia.
   The Reagan administration made linkage of the withdrawal and
Namibian independence a keystone of its southern Africa policy.
   South Africa captured South-West Africa from Germany in World War
I and was given a League of Nations mandate to govern the territory,
which is rich in minerals. The U.N. General Assembly revoked the
mandate in 1966, but South Africa refused to leave.
   Both sides reported continued heavy fighting in Angola.
   Statements distributed in Lisbon by the rebels of UNITA, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, claimed they
killed 96 soldiers in recent encounters, losing 10 of their own men.
   ANGOP also reported 62 rebels killed, with the loss of 12
government troopers.

   Heavy snow thwarted rescuers Friday from
reaching two pilots stranded since Tuesday on a remote glacier in
British Columbia after their vintage plane made an emergency landing.
   A Coast Guard H-3 helicopter couldn't reach the site because of
whiteout conditions on Grand Pacific Glacier and returned to Alaska
to wait for the weather to clear, Coast Guard spokesman Ed Moreth
said.
   The forecast called for clearing Saturday, and officials expected
the next rescue attempt then. Meanwhile, the two men prepared to
spend their fourth night in the World War II-era Grumman Widgeon
amphibious plane.
   ``They were a little bit colder than they were, but they're doing
OK,'' said Chris Haley, a petty officer at the Coast Guard station
in Juneau. ``They're still inside the plane and just biding their
time until we can get in there and pick them up.''
   The pair are equipped with survival gear and have enough food to
last two to three more days, officials said. Nightly temperatures on
the glacier were estimated at about 20 to 25 degrees, said Robert
Jacobson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
   Coast Guard officials have kept in radio contact with pilot
Michael Mills, 38, and passenger Charles Ferguson, 31, of Gustavus,
by flying a C-130 transport plane over the glacier. The plane was
sent back to Kodiak Friday morning and will return Saturday, said
Haley.
   Neither the men nor the plane was hurt in the emergency landing
Tuesday. Mills' wife said the plane had recently been restored and
Haley said it may have been forced down by engine trouble.
   On Thursday, the helicopter landed near the face of the glacier
at Tarr Inlet, but the weather never cleared. The craft reached an
elevation of only 1,500 feet above sea level, and the stranded men
are several miles inland at the 3,400-foot level, said Cmdr. Bruce
Merchant.
   Tarr Inlet is in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and is
about 60 miles north of Gustavus, a small southeast Alaska port
town. The huge glacier stretches far into British Columbia.
   The two men are several miles inside Canada. Coast Guard
officials said they had received permission from the Canadian
government to conduct the rescue.

   U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. opened talks with the
PLO and both sides said they hoped the dialogue would lead to a
comprehensive Middle East peace.
   ```Our discussions were very practical and characterized, I would
say, by seriousness of purpose,'' Pelletreau said after the
90-minute meeting with a four-man PLO delegation.
   The ambassador implied there would be other meetings but did not
say when.

   President Reagan said America's ``strong and steadfast'' support
of Israel's statehood persuaded the PLO to moderate its views.
   Reagan called the opening in negotiations with the PLO ``a great
step forward,'' said peace will be achieved only ``when the
principals come together to negotiate.'' He said he made the
decision to talk with the PLO because they accepted Israel's
sovereignty and renounced terrorism ``without fuzzing it up with
ambiguous dialogue.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ISRAEL-PLO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dialogue with the PLO is forcing Israel to reassess its
policy, and politicians both left and right now are searching for a
alternative plan for peace negotiations.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the center-left Labor
Party, proposed elections in which Palestinians of the occupied
lands would choose local leaders to negotiate with Israel.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who leads the conservative Likud
bloc, is considering ``new moves'' and aides say he recognizes the
need for a credible Israeli plan.
   Nimrod Novick, political adviser to Peres, said Israel must
develop a peace plan capable of reducing international pressure.
   ``If we put an initiative on the table, we force all other
parties to deal with it,'' he said. ``If we sit quietly, we will be
forced to deal with the initiative of someone else.''

   Soldiers killed four Palestinians in the occupied territories
Friday after a funeral procession in Nablus escalated into street
battles. Soldiers imposed a curfew, barring journalists and
photographers.
   Doctors said 20 people were wounded in Nablus, four of them
critically. An army spokesman confirmed four killed and nine wounded.
   An aide to Shamir said the day's outburst was evidence the United
States should not have contacts with the PLO.
   ``This is the result of giving in to people of violence,'' Avi
Pazner said.

   Christmas tourism has dropped sharply because of the Palestinian
uprising, and some hotel managers in Nazareth and Jerusalem, where
many of the traditional festivities have been canceled, say they
have no bookings at all for the holidays.
   The ministry predicts that 70,000 visitors will arrive in
December, a decline of 14 percent from 1987. Before the uprising
began a year ago, it was predicting that 1988 would be a record
tourism year because it coincided with the 40th anniversary of
Israel's founding.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa on Friday
led 3,000 people in honoring Baltic seacoast workers killed in 1970
riots, and said he is beginning to see signs of a new opportunity
for Poland.
   ``Something is becoming visible in this country. I don't know
what it is. Maybe we will fail once more,'' Walesa told a rally at
the Lenin Shipyard.
   ``But when there is a chance, even a minimal chance (we) must
undertake it. Because it is a chance for Poland, for all of us, and
especially for youth.
   ``We cannot waste it.''
   Walesa seemed to be referring to the communist government's
growing tolerance for Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first
independent union movement, which was crushed under martial law in
1981.
   The official media have increased non-critical coverage of Walesa
and the government has made overtures to him to begin a dialogue.
   Walesa walked at the head of a procession of work crews from
inside the shipyard to the monument to the slain workers outside its
gates.
   As the crowd pressed around him, he gently laid a wreath of red
and white carnations and led the singing of two patriotic hymns,
including the national anthem.
   The ceremony, under gray skies. marked the 18th anniversary of
the riots for ``freedom and bread.'' Security forces shot down
dozens of coast workers, including at least 27 in Gdansk. The exact
number of victims was never revealed.
   Also on this date in 1981, riot police stormed the Wujek mine in
Katowice and killed nine miners during the imposition of martial law.
   Officially outlawed Solidarity also sponsored peaceful rallies
outside the Lenin Steel Mill in Nowa Huta, near Krakow, and in
Katowice, in southern Poland.
   Walesa attended a memorial Mass on Friday evening in Gdansk.
Later, hundreds of riot police shepherded the worshipers to a train
station a few blocks away. The crowd sang only religious songs
punctuated by a few chants of ``Solidarity!''
   Departing from past practice, state-controlled radio and
television Friday covered the Solidarity wreath-laying in addition
to the official ceremonies.
   ``One of the most tragic dates in the history of the nation,'' a
TV commentator said.
   The 1970 killings were a seminal event in the development of the
modern opposition movement in Poland. Workers began rioting when the
government announced drastic food price increases just before
Christmas.
   The brutal repression of the protests created an outcry that
ended the 14-year national leadership of Wladyslaw Gomulka and
radicalized a generation of young workers, including Walesa.
   Walesa led the next Gdansk workers' revolt of 1980 that resulted
in Solidarity.

<HEAD>President to Seek $6 Billion in Foreign Credits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGIO CARRACSO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has asked
congress for approval to seek $6 billion in foreign credits next
year as a means of reviving the economy.
   Salinas, sworn in Dec. 1, said the $6 billion would cover a
projected $5 billion balance of payments deficit next year and
provide money for development.
   In a message with the 1989 budget sent to the Chamber of Deputies
late Thursday, he said the deficit would stem from ``dynamism in
imports associated with the economic recovery and conservative
petroleum export income.''
   ``It is my conviction that the construction of the economic
future ... must be the prerogative and responsibility of all
society,'' he said.
   Reductions in trade barriers have caused a 50 percent increase in
imports this year from 1987. Weak demand and low prices on the world
oil market have cost Mexico at least $2 billion in anticipated 1988
export revenue.
   The Salinas budget forecasts a ``positive, though moderate'' 1.5
percent growth rate next year, up from 0.4 percent this year. It
said the economy grew 1.4 percent in 1986.
   Under a wage-price freeze begun in March, Mexico's 1988 inflation
rate is expected to be 51 percent, the document said.
   Inflation for the first 11 months was just over 48 percent, after
a record 159.2 percent in 1987, the central bank has reported.
   For 1989, inflation is expected to be 22 percent or lower,
according to the budget. Earlier this week, the president announced
an extension of freeze through June 1989.
   Among his 1989 policy goals, Salinas included:
   _Achieving price stability.
   _Protecting the jobs and purchasing power of workers.
   _Increasing business and labor support for his anti-inflation
program and his proposals for negotiating better terms on the $102
billion foreign debt.
   Forthcoming talks with foreign creditors dominated Salinas'
message to congress. He promised a ``firm'' stand with creditor
banks and dwelt on what the debt has cost the Mexican economy.
   Salinas said, ``The national product has been checked, investment
has abated, real salaries have been reduced and the creation of jobs
has been insufficient to give the opportunity of well-paid work. ...
The priority is growth. The net transfer of resources will have to
be reduced substantially.''
   The president contends Mexico no longer can afford to spend 5
percent of its gross national product on debt service _ about $14
billion in interest and principal this year.
   On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe said the government
wants to reduce the debt-service figure to 3 percent.

   The Associated Press announced Friday it is
creating a new control bureau for South Dakota and North Dakota, and
named Tena Haraldson as bureau chief.
   The new bureau will be in Sioux Falls, S.D., which had been a
satellite office under the news agency's Minneapolis bureau, AP
President Louis D. Boccardi said.
   Haraldson, who has been correspondent in Sioux Falls, will direct
AP's news, photo and newspaper marketing operations in the two
states. Other AP offices in the new territory are in Pierre, S.D.,
and in Bismarck and Fargo, N.D. All had been under the direction of
the AP's Minneapolis bureau chief.
   ``This restructuring will allow us to expand and improve our
coverage of the Dakotas and bring control of our services closer to
our members in the two states,'' said Boccardi. ``In Tena Haraldson
we have a talented journalist and manager who is familiar with the
region, its issues and the needs of our members.''
   Haraldson, 34, has worked for the AP in South Dakota since 1976.
She joined in Sioux Falls, was named Pierre correspondent in 1980
and Sioux Falls correspondent in 1983.
   Haraldson is a native of San Angelo, Texas, who grew up in South
Dakota and graduated from South Dakota State University.

   A 154-foot British freighter caught
fire and capsized after colliding Friday with a Dutch freighter
about 10 miles east of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
   All 13 crew members of the British ship Wishing Star were rescued
from the water by the 594-foot Dutch-registered container ship
Nedlloyed Van Noork, and no one was injured, Coast Guard spokesman
Alan Burd said.
   The Wishing Star, carrying propane and general cargo, caught fire
in the collision and the crew had to abandon ship, Burd said. The
Coast Guard was working to sink the vessel to protect beaches and
nesting areas along northeast Puerto Rico.
   Burd said the reason for the collision was not immediately known.
   He said the collision occurred around 2 a.m. between Puerto Rico
and Culebra Island, which is under Puerto Rican jurisdiction. The
Wishing Star caught fire shortly after the collision and capsized
around 5 a.m., Burd said.
   He said the ships were traveling in opposite directions, with the
Dutch ship headed for San Juan. He did not know their ports of
origin.
   Burd said the Coast Guard would not investigate,since the
collision happened in international waters and involved foreign
vessels.

   People in cities shattered by the Dec. 7
earthquake flung themselves before bulldozers to keep workers from
clearing rubble until bodies of relatives were found, the Soviet
premier said Friday.
   Tanks and armored personnel carriers sealed off Spitak, one of
the devastated Armenian cities. At least 10 bulldozers cleared
debris and trucks hauled it away, said Morten Horvaal, an Associated
Press photographer who drove past Spitak twice on Friday.
   The head of the Communist Party in Spitak, 46 miles northwest of
Yerevan, told the AP Thursday that demolition would begin Sunday.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov did not give details of the disruption
by residents, mentioned during a televised report of a meeting of
the Politburo commission overseeing rescue and relief opwera;tions.
   He said one more survivor was pulled from the ruins Thursday in
Spitak, where the quake killed about 15,000 of the 25,000 residents.
Officials estimate the overall death toll at 55,000.
   The head of the Soviet Red Cross said Soviet doctors can handle
the treatment of earthquake victims and do not need international
help.
   Several foreign doctors complained privately that Soviet
colleagues would not let them treat patients with the millions of
dollars worth of sophisticated medical equipment brought in
especially for the disaster.
   Dr. Dmitri Venidiktov, chairman of the Soviet Red Cross and
former deputy health minister, said at a news conference in Yerevan,
capital of the Armenian republic, about foreign help: ``If we talk
about doctors and nurses, I can say thank you very much, but it's no
longer necessary, ''
   He said medical teams had arrived from throughout the Soviet
Union, and ``we can accept individuals (from abroad) to show them
what has been done but we don't need medical assistance in the
direct sense.''
   Ryzhkov praised foreign volunteers and said the Foreign Ministry
had not given them enough assistance.
   ``They helped in a big way,'' the premier said, even though ``you
can't even find translators here.''
   Some foreign doctors said they were leaving earlier than planned,
but others were on the way to the stricken region.
   Thirty-five Israeli doctors and health care workers had been
expected Friday, but fog at the small Yerevan airport prevented
their arrival. More than 100 international flights have landed at
Yerevan since the quake.
   George Reid, spokesman for the international League of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies, said 22,312 bodies were recovered by
Friday, an increase of 537 from the previous day. Reid said the
projected death toll was 45,000.
   Soviet officials say the quake claimed 55,000 lives and left
500,000 of the 700,000 people in the area homeless.
   Dr. Robert Gale, an American who helped the Soviets during the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster more than two years ago, told The
Associated Press he believed 100,000 people had been killed, based
on personal observation.
   Reid said 5,079 injured remained hospitalized and 4,440 had been
discharged. ``The Red Cross is feeding 500,000 people in Ethiopia,
and we had years to prepare,'' he said. ``That's about the number
affected here in 20 seconds.''
   The Red Cross is bringing in 5,000 winter tents like those used
by the Norwegian army and Soviet authorities are hoping to bring in
thousands of yurts, modern versions of Mongol tents, by rail, he
said.
   Soviet officials also hope to bring in mobile homes, Reid said,
adding that 5,000 are needed in Spitak alone to shelter local men
who will work on rebuilding the town.
   Eduard Aikazyan, the Armenian government representative in
Moscow, said the rebuilding of ruined cities and towns would not
begin until rescue efforts were finished, but he did not say when
that would be.
   He said each survivor would be given 500 rubles and families
would get 2,000 rubles in addition to the individual allowances.
   Aikazyan said evacuation of women and children to sanatoriums and
vacation resorts would continue.
   ``One can imagine the mental condition of many people who
witnessed the catastrophe,'' he said. ``They need rest.''
   Those who want to remain near their homes will be allowed to do
so, he said, and commented: ``There are people who prefer to live
even in ruins.''

<TEXT>
   A new immigration policy to sort out and
deport immigrants filing unfounded political asylum claims before
they travel farther into the United States began Friday in the
southern tip of Texas.
   The Brownsville area is the main entry for Central Americans who
cross the border illegally and claim political asylum, and the new
policy is expected to concentrate more displaced would-be immigrants
in the lower Rio Grande Valley.
   It requires the 2,000 asylum applicants each week present their
cases in the area, instead of waiting to apply until they reach
their final destinations. Brownsville is about 30 miles south of
Harlingen.
   Very few of the immigrants intend to stay in impoverished
southern Texas, where unemployment ranges from 12 percent to 50
percent and many people live in rural slums that lack running water.
   To deal with the workload from the new policy, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service sent six additional adjudicators to
Harlingen to work 10 hours a day, six days a week interviewing
applicants. It will send 20 more after Jan. 1, officials said.
   The procedure applies to all nationalities, but was designed to
relieve the backlog of asylum applicants in places such as Los
Angeles, with 30,000 pending cases, and Miami, with a backlog of
50,000, said Rick Kenney, an INS spokesman in Washington.
   Similar procedures have taken effect in those two cities, which
are also congregating points.
   In the lower Rio Grande Valley, refugee shelters have been filled
to capacity for months. Many immigrants end up sleeping outdoors or
in dilapidated immigrant motels.
   INS Harlingen District Director Jerry Sewell said he hopes fewer
people will come once word reaches Central America that the agency
is cracking down on asylum.
   The INS turned people away Friday in Harlingen after limiting the
number of asylum applicants to 200 for the day. The INS has promised
to provide decisions on the cases within 30 days, and applicants
were instructed to return Jan. 16.
   Files will be sent to Washington for advisory opinions on each
case.
   INS officials said travel outside the area probably will be too
expensive for most applicants, who must return for their decisions
or face deportation. Those denied asylum will be asked to leave the
country within 30 days, but may appeal through an immigration court.
   INS officials maintain that most applicants are ineligible for
asylum because they merely want to better themselves economically.
Asylum generally is granted for political reasons.
   Previously, when applicants applied at their destination cities,
some would wait more than a year for a decision because of the
backlog. Cases taking longer than 60 days require the INS to provide
work authorization, which many received. Those in the faster process
in Harlingen, however, will not be allowed to work, officials said.
   In San Francisco, a federal judge issued a ruling this week that
could affect the new INS policy if it is extended to other
jurisdictions. U.S. District Judge Charles Legge ruled that work
permits must be given to aliens throughout their appeal of an asylum
decision, a process that can take several years.
   Legge ordered the INS to provide work permits to a group of farm
workers from Central America during the period in which their
applications for asylum have been denied and a deportation hearing
has not yet been scheduled.
   Refugee advocates contend that keeping the immigrants in southern
Texas while they await asylum decisions will only increase the
misery and concentration of Central Americans in the area.
   ``I think the people are going to be more visible,'' said Ninfa
Krueger, with the Border Association for Refugees from Central
America, which provides legal advocacy and social services.
``There's a concern already that we don't have the means to take
care of them.''
   ``The policy is meant to scare people enough to make them stop
coming, but I think they're more scared of the war and they'll keep
coming,'' Ms. Krueger said.
   Antonio, a 27-year-old Nicaraguan who illegally crossed the Rio
Grande on inner tubes Tuesday with a group of 25 immigrants, waited
outside the INS office Friday.
   ``I don't know where I'm going to go,'' he said while looking for
someone who understood enough English to help him fill out his
application.
   Antonio, who asked that his last name not be used in order to
protect his family in Managua, said he has a relative in Miami, his
intended destination, where he could stay.
   ``But I don't have the money to travel there and then come back
here,'' he said in Spanish. ``There's no place to go.''
   ``I think at first we may see a slightly higher number of aliens
in the area, but that will soon taper off as soon as word gets back
to Central America that Harlingen is no longer providing a free
ride,'' said Virginia Kice, an INS spokeswoman in Harlingen.

<HEAD>Economist Replaces Hardliner On Foreign Affairs Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Czechoslovak Communist Party
appointed a top economic official to replace a veteran party
hardliner as head of a commission on foreign affairs, a party
spokesman said Friday.
   The appointment of Jozef Lenart, 65, indicates the leadership
wants to focus greater attention on boosting foreign economic
cooperation.
   Lenart replaces Vasil Bilak, 71, who resigned all his political
posts Thursday, citing his 20-year service as a Central Committee
secretary and member of the ruling Politburo.
   Spokesman Vladimir Patek made the announcement to journalists at
the end of a two-day party Central Committee meeting.
   He said Miroslav Valek also resigned as Slovak culture minister
at his own request, but remained a member of the Central Committee.
Valek last month called on the country's leadership to correct
mistakes made since the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968 were
crushed by Soviet-led troops.
   Lenart is a Central Committee secretary in charge of the economy
and heads the party's commission for the national economy.
   He served as premier from 1963 to 1968, when the country began
implementing economic reforms leading up to the Prague Spring
reforms of then-Communist leader Alexander Dubcek.
   Patek told journalists the personnel changes were ``nothing but a
healthy variation of cadres and should not be given any other
context.''
   Communist Party leader Milos Jakes said in a closing speech to
the Central Committee meeting that economic reforms must be speeded
up, the official CTK news agency reported.
   The meeting examined economic results for this year and plans for
next year. It decided to convene the next party congress on May 10,
1990, one year ahead of schedule.
   Addressing the session Thursday, Premier Ladislav Adamec
criticized the country's trade status with Western countries. ``We
export to maintain our production and markets, but this does not
improve our position in convertible currencies,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Former Ohio Rep. Jim Stanton is being backed by
former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill of Massachusetts and Ohio
Sens. John Glenn and Howard Metzenbaum to be the Democratic Party's
next national chairman, a Metzenbaum spokeswoman said Friday.
   O'Neill, Glenn, Metzenbaum and Ohio Reps. Mary Rose Oakar and
Louis Stokes signed a Mailgram urging labor leaders nationwide to
throw their support behind Stanton, said Nancy Coffey, Metzenbaum's
press secretary.
   Stanton has not been in the public eye since his 1976 loss to
Metzenbaum in the Democratic Senate primary in Ohio. But he recently
moved to Washington and started laying plans for a return to
political life.
   The Mailgram praises Stanton as ``a friend of the labor movement
for many, many years.''
   ``For all practical purposes the Democratic Party's race to the
presidency in 1992 has already begun,'' it said. ``Our first step
must be to unite behind a leader who can reach out and appeal to
every corner of our diverse party. We believe Jim Stanton is such a
leader, and the support of labor is crucial to his candidacy.''
   The party's new leader is to be chosen at a meeting in Washington
Feb. 9 and 10 of the nearly 400 voting members of the Democratic
National Committee.
   Stanton so far has not been considered a front-runner for the job
being vacated after four years by Paul Kirk.
   Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Richard Wiener and longtime
party activist Ronald H. Brown have been mentioned most often as the
leading candidates in a field that also includes former Reps. James
Jones of Oklahoma and Michael Barnes of Maryland.
   Stanton was not in his office Friday afternoon and could not be
reached for comment.

<HEAD>Federal Reserve Panel Moved Toward Higher Interest Rates in
November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Policy-makers at the Federal Reserve, fearing
that a moderation in the growth rate of the economy might have been
temporary, decided at their November meeting to tilt toward higher
interest rates, according to minutes of that session released Friday.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which establishes monetary
policy for the central bank, voted 11-1 on Nov. 1 to leave policy
unchanged for the time being.
   But, in a directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the
committee said ``somewhat greater reserve restraint might be
acceptable'' depending on inflation and the strength of the economy
and called for ``remaining especially alert to potential
developments that might require some firming'' of monetary policy.
   The New York bank buys and sells government securities owned by
banks to drain or swell the amount of reserves the banks have to
make loans, and thus influence the price, or interest rate on those
loans.
   The Fed, whose main job is to guard against inflation, is seeking
to slow the growth of the economy as measured by the gross national
product from the 3 percent to 3.5 percent range to a level it
consider sustainable without inflation, between 2 percent to 2.5
percent.
   In late March, it began a series of credit tightening moves,
culminating in August with a one-half percentage point increase to
6.5 percent in its discount rate, the interest it charges to make
bank loans.
   Economic statistics for August and September led some economists
to conclude that the policy was succeeding in dampening the economy.
But figures for October and November show a rebound. Unemployment is
near a 14-year low and factories are using more of their capacity
than at any time in nine years, a development economists say could
lead to shortages and price increases.
   Market participants say it became clear this week that the Fed
decided to begin nudging interest rates higher again. The federal
funds rate, the rate at which banks make overnight loans among
themselves, rose from about 8.4 percent on Tuesday to 8.9 percent
Friday.
   Consumer rates have responded by also heading higher. Fixed-rate
mortgages, not including special add-on fees known as points,
averaged 10.71 percent this week, matching the high for the year.
One-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, at 8.43 percent, were the
highest in 14 months.
   In November, the minutes said, ``a majority of the (Fed
committee) members believed that operations should be adjusted more
readily toward further tightening than toward any easing,'' although
some of the members going along with the directive ``were less
inclined than they had been previously to bias it toward further
restraint.''
   Fed Gov. Martha Seger, who cast the only dissenting vote, said
unchanged policy was acceptable to her but she ``did not want to
bias the directive toward potential tightening,'' the minutes said.
   ``In her view,'' they said, ``current indications of slower
economic growth ... pointed to ... reduced inflationary pressures
over the year ahead.''
   The open market committee met again this week to discuss monetary
policy. The minutes of that meeting won't be released until after
the next meeting on Feb. 7-8. The committee is composed of the
seven-member Federal Reserve Board and five of the 12 presidents of
the Fed's district banks.

<HEAD>Postmaster, Perot Agree To Terminate Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank announced
Friday that the Postal Service and Dallas billionaire H. Ross
Perot's company, Perot Systems Corp., have agreed to drop their
embattled $500,000 no-bid contract to study cost-savings measures.
   ``Despite an excellent effort by Perot Systems, the contract has
been tied up so badly by protests and lawsuits that we have lost
much of the original opportunity. And even more delays are likely
due to still active lawsuits between Perot and General Motors,''
Frank said in a statement.
   Perot and his former company, Electronic Data Systems, are locked
in state and federal lawsuits over whether he is violating a
covenant with EDS not to compete against the company until December
1989. The agreement stems from his bitter break with General Motors
Corp. two years after selling the automaker the data-processing
company he founded in 1962.
   Under the May 27 contract with the Postal Service, Perot Systems,
a computer services firm, was to identify cost savings and then
implement the proposed changes in return for a share of the savings.
Challenges to the Postal Service's authority to issue the contract
were filed in June and work was suspended July 8.
   EDS and lawmakers had complained that the Postal Service contract
unfairly favored Perot. The contract was the first for Perot Systems.
   The General Services Administration then canceled the contract,
but the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington overturned that
ruling. Frank's suspension of the deal, however, remained in effect
until his agreement Friday with Perot to drop it completely.
   Perot Systems said in a statement that it wished the Postal
Service well ``and sincerely hope that they will have the
opportunity to implement the changes that they know must be made.''
   ``It was a bad contract to begin with,'' said EDS spokesman Roger
Still. ``Today's action is in the best interest of the competitive
process. Our objective all along was to get it in the competitive
process as opposed to the sweetheart deal that it was.''
   Frank said the Postal Service had negotiated what it hoped would
be ``an exceptionally productive agreement.''
   However, ``We have reached the point where we no longer enjoy the
same advantage,'' Frank said. ``The interests of competing
companies, and the concerns of General Motors about Mr. Perot's
severance agreement, have led to protests and lawsuits which have
forced suspension of all work under the contract.''
   Frank said the studies the service had hoped to complete last
August cannot now be done before February, ``and could well be
further delayed by active litigation.''
   Under an injunction stemming from a lawsuit filed by EDS in
Fairfax County, Va., Perot is prohibited from performing work on any
contract or seeking any new contract which could be profitable to
his new firm.
   ``This has effectively prohibited Perot Systems from resuming
work under the original Postal Service agreement,'' the service said
in a statement.

<TEXT>
   The sand dunes of Cape Hatteras, N.C., got some rare snow Friday
and Southern California endured a second day of snow, rain and high
winds, but the nation's midsection had mostly sunny, clear weather.
   In addition to coastal North Carolina, parts of northeastern
South Carolina also got some snow and sleet. Heavier snowfall during
the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 3 inches at New Bern,
and 2 inches at Hatteras, Wilmington and Cherry Point, all in North
Carolina.
   Snow and winter weather advisories were still in effect for the
northern and central coastal areas and the outer banks of North
Carolina.
   In Southern California, snow ended in the lower elevations but
continued in the mountains. A winter storm warning was extended for
the San Bernardino mountains northward, with a snow advisory for the
higher deserts of Southern California. A wind advisory issued for
the mountains of San Diego County.
   Mount Wilson, Calif., has received more than 3.5 inches of
precipitation since the storm began Thursday, most of it rain.
   A low pressure system moved across northern Minnesota toward the
Great Lakes, spreading light snow from eastern North Dakota to the
Upper Mississippi Valley. Gusty northwest winds caused blowing and
drifting snow in eastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota. Gusts
were clocked at 43 mph at Alexandria, Minn.
   Travelers to the Northeast should expect of significant snowfall
expected over the weekend from New York City through much of New
England as a storm developed along the East Coast, the weather
service said.
   Although inclement weather dominated both coasts, the nation's
midsection enjoyed mostly sunshine and clear skies Friday.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 4
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 80 degrees at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
The morning low for the nation was 18 degrees below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   Saturday's forecast called for snow throughout most of New
England and into northern parts of the Middle Atlantic Coast. Snow
also should extend from the northern and central Appalachians across
the upper Ohio Valley into the Great Lakes. Rains also should
continue over much of central and Southern California. Fog and low
cloud cover was expected over Washington and Oregon.
   High temperatures should be in the teens and 20s from the North
Atlantic Coast across the upper Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes and the
upper half of the Mississippi Valley to eastern parts of the
northern Plains. Highs should range in the single digits over
northern Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin. Highs should warm into
the 50s and 60s from Florida across the Gulf Coast, most of Texas,
southern New Mexico and the desert Southwest to most of California,
climbing into the 70s over parts of southern Florida. Elsewhere
highs in the 30s and 40s should be the rule.

<HEAD>North Carolina Indian Fugitive Freed, Returns To Reservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAMPSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indian who fled North Carolina after
he was charged with taking hostages at a newspaper was released from
jail Friday following his arrest this week stemming from a car chase
with police.
   Timothy Jacobs was freed after the National Council of Churches
posted his $25,000 bail and the Onondaga Indian Nation, on whose
reservation he had sought refuge, provided a sworn statement that it
would not harbor him should Gov. Mario Cuomo order his extradition
to face the North Carolina charges.
   Jacobs, 20, of Pembroke, N.C., was arrested Tuesday near Oneida
after a chase with police that followed a traffic violation.
   Jacobs had been staying with the Onondagas after fleeing North
Carolina last week following his indictment on kidnapping charges
for the armed takeover of the Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton,
N.C., last February.
   Jacobs will live at the reservation near Syracuse, but is not
confined there, said his attorney, Alan Rosenthal of Syracuse.
   Rosenthal said he and attorney Lewis Pitts plan to formally ask
Cuomo to deny North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin's extradition request.
He said the extradition process could take weeks or even months.
   ``The governor of North Carolina is chomping at the bits to get
him back,'' said Rosenthal.
   A Robeson County grand jury on Dec. 6 indicted Jacobs and Eddie
Hatcher, 31, also of Pembroke, on 14 counts of kidnapping for taking
20 people hostage for 10 hours.
   The two Tuscarora Indians said that taking over the newspaper was
the only way they could draw attention to what they said was
pervasive public corruption in their home county. Hatcher is free on
$25,000 bail in North Carolina.
   Jacobs has said he fled North Carolina because he feared for his
life.
   Jacobs' bail was originally set at $50,000 by Madison County
Judge William F. O'Brien. The judge reduced the bail after he
received written assurance from Onondaga Nation Chief Leon
Shenandoah that the reservation would not provide sanctuary for
Jacobs.
   The Onondagas, members of the Six Nation Iroquois Confederacy,
consider their reservation a sovereign nation, and authorities are
reluctant to enter it without the tribe's permission. The Onondagas
harbored Indian activist Dennis Banks in the early 1980s.
   Jacobs will marry his 19-year-old fiancee next week, said the
bride-to-be, Kirsten Drummond.
   Jacobs is scheduled to appear in Madison County Court on Jan. 12
to face charges stemming from the car chase with state police.

   Crime is so ferocious at the Bankhead Courts
housing project that mail carriers are protected by police escort,
the telephone company cut service calls to one day a week and a city
official warns of anarchy.
   Residents ignore an anonymous police hot line to report drug
activity and say they are too afraid to attend meetings of the
tenants association.
   ``People who live out here don't get together and try to work out
something,'' said Hattie Scales, president of the Bankhead Courts
Tenants Association. ``We can't do much at all, but they can come to
us and let us know.''
   She said Friday that ``a very few'' of the 1,703 residents who
live in the project's wood-and-brick townhouses are active in the
tenants group. A meeting Tuesday had to be called off for lack of
participation.
   ``It was at night and nobody would come out,'' Mrs. Scales said.
``I can't blame them for not coming out at night, but we haven't had
a meeting because they don't come out.''
   Postal officials suspended service to the project for one day
after shots were fired near a letter carrier Dec. 10. City officials
criticized the move, and service to the 500-unit complex resumed
Wednesday under police escort.
   Southern Bell, saying it feared for the safety of its employees,
scaled back service in Bankhead Courts, as well as to three other
complexes in the city. Telephone installation and repair work is
limited to Monday mornings, except for emergencies, and workers will
enter the projects only in groups.
   ``We've had folks flash guns and pull knives on our installers,
and threaten to use explosives on our vans,'' said Southern Bell
spokesman Doug Kendig.
   Gene Parker, another Southern Bell spokesman, said the safeguards
are temporary, and company officials were meeting with police and
city officials in an effort to strike a compromise.
   Mayor Andrew Young condemned the decision as ``another attempt to
make poor people pay for the cutbacks in services.''
   Atlanta Housing Authority spokeswoman Cynthia Hoke said in a
statement that the authority was ``outraged'' by the phone service
cutback, effective about two weeks ago.
   ``We will not stand idly by and allow others to alienate our
communities,'' Ms. Hoke said. ``AHA leadership will employ all means
necessary, including legal actions, to ensure the delivery of
utility and governmental services to citizens who happen to live in
public housing.''
   City Council President Marvin Arrington, who warned residents to
take more responsibility, said Southern Bell's action was ``exactly
the point I was making'' about conditions at the project.
   ``Can you imagine if services are terminated, what would
happen?'' Arrington asked. ``It would become an enclave unto itself,
and I don't want to see that happen.
   ``If there is anarchy, if there is no control and no respect for
police officers, the foundation of that community gives way,'' he
said. ``We need to go in ... and say, `Hold on. We're trying to help
you live a better quality of life.'''
   The service restrictions were the latest setbacks at Bankhead
Courts, which sits in a wooded area of northwest Atlanta next to an
industrial park. Police say the project has been prone to violent
incidents and drug-related crimes for most of its 19 years.
   On Nov. 3, a 24-year-old woman who journeyed into the complex
with friends was killed when a drug dealer, fearing undercover
police officers, opened fire on her car as it approached with its
headlights off.
   Two days later, four police officers were injured during several
scuffles that erupted during a drug sweep. Twelve residents of the
complex were arrested on drug charges.
   A Nov. 10 raid by 37 officers led to 27 arrests _ nine on drug
charges and 18 for traffic violations and other charges.
   ``We have to change this system around,'' Mrs. Scales said.
``That's about the only way. If we don't get something decent going,
we can't expect nothing but the bottom.''
   In an incident at a Chicago housing project Monday, paramedics
responding to an emergency call from the mother of an asthmatic
child refused to enter the building after they said they were pelted
with rocks and eggs.
   The mother of the 9-year-old filed a $60 million lawsuit against
the city Wednesday. The boy's mother and neighbors insist there was
no danger to the paramedics, that nothing had been thrown.

<TEXT>
   One of California's main interstate highways
reopened Friday, but conditions were messy following a winter storm
that stranded motorists, caused as many as 50 trucks to jackknife
and was blamed for at least two deaths.
   Also Friday, hurricane-force winds abated in Northern California,
where power was knocked out to more than 575,000 electric customers
and at least three children died.
   The California Highway Patrol began escorting cars over the
summit of Interstate 5 on the 4,500-foot Tejon Pass north of Los
Angeles, but sleet continued to force intermittent closings along
the heavily traveled north-south route. No injuries were reported.
   The National Weather Service forecast continuing rain, with snow
in the mountains.
   Traffic on Interstate 15 through the 4,400-foot Cajon Pass 55
miles east of Los Angeles moved faster when snow and wind subsided,
authorities said.
   Two people were killed early Thursday in the numerous accidents
that occurred when the storm descended on Cajon Pass, a major route
between Southern California and Arizona.
   On the central coast, Highway 101 in San Luis Obispo County was
reopened for drivers who were stuck on each side of icy Cuesta Grade
since Thursday.
   Motorists filled up motels and inns Thursday night when traffic
ground to a halt on Highway 101 because of a rare snowfall.
   Shelters prepared for another night of providing for the
homeless. Hotel vouchers were handed out in Los Angeles and a
recreation center and armory were opened. Two armories opened in
Orange County.
   Some snow-starved Southern Californians abandoned work and headed
for the ski slopes, said resort operators at Big Bear Lake in the
San Bernardino Mountains and at Wrightwood in the San Gabriel
Mountains.
   ``It's snowing like crazy up here, we're just having a ball,''
said Richard Conger, spokesman for the Mountain High ski spot at
Wrightwood.
   In Northern California, residents and authorities began to clean
up in the wake of the ferocious north winds that damaged boats and
airplanes, downed power lines and trees and fanned dozens of brush
fires.
   In an affluent Santa Rosa neighborhood, nine homes were destroyed
or badly damaged by fire and three mobile homes were badly damaged
by trees.
   ``I felt like I was in an earthquake all night. When I went
outside to prop up a fence, the wind literally picked me up off the
ground. I mean, I was airborne,'' said LoMae Mathis in Sonoma, about
30 miles north of San Francisco, recalling the winds that began
Wednesday night.
   The high winds, which gusted to 102 mph atop Mount Diablo,
knocked out power to homes in northern and central California.
   Oli Asghar, 3, died in a Berkeley apartment fire Thursday that
was sparked by a candle. His parents and three brothers and sisters
were left homeless, fire officials said.
   In Pittsburg, 30 miles north, 6-year-old Mounkoun Lee died late
Wednesday night of smoke inhalation after being trapped inside his
family's burning home. His 5-year-old sister, Angela, died at
Children's Hospital Thursday night.

   The Fernald uranium-processing plant repeatedly
contaminated its environs with radioactive materials and violated
pollution laws in three decades of operation, its neighbors told a
federal judge Friday.
   The neighbors are suing the Department of Energy plant's former
operators, National Lead of Ohio Inc. and its parent company,
National Lead Industries, in a $300 million class action.
   Their chief lawyer, Stanley Chesley, on Friday asked U.S.
District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel to issue a summary judgment in
favor of the plaintiffs. An Energy Department lawyer representing
National Lead argued that a summary judgment _ a judge's ruling
based on the evidence already presented without further proceedings
_ should be issued in favor of the company.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio took over operation of the
37-year-old plant from National Lead, the facility's only previous
operator, on Jan. 1, 1986.
   The plant dumped radioactive radium and uranium daily into the
Great Miami River which flows by the 1,050-acre site, often
exceeding its stated desire to limit the uranium dumping to 36
pounds daily in the 1950s, said Chesley and his assistant, Louise
Roselle.
   The Great Miami aquifer, an underground regional water extending
southward from Dayton to Hamilton, Ohio, flows under the plant, and
there is evidence of radioactive ground water contamination at the
plant site, Chesley said.
   The plaintiffs' attorneys also said they have evidence to show
that the plant has subjected residents to excessive daily doses of
radiation and has failed to qualify for federal Clean Air Act
operating permits since 1984.
   Chesley told the court he has documents indicating that the
government apparently lied when it told residents in the past that
the plant was not contaminating the environment.
   But Energy Department lawyer Marc Johnston said the department
found that National Lead did not violate its contract with the
government in running the plant. That is critical, he argued,
because Congress exempted Energy Department facilities from the laws
that the neighbors cite and instead left it up to the Energy
Department to regulate its own facilities.
   ``We do not dispute that there were emissions of various
materials from that plant, including uranium,'' Johnston said. ``We
do deny that there were hazardous conditions created.''
   The Energy Department admitted in 1985 that the plant had
released an estimated 300,000 pounds of uranium oxide dust into the
atmosphere through faulty exhaust-air filter systems during three
decades of operations.
   The Energy Department is representing National Lead of Ohio and
its parent because they ultimately were told by the government how
to operate the plant, Johnston said. The government is not a
defendant in the lawsuit.
   Johnston also said he was challenging Spiegel's previous decision
to grant class-action status to the lawsuit.
   He argued that National Lead cannot be found liable because it
was following the government's orders to run the plant, and an
Energy Department contract enforcement officer concluded that the
company had carried out its responsibilities.
   Chesley introduced in court a January 1985 letter by Joe LaGrone,
an Energy Department manager who oversees the plant from Oak Ridge,
Tenn., to National Lead Industries of Hightstown, N.J.
   LaGrone said in the letter that he found National Lead of Ohio's
performance unsatisfactory in production operations, health, safety
and fire requirements, environmental management and budget
administration.
   The Energy Department penalized the company by subtracting more
than $1 million from its contract payments, Chesley said. ``It
certainly belies that this company was in compliance,'' Chesley said
of the letter.
   The judge ended the court session by saying he was taking the
case under review and would try to issue his ruling soon.
   Because of Spiegel's previous decision to certify the lawsuit as
a class-action, it represents 14,000 people living within five miles
of the plant, formally known as the Feed Materials Production
Center, which has operated since 1951 and processes uranium for the
government's production elsewhere of nuclear weapons.
   Production at the plant has been halted since Oct. 7 because of a
strike by workers who are to vote Saturday on a tentative contract.
   The neighbors allege the plant contaminated the environs 18 miles
northwest of Cincinnati, polluting air, water and land and
subjecting neighbors to excessive radiation exposure. They say they
are due damages for emotional distress, exposure-caused health
impairments and reduced property values caused by the plant's
proximity.
   Chesley cited a series of presidential executive orders since
1948 that he said required federal agencies to work with state and
local agencies to avoid pollution and to comply with environmental
laws unless the president grants specific exemptions because of
national security. No president has granted any such exemption for
the Fernald plant, he said.
   The state of Ohio on Dec. 2 reached a court-approved settlement
with the Energy Department granting the state environmental
supervision of hazardous wastes at the plant. Ohio officials said
the agreement will allow the state to police the federal cleanup of
the site.
   But Chesley said the agreement does not commit the federal
government to the cleanup and does not give Ohio regulatory power
over radioactive wastes stored at the plant. Radioactive wastes are
regulated separately from hazardous materials.

<HEAD>Former East German Spy Chief Gives First Western Interview</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Markus ``Misha'' Wolf, the famed
East German spymaster who resigned unexpectedly last year, denounced
Stalinism in his first interview with a Western author, the author
said Friday.
   Wolf, 65, was not asked about his espionage activity for the
communist state in the interview, author Henning Mueller said.
   But he said the former intelligence chief, whose agents' activity
triggered the fall of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1974,
talked at length about the terror of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's
rule.
   Mueller used the interview as material for a book on Wolf's
father Friedrich, a well-known Jewish doctor and dramatist. He said
he conducted the interview earlier year in East Berlin, after
applying to East Germany's Academy of Arts for permission.
   ``It went without any problems. I applied to the academy and
received permission,'' Mueller said in a telephone interview. ``I
believe this is the first and only interview Wolf gave to a Western
author.''
   Mueller said Wolf talked at length about his family's stay in the
Soviet Union during Stalin's rule and made strong statements against
him.
   Excerpts of the interview were published Friday by the
Frankfurter Rundschau, a left-leaning newspaper, and their contents
were confirmed by Mueller.
   In the brief excerpts, Wolf spoke of his family and ``experiences
of sorrow and repression'' under Stalin's dictatorship in the Soviet
Union.
   ``Our parents were deeply moved by the fate of many friends and
acquaintances that were hit by (Stalin's) repressions,'' Wolf was
quoted as saying.
   ``Despotism and injustice don't really go together well with the
ideals of the October revolution,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The newspaper said similar anti-Stalin statements made by Wolf in
a documentary film for East German television apparently led
authorities to put the film into archives without ever showing it.
The film is about Wolf's family.
   East Germany recently banned the distribution of a Soviet
magazine which has been publishing frank accounts of Stalin's terror.
   The communist state has resisted following economic and political
reforms started by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Wolf's father was a Communist and fled with his wife and two sons
from Nazi Germany. The family first went to Switzerland and France
and in 1934 settled in the Soviet Union.
   Markus Wolf, born in 1923 near Stuttgart, lived in the Soviet
Union until 1945, when he returned to the Soviet-occupied zone of
defeated Germany.
   For six years he worked as a diplomat and journalist, then
entered East Germany's intelligence organization in 1951 and became
its director in 1958.
   He built up a formidable network of agents, focusing primarily on
West Germany.
   For decades, Wolf was known to Western intelligence agencies only
as the ``Man Without A Face.'' His last known photograph dated back
to 1959, until a Western intelligence agent took another shot in
1982 when Wolf attended the funeral of his brother Konrad.
   Wolf gained notoriety in the West after the 1974 exposure of
Guenther Guillaume, a senior adviser to then-West German Chancellor
Brandt, as an East German spy. The arrest of Guillaume, Wolf's top
agent, led to Brandt's resignation.
   Wolf's retirement in February 1987 took West German government
and security officials by surprise. The official East German news
agency ADN said Wolf was leaving office ``at his own wish.''

   U.S. Rep. William Chappell, who lost his
bid for re-election by 791 votes in the Nov. 8 general election,
formally conceded Friday.
   Republican newcomer Craig James, a DeLand attorney, defeated the
10-term Democrat by a margin of less than 1 percent of the 250,000
votes cast in the northeast Florida district.
   ``I must acknowledge the Republican Party has won the seat in the
4th Congressional District of Florida, and I have decided against
pursuing a challenge any further,'' said Chappell, whose campaign
was dogged by reports linking him to investigations of the Pentagon
procurement scandal. He has not been charged in any defense
contractor investigations.
   James was not immediately available for comment; a message was
left on his home answering machine.
   Chappell, 66, of Daytona Beach Shores, sought to have the state
Supreme Court throw out nearly 11,000 votes from Flagler County, but
the court turned back his request Nov. 30.
   The Flagler County results reached the state division of
elections office one day after a seven-day state deadline. If
results from that county had been thrown out, Chappell would have
won the race by 229 votes.
   In addition to his 20 years in Washington, Chappell served in the
Florida House of Representatives for 10 years and was its speaker in
1961. He was prosecuting attorney in Marion County between 1949 and
1954.

<HEAD>Head of US Disaster Team Says Distribution of Supplies is Key
Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a U.S. government delegation to the
earthquake zone of Soviet Armenia returned home Friday saying
distribution of relief supplies is the major concern there now.
   Julia Taft, director of the Agency for International
Development's office of foreign disaster assistance, said she would
meet with President Reagan on Monday and recommend more U.S.
assistance to meet the immediate needs of housing, shelter and
storage facilities.
   ``The major concern that we see is one of logistics _ how we can
facilitate the reception, sorting out and distribution of the kinds
of commodities that have gone in,'' she said.
   ``The U.S. government has sent in tents and blankets and plastic
sheeting and medical supplies. Much of that has gotten out but there
still are warehouses full,'' she said. ``... There just isn't enough
space. And there aren't enough buses and trucks to get it out to the
villages. And some of the villages are inaccessible at this point.''
   Taft spoke upon her arrival at Washington Dulles Airport in
suburban Virginia on Friday night, one week after she and a team of
46 U.S. disaster relief workers, doctors, emergency experts and
Armenian officials left for the earthquake-stricken region of the
Soviet Union.
   She said no more medical supplies should be sent to the region.
She said the way individual Americans can best help is by donating
money to assistance funds.
   The U.S. government has donated $1.8 million in assistance, she
said, and private U.S. efforts have contributed another $5 million.
Efforts in Armenia, she said, are now shifting from emergency
efforts to more long-term assistance for individuals left homeless
or without family members.
   The U.S. team was greeted warmly and emotionally as team members
personally delivered masks and gloves and other emergency supplies
to survivors, she said. Many of the team members remained in the
Soviet Union and will stay beyond Christmas.
   ``It's so cold there. It's snowing and it's bitter,'' she said.
   ``Almost every local Armenian in the cities is shellshocked,''
she said. ``It looks like a war zone. These people are stunned.
They're living next to hovels that were their homes. ... They are
sitting by fires at night, waiting to hear the voice of a loved one
buried. During the day, they are in the rubble, digging.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.
opened historic talks with the PLO on Friday, and both sides said
they hoped the dialogue would lead to a comprehensive Middle East
peace.
   The meeting, coming just two days after Washington reversed a
longstanding policy of refusing to deal with the Palestine
Liberation Organization inspired hope in many quarters that the
Middle East peace process soon will become more than just an empty
phrase.
   ``Our discussions were very practical and characterized, I would
say, by seriousness of purpose,'' Pelletreau told reporters after
the 90-minute meeting with a four-man PLO delegation led by Yasser
Abd-Rabbou, a member of the group's executive committee.
   The ambassador implied there would be other meetings but did not
say when. Abd-Rabbou said the next session probably would come in
the next few weeks.
   ``It is our hope that this dialogue, as it develops, will help
bring about direct negotiations that will lead to comprehensive
peace,'' said Pelletreau, who was accompanied to the talks by Edmund
Hull, political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis.
   Each side made separate statements to reporters after the meeting
at Dar Maghrebia, an official Tunisian government guest residence in
Carthage, a suburb just north of Tunis. Neither side gave
substantive details of the talks.
   ``We hope the application of this change in the policy of the
United States will be practiced through a real pressure on Israel in
order to change the policy of occupation, the policy of terrorism,
the policy of oppression against our Palestinian people,'' said
Abd-Rabbou.
   U.S. officials have emphasized the new contacts are merely a
``dialogue'' and do not represent real peace negotiations. The PLO
says it does not see the distinction.
   ``We don't see any difference between dialogue and talks and
negotiations,'' said Abd-Rabbou, a member of the Marxist Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine and director of the PLO's
Information Deparment. In Washington, State Department spokesman
Charles E. Redman declined to comment on Abd-Rabbou's statement.
Redman said he did not know when the next meeting would be held.
   Abd-Rabbou said the Palestinian delegation represented the PLO
executive committee, which in turn was ``assuming the role of the
provisional government of Palestine.''
   Last month the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament
in exile, proclaimed an independent Palestinian state. The borders
were not specified.
   After a news conference by PLO chief Yasser Arafat on Wednesday,
the United States announced that the organization had met conditions
for the start of a dialogue by clearly recognizing Israel and
renouncing terrorism.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz designated Pelletreau, 53, as
Washington's only authorized channel for dealing with the PLO,
apparently hoping to avoid back-door contacts.
   Western diplomatic sources, speaking on condition that they not
be identified further, said the first priority of the U.S. side
would be making clear Washington's attitude on terrorism.
   The sources said that while the United States was aware the PLO
could not be held responsible for all acts of terrorism, it would
expect the group to dissassociate itself clearly from any future
terrorist attack.
   The second U.S. priority, the sources added, was a general
explanation of Washington's position on Middle East peace.
   Substantive talks, the sources said, most likely would have to
wait until President-elect George Bush takes over next month.
   The PLO delegation to the talks included Abd-Rabbou; Hakim
Balawi, the PLO's permanent representative to Tunisia and a member
of Arafat's Fatah guerrilla group, the largest of the nine groups
under the PLO umbrella.
   Also in the delegation were Abdullah Hourani, an independent
member of the PLO executive committee; and Abdellatif Abu Hajlah, a
Fatah member and director-general of the PLO political department.
   The delegations conducted their talks across two tables placed
face-to-face under a huge crystal chandelier in a large blue room of
the guest house. On a marble-top table off to one side stood small
U.S. and Palestinian flags.
   Abd-Rabbou credited the year-old uprising in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip for the present talks.
   ``We are here in the name of the intefadeh (uprising),'' he said.
``We will continue our efforts to achieve the goals of the
intefadeh.'' More than 320 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been
killed in the uprising.

   The Common Market chose Frans
Andriessen, a former Dutch finance minister, on Friday as its chief
of foreign and trade policy, the official who deals with other
countries.
   Andriessen now has the agricultural portfolio. He succeeds Willy
De Clercq, who guided the 12-nation European Economic Community
through sometimes stormy trade relations with the United States.
   The appointment, for a two-year term beginning Jan. 6, was one of
17 announced Friday to the European Commission, the EEC executive
branch.
   Jacques Delors, commission president, remains in charge of
monetary affairs, an increasingly important job as member nations
work toward a common monetary policy and decide whether they need a
European central bank.
   Another appointment was of Martin Bangemann, former West German
economics minister, to be in charge of the internal market with the
goal of creating a single marketplace free of barriers by the end of
1992.
   Ray MacSharry of Ireland replaces Andriessen as chief of
agricultural affairs, an area including the subsidy policy that has
provoked sharp protest by the United States. A dispute with
Washington over certain farm subsidies has stalled international
trade negotiations.
   Nine of the 17 commissioners are new to the EEC executive and the
others are changing jobs.

<HEAD>Court Allows Drug Testing of Presidential Appointees, Drug Handlers

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court
Friday said a temporary injunction blocking a Justice Department
random drug testing program should not extend to presidential
appointees in the Justice Department or to employees there whose job
is to handle drugs.
   A two-paragraph order from the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
noted that none of the Justice Department lawyers challenging the
drug-testing program is a presidential appointee or someone who
maintains, stores or safeguards drugs as part of their work.
   Therefore, said the order, the lawyers challenging the program
``lack standing'' to include those two categories of Justice
Department personnel.
   The order affects only a small number of the 4,700 Justice
Department empoyees who would be included in a mandatory random
drug-testing program, fewer than 20 presidential appointees and a
somewhat larger number in the other category.
   The drug testing program had not been put in effect when it was
challenged last summer.
   A Justice Department spokeswoman, Amy Brown, said ``the practical
impact of the order seems to be'' that testing could proceed for
those two small categories of employees if the department decided to
issue 30-day notices informing those two groups that they could face
testing after one month.
   The appeals court remanded the case to U.S. District Court to
excise those two categories from the preliminary injunction and
return the case to the appeals court for further consideration.
   U.S. District Judge George Revercomb found that testing without
any suspicion of drug use by the individual is an unconstitutional
invasion of privacy.

   A federal appeals court that twice
blocked the death of double murderer Gerald Smith refused Friday to
stop Smith's latest scheduled execution, set for 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled 7-3 to
deny a petition filed by Smith's wife that sought to reopen the case.
   Lynn Smith's request cited a recent newspaper article that raised
doubts about Smith's guilt.
   The court rejected the request without comment.
   The ruling apparently leaves it to the U.S. Supreme Court or to
Smith to stop the execution, which would be the first in Missouri
since 1965.
   Smith has ordered appeals dropped and on Friday, prison officials
said he appeared ``committed to carrying through with it.''
   Smith, 30, is sentenced to die for two unrelated murders. He
faces death warrants for the 1980 murder of Karen Roberts and the
1985 stabbing death of fellow death row inmate Robert Baker.

   The administrative assistant to Sen.
Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., earned $99,000 while on a paid leave of
absence to help Florida Democrats in state legislative races, a
newspaper reported Friday.
   Charles E. Canady earned the money for five months of work as
campaign chairman of the Florida House Leadership Council while
continuing to draw his full $85,000-a-year Senate salary, the St.
Petersburg Times reported.
   Chiles said Canady had accumulated enormous amounts of
compensatory time and unused vacation and holidays during his 18
years on the senator's staff.
   ``So when Charles wanted to get involved actively with the House
Leadership Council during the campaign season, I agreed he should be
compensated for all the extra time he had applied in his Senate
job,'' Chiles said in a statement.
   Canady continued to consult with Chiles' staff when needed during
his paid leave, the senator said.
   ``I took (the paid leave) with the senator's approval,'' said
Canady, 55. ``Instead of taking a long vacation, I decided to work
with the House Leadership Council.''
   Senate rules do not prohibit staff members from carrying vacation
time from one year to another.
   ``It's left up to the individual senator's discretion,'' said
Timothy S. Wineman, assistant financial clerk in the Office of the
Secretary of the U.S. Senate.
   Chiles did not seek re-election this year and will leave office
next month. His seat was won by Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen on Friday kidnapped three Irish
soldiers serving with the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon
and demanded the release of a guerrilla leader abducted by Israel,
police said.
   In other developments Friday:
   _Peter Winkler, a Swiss official of the International Committee
of the Red Cross who was kidnapped on Nov. 17, was released in the
southern city of Sidon. He said he did not know who kidnapped him.
Voice of Lebanon radio said Winkler was released by the
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the guerrilla group headed by
Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.
   _Police said eight fighters were killed and four wounded in Sidon
when the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia fought guerrillas of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Friday's abduction was the second time in less than 24 hours that
Lebanese gunmen captured Irish troops to retaliate for Israel's
seizure of Jawad Kasfi.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said its soldiers in south Lebanon
seized Kasfi, another senior local guerrilla commander and two other
guerrilla suspects in the village of Tibnin on Thursday.
   Police said four gunmen in two cars seized the three Irish
soldiers in Tibnin on Friday, bundled them into a white Mercedes and
sped away. The village borders on Israel's self-proclaimed security
zone.
   Lebanese police said on condition of anonymity that the
kidnappers demanded that the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, with
which the three Irish soldiers served, negotiate with Israel for the
release of the four guerrilla suspects.
   UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel said the U.N. force has not
negotiated with Israel so far.
   ``They (Israel) acknowledged that they are holding these people.
This was our only official contact,'' Goksel said. ``Of course,
there was a very strong protest from UNIFIL because it was an
infringement on UNIFIL zone. But we got no response to that.''
   The Israeli army identified Kasfi as a leader of the Religious
Resistance Front headed by Mustafa Dirani, a splinter faction of
Amal.
   The faction is affiliated with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, a fundamentalist movement at odds with Amal.
   The military command said Kasfi was suspected of organizing and
participating in kidnappings and dozens of attacks against Israeli
army forces and the allied South Lebanon Army militia since 1984.
   ``The suspects are undergoing interrogation,'' the army said in a
statement. ``Those ... found innocent of attacks will be released.''
   Kasfi was abducted by two Israeli soldiers and three South
Lebanon Army men who drove into Tibnin in civilian cars, Lebanese
police said. A spokesman made no mention of other captives.
   Goksel said U.N. peacekeeping troops, backed by Amal militiamen,
would keep searching in the area until the missing men are found.
   Tibnin is 15 miles north of the Israeli border in the U.N.
force's zone of operations.
   The zone patrolled by the nine-nation U.N. force overlaps the
Israeli security belt, which is six to 10 miles deep and runs from
the Mediterranean to the foothills of mount Hermon. It is designed
to curb cross-border guerrilla raids.
   U.N. troops ``blocked all roads in its area of operations ... in
an effort to prevent the gunmen from smuggling the three Irish
soldiers out of south Lebanon,'' a police spokesman said.
   Amal, which regularly cooperates with the U.N. force,
``threatened to crack down on the kidnappers ``if the three soldiers
were not released by nightfall,'' the spokesman said.
   Asked after sundown whether Amal had taken direct action to
rescue the Irishmen, he said: ``No. Apparently they are still
considering giving peaceful efforts a chance.''
   He declined to say to which group the kidnappers belonged, but
said they are known to Amal, the U.N. force and police.
   Three other Irish UNIFIL soldiers were seized on Thursday by
armed residents of Tibnin in retaliation for the kidnapping.
   But they were released an hour later when Amal promised villagers
that the U.N. force would seek to locate Kasfi and bring him back.
   The afternoon clashes at Sidon were touched off when two
Palestinians were killed by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Amal
gunners near the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp, police said.
   The battles with mortars, grenades and machine guns raged after
nightfall on Sidon's southern outskirts, triggering fears of a major
confrontation that would negate a 20-month-old Syrian-brokered truce.
   Amal fought a two-year war with the Palestinians before the truce
took hold. More than 1,500 people were killed and 3,500 wounded in
the fighting, in which Syrian-backed Amal tried to prevent PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat from rebuilding the Lebanon power base he
lost in Israel's 1982 invasion.

<HEAD>Government Drops Out Of Collusive Pricing Suit Against Hughes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to withdraw from a
lawsuit alleging that Hughes Helicopter Co. engaged in collusive
pricing on parts used to produce the Army's Apache helicopter, the
Justice Department announced Friday.
   The department said there was insufficient evidence to
demonstrate that the government was damaged in connection with
allegations of collusive pricing on parts provided by Parker
Hannifin Corp.'s Bertea Controls Division of Los Angeles for use in
the Apache.
   The allegations were contained in a private lawsuit filed by a
former Hughes employee, Roderick Stillwell.
   The suit also alleged that Hughes submitted false requests for
reimbursement of tooling charges incurred on the Parker subcontract.
   The government joined the suit, which was filed in March 1987 in
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, but it withdrew after conducting
an extensive investigation, Assistant Attorney General John Bolton
said in a statement.
   The investigation included the informal discovery and audit of
thousands of documents provided by Parker Hannifin and by McDonnell
Douglas Corp., which owns Hughes Aircraft.

<HEAD>Penal Code Revisions Lists Capital Crimes, Allows Holding In
Isolation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed revision of the Soviet penal code says
convicts may be executed for crimes ranging from treason to rape and
allows authorities to hold people under arrest in isolation,
official media said Friday.
   The two-page draft revision, the first result of a long-promised
change in the criminal laws, appeared in the government newspaper
Izvestia.
   The draft apparently does not deal with the two sections of the
penal code most criticized by Western human rights activists. The
code now allows authorities to imprison people on charges of
anti-Soviet slander and anti-Soviet agitation.
   The proposed revision has been submitted to the two houses of the
Supreme Soviet, or parliament, for discussion. The deputies were
asked to submit their conclusions to the Presidium, or chief
executive body of parliament, by March 15, the official news agency
Tass said.
   One new section would permit authorities to keep people under
arrest in isolation for one to three months, with the exception of
women who are pregnant or have children under the age of eight.
   A series of crimes which are not included in the current code and
which would be punishable by death ``under extraordinary
circumstances'' are listed in the draft. The draft does not say what
the circumstances would be.
   Betrayal of the state, spying, terrorist acts, sabotage,
premeditated murder under aggravating cirumstances, and rape of
minors could be punishable by death.
   Under the provisions of the draft, the death sentence could not
be applied to people under the age of 18 and over the age of 60.
   Although the revised code is more severe concerning arrest and
capital punishment, certain punishments have been dropped.
   Exile and deportation, two measures that prohibit a person from
living in certain cities, are not included in the draft. Under
current law, the two measures are listed under ``types of
punishment.''
   In the past, dissidents often were exiled or deported as part of
their sentence, helping to fragment the dissident movement.

   About 100 leftist guerrillas on
Friday attacked an eastern army battalion in an operation that
included sabotage of power lines and gasoline stations, officials
said.
   At least four guerrillas were killed. The army said one soldier
and three civilians were wounded.
   Guerrillas coordinated the mortar and rifle attack on the
headquarters of the Atonal army battalion in Usulutan, 70 miles east
of San Salvador, with sabotage in central El Salvador that left most
of the capital without electricity for much of Friday.
   Capt. Mario Miranda, spokesman for the 6th army brigade based in
Usulutan, told said in a telephone interview that the fighting began
about midnight and lasted for two hours.
   Miranda said at least two guerrilla groups, of 60 and 40
combatants, fired mortars and rifles at the Atonal base in a
``harassment'' action. No rebel mortars fell inside the compound, he
said.
   Troops from the 6th brigade and the Atonal battalion and national
and treasury Police repelled the attackers, he said.
   The guerrillas also used explosives to partially destroy two
gasoline stations and blow up five utility transmission poles,
Miranda said.
   The sabotage left the entire province of Usulutan and parts of
San Miguel and La Union provinces without electricty for several
hours.
   Officers permitted reporters to photograph the four slain rebels
but refused to permit access to the battalion base to survey
possible damage.

   Kidnappers on Friday released Peter
Winkler, a Swiss official of the International Committee of the Red
Cross, and he said of his captivity, ``I've never known that four
weeks can be as long as that.''
   Winkler spoke to journalists as he was driven from Sidon to a
Syrian command post in Rmeileh, six miles north of this southern
port.
   He flashed the V for victory sign as he posed jovially for news
photographers in front of a portrait of Syrian President Hafez Assad
in Rmeileh.
   Asked if he will resume his Red Cross work in Lebanon, Winkler
said: ``I'm afraid I will have to leave Lebanon soon. ... My
enthusiasm has suffered.''
   Police sources said Winkler would be taken to Damascus, Syria,
before he flies home Saturday. But ICRC sources in Beirut said he
would be be taken to Swiss Ambassador Dino Sciolli in Christian east
Beirut. There was no explanation for the discrepancy. All sources
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Also Friday, gunmen in south Lebanon abducted three Irish
soldiers of the U.N. peacekeeping force and demanded the release of
a guerrilla leader abducted by Israel, police said. Three other
Irish U.N. soldiers were briefly held by armed residents Thursday
for the same reason.
   Winkler, 32, was freed at 9 p.m. at Hisbeh Square in Sidon,
Lebanon's third-largest city, the same spot where he was abducted
Nov. 17.
   He was in high spirits, cleanshaven and looked fit, with no sign
of physical torture or maltreatment. ``I have shaved off the beard
I've grown in captivity today,'' he said.
   The leftist Nasserite Popular Organization militia, which has
been ruling Sidon since the 1975 outbreak of Lebanon's civil war,
took delivery of Winkler upon his release.
   He was turned over to the Swedish ambassador to Syria and
Lebanon, Rolf Gauffin, who took Winkler in his black Volvo to
Rmeileh and then to Beirut. A carload of Syrian secret service men
escorted the freed hostage on the 25-mile trip from Sidon to the
Lebanese capital.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station said
Winkler was released by the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the
guerrilla group headed by Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.
   The police spokesman quoted Winkler as telling the militia's
chief of staff, Usama Saad, he did not know the identity of those
who held him.
   ``I was held in a small room all the time, with only one jailer
entering to bring in meals,'' police quoted Winkler as telling Saad.
   ``But whenever others came in to talk to me the jailer used to
blindfold me. These people told me time and again that I was being
held to guarantee that Hussein Hariri will be treated well in
Switzerland.''
   Hariri, 22, a Shiite Moslem Lebanese, is scheduled to go on trial
in Geneva on Feb. 20 on charges of hijacking an Air Afrique jetliner
on July 14, 1987 and forcing it to land at Geneva airport. He is
accused of killing a French passenger before he was overpowered and
arrested.
   On his way to Beirut, Winkler told The Associated Press he
thought his kidnappers made a mistake by seizing him.
   ``Then I was really shocked when I found myself in a cell. I was
chained to the wall and had this little bed to lie on, a few
blankets, no light. Well, I thought, Merry Christmas.''
   ``I tried not to feel too much throughout all those four weeks,''
Winkler said. ``It just hurt most of the time.''
   He said he was served three meals a day throughout _ mostly
chicken sandwiches initially ``which caused me a lot of
indigestion.''
   After he complained, ``I got vegetables, eggs in the morning,
bread, sometimes soup. I asked for fruit and I got bananas and
mandarines. I got tea, Pepsi, and well, I really have to admit I was
well-treated.''
   He said he had a radio for a while and then TV and was allowed
Lebanese French-language weeklies.
   ``I missed most the wind in my hair, the sun, the sky, things
like that. It was liberty that I also missed, to do what I wanted to
do,'' Winkler said.
   He confirmed that he wrote a note, delivered by the kidnappers
Dec. 2, which said he was kidnapped because he was a Swiss citizen
and not an ICRC official.
   ``I really believed that,'' he said.
   Red Cross officials had been in continuous contact with Lebanese
and Palestinian factions in a bid to gain Winkler's release. Earlier
Friday, the Red Cross addressed an open letter to Winkler and said
it would not rest until he gained his freedom.
   Not including the three Irishmen, 14 foreigners are still held
hostage in Lebanon _ nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman and
an Italian. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest held. He was kidnapped on March 16,
1985.
   The Nasserite Popular Organization, one of several pro-Nasser
groups in Lebanon, cooperates with Palestinian guerrillas. It is a
largely Sunni Moslem outfit. Its area of control is restricted to
Sidon.

   The government has allocated $50,000 to house
hundreds of families left homeless in an eastern province from the
earthquake that devastated nearby Soviet Armenia, the provincial
governor said Friday.
   Four people were killed in the region in the Dec. 7 quake.
   Gov. Hasan Pakir of Kars province said 560 families were left
homeless in Akyaka and Arpacay townships on the border with the
Soviet Union. He did not give an exact number of people.
   New houses for those families will be finished by the end of
1989, Pakir said in an interview. The families will spend the winter
in makeshift homes they built for themselves using logs provided by
the state, he said.
   The area affected by the quake is dotted with mountain villages
in which many people live in homes of mud brick.
   Relief workers have set up 1,909 tents, issued 3,000 blankets and
distributed three tons of food to the victims, Pakir added.
   The governor said financial aid will be made available to those
whose houses were slightly damaged in the quake.
   Most of eastern Turkey lies on the Anatolian fault and the area
has been hit often by temblors.
   Last week's quake killed an estimated 55,000 people in Soviet
Armenia.
   An earthquake in 1983 killed 3,000 people in the Turkish
provinces of Kars and Erzurum. Another quake killed 30,000 in the
eastern province of Erzincan in 1939.

<HEAD>Archbishop Says Catholic University Never Defined Faculty's
Academic Freedom</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops with 10 grafs to include Cardinal Bernardin testimony,
edits appropriately</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANITA WOMACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former chairman of the board of trustees of
Catholic University testified Friday that the faculty's academic
freedoms were never clearly spelled out and therefore are not
binding on the administration.
   ``The board never defined academic freedom,'' said Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin. ``Unless they approved a statement, it is not
binding,'' said Bernardin, currently archbishop of Chicago.
   Court papers revealed that in July 1968, the Board of Trustees
adopted a statement ensuring academic freedom at the university.
   Lawyers for the Rev. Charles E. Curran are seeking to prove that
when Catholic University revoked his right to teach theology,
university officials violated his academic freedom.
   The non-jury trial included the testimony of two of the church's
highest officials in the country.
   Curran, 54, is an ordained priest, whose disagreement with church
teachings on homosexuality, birth control and other positions were
pubished in his book ``Faithful Dissent.'' Afterward Vatican
officials revoked Curran's ``canonical mission'' to teach Catholic
theology.
   Cardinal James A. Hickey, archibishop of Washington and
chancellor of the university, Thursday testified that the church had
the authority to decide when an ordained priest no longer spoke for
the church.
   When the Vatican revoked his priviledges, Curran was suspended by
Hickey.
   Catholic University was founded in 1885 as one of a few
``pontifical universities'' directly governed by the church.
   Bernardin testified the university risked severing its
relationship with the church if it had not suspended Curran.
   ``If we were to directly defy the Holy See,'' the school risked
having its charter revoked, he said.
   Monsignor Frederick McManus, a Catholic University canon law
professor and the principal author of the Canonical Statutes, said
Hickey, played an ``honorific'' role as chancellor of the school and
did not have the authority to decide who should or should not teach
there.
   Curran's lawyers, arguing the case before Superior Court Judge
Frederick H. Weisberg, were trying to refute Hickey's testimony on
Thursday that he, as a representative of the Vatican, had the right
to suspend Curran.
   Curran sued the university after it revoked his right to teach
theology on the grounds that his writings were at odds with the
church. Curran had refused an offer to teach ethics outside of the
university's religious department. He had taught at the school for
22 years.
   Hickey, archbishop of Washington, said he merely was enforcing
the highest order of the church to suspend Curran after the Vatican
revoked his right to teach Roman Catholic theology.
   The university claims Curran must obey the revocation of his
mission to teach. However, Curran counters that he never had such a
mission and his contract is the same as other tenured professors at
the university.
   Curran's attorney, Paul Saunders, is seeking to prove that Curran
had no knowledge of his canonical mission, and that Hickey's
suspension of Curran was not sanctioned by canon law.
   Following his 1987 suspension, Curran served as a visiting
professor at Cornell. He now has a one-year appointment at the
University of California, Los Angeles.

<HEAD>LaRouche Convicted of Tax and Mail Fraud Conspiracy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf bgng, `All seven,' to NOTE that all defendants
remain free on their own recognizance</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury Friday convicted political
maverick Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. of 13 counts of tax and mail fraud
conspiracy for cheating federal tax collectors as well as his
supporters whose loans were never repaid.
   After less than two days of deliberations, the jury of eight
women and four men also convicted six LaRouche associates of mail
fraud and conspiracy in the case of $30 million in defaulted loans.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. set sentencing for
Jan. 27.
   Larouche, a perennial independent presidential candidate who
condemned the convictions as an ``obscene miscarriage of justice,''
faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling
$3.25 million.
   The other six face lesser penalties for their roles on the mail
fraud and conspiracy charges.
   The six are William Wertz, who was LaRouche's chief fund-raiser;
Edward Spannaus, his legal coordinator, and fund-raisers Michael
Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.
   LaRouche, 66, and the six aides were charged with mail fraud and
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $30 million in loans from
supporters without any intention of repaying them.
   All seven defendants were convicted of all 48 counts in the
indictment returned on Oct. 14 by a federal grand jury. They
remained free on their own recognizance until sentencing.
   LaRouche, who did not testify in his own defense, stood rigidly
facing the jury with his arms crossed in front of him as a clerk
recited the guilty verdict on all 13 counts against him. Afterward,
he sat down without a word or gesture. Ms. Rubinstein broke into
tears and fell into the arms of a friend after she left the
courtroom.
   Defense attorneys said they planned to appeal the convictions.
   LaRouche told a news conference later that his conviction was ``a
wrong, gross, disgusting, obscene miscarriage of justice'' which he
said was the result of a long ``campaign of hate'' by the news media
and friends of the Soviet Union within the federal government.
   ``The way the jury voted, I'm dead,'' he said, adding that he
fully expects to be killed in prison if his conviction is upheld in
appeals courts.
   But LaRouche said he would leave behind an international
``anti-Bolshevik resistance'' that his followers were willing to
fight and die for.
   Under questioning by reporters, LaRouche said repeatedly that he
felt no remorse for what happened to those who loaned money to his
organization, many of them elderly people who have never gotten
their money back.
   ``They were wronged, not by us but by the government,'' he said.
Larouche said it was the government that forced several of his
groups into involuntary bankruptcy and thus prevented his
organization from repaying the loans.
   Government prosecutor John Markham said he did not regard the
verdict as a victory.
   ``I consider this an obvious conclusion to a long pattern of
false statements to trusting senior citizens,'' he said. ``Their
dreams for their retirement are gone. It's a sad case.''
   In addition to the charges connected with the loans, LaRouche was
accused of conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service by
having all his personal expenses paid by various corporations he
controls, and claiming he had no taxable income.
   Government prosecutors said LaRouche has not filed federal income
tax returns for any year since 1978 and that he conspired to conceal
the expenses that were paid on his behalf.
   A separate criminal case involving LaRouche and 18 of his
followers is rescheduled for retrial in U.S. District Court in
Boston starting Feb. 27.
   In that case, LaRouche is charged with conspiring to obstruct
justice in connection with allegedly unauthorized use of credit
cards to raise $1 million for his 1984 presidential campaign.
   During 15 days of testimony in federal court in Alexandria, a
parade of prosecution witnesses testified that they had loaned
hundreds of thousands of dollars to the LaRouche organization but
got little if any of their money back.
   One lender was Elizabeth Sexton of Suffield, Conn., who said she
was never repaid the $112,800 she loaned to a LaRouche organization
to help finance an anti-drug book. Ms. Sexton said that when ``the
barrel ran dry'' in her personal funds, a persistent LaRouche
fund-raiser persuaded her to try to obtain a bank loan so she could
lend more money.
   Some of the most damaging testimony from a government witness was
given by Charles Tate, who told jurors that Wertz told his
fund-raising staff that ``there was no such thing as a loan.''
   Tate, a former security aide who quit the LaRouche staff in 1984,
quoted Wertz as ordering his staff to try to have the loans
converted to contributions and, if that were unsuccessful, not repay
them unless there was a ``political downside'' or a threatened
lawsuit.
   Christian Curtis, a former LaRouche fund-raiser, said his
superiors told him: ``If you're talking to a little old lady who
says she's going to lose her house, get the money. If you're talking
to an unemployed worker, get the money. These people are immoral,
anyway.''
   Curtis said LaRouche staffers called ``pigs or swine'' those
supporters who complained that their loans were not being repaid as
promised.
   Ms. Sexton said her fund-raising contact assured her that her
money was safer with the LaRouche organization than with her bank
because ``the banks are our enemies.''
   But Wayne Hintz, a former LaRouche finance officer, and LaRouche
aide Franklin Harrison Bell both disputed government contentions
that there was a policy not to repay the loans.
   Defense lawyers told the jurors there was no intent to defraud
the lenders. They argued that repayment became impossible when
LaRouche and his associates were forced to divert funds toward
resisting attacks by the news media and countering what they termed
government harassment.
   LaRouche's lawyers and two of their witnesses, a tax lawyer and
an accountant, contended that LaRouche had received goods and
services from his various organizations as ``non-taxable
compensation'' because LaRouche was an employee of those groups.
They said LaRouche did not have to file tax returns because he never
earned the minimum amount _ currently $1,100 _ of taxable income.

   A team of 17 volunteers ran into
complications obtaining an airplane Friday to take them to Soviet
Armenia, where they had planned to provide plastic tents for about
3,000 earthquake victims.
   ``This is frustrating,'' said Anthony Seraphin, president of a
Springfield-based company that came up with the idea for
quick-to-build, durable plastic shelters. ``There's 17 of us here
waiting to go and we've just heard a news report about people
literally freezing to death'' at the earthquake site.
   The Air National Guard had agreed to provide a C-141 transport
plane, but needed the approval of Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
before the civilians could board, Seraphin said.
   A Defense Department spokeswoman, Maj. Shelley Rogers, said
Friday night that the department received the request and ``it will
be forwarded to the State Department Monday.''
   ``It's got to get the proper approval,'' she said.
   She did not say how long the approval process could take.
   Soviet officials say the Dec. 7 quake claimed 55,000 lives and
left 500,000 of the 700,000 people in the area homeless.
   ``It's just so insane,'' Seraphin said. ``We're here ready to go
and we can't get through.''
   Seraphin said the group, whose mission was being coordinated with
the Armenian Relief Society, had hoped to leave by Saturday.
   Union Carbide Corp. of Danbury, Conn., which makes the resin from
which the film is manufactured, will pay the estimated $100,000 cost
of the effort.
   The team wants to take material for 100 opaque blue,
576-square-foot tents that will provide shelter for 30 people each,
said Union Carbide spokesman John P. Yimoyines.
   The tents will be warmed by the sun during the day, but will lose
much of their heat at night.
   ``They'll be good wind protection and weather protection,'' said
Lou Agnello, another Union Carbide spokesman. He said the film could
withstand temperatures as low as 50 degrees below zero without
cracking.
   Seraphin said the group is also looking elsewhere for a plane.

<TEXT>
   Hopes for a healthy world by the turn of the
century are threatened by discrimination against women and
alienation of youth from their parents, the head of the World Health
Organization said Friday.
   ``If you fail to give education to women, how can you give the
message of AIDS prevention ... of spacing childbirths'' and of
elementary sanitation and simple treatment of such child-killers as
diarrhea, asked Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima.
   The new WHO director-general departed from a prepared speech to
declare ``the gap between men and women'' an obstacle to achieving
WHO's goal of ``Health for all by the Year 2000.''
   In the fight against AIDS, ``since there is yet neither vaccine,
treatment nor cure, our only weapon against this lethal disease is
health education and information,'' he said in an address to the
National Council for International Health and the Council of
Washington Representatives on the United Nations.
   ``Yet if you look at reality, in many developing nations ... the
gap between men and women still depends on the economic climate. In
many developing countries ... only the men are going to school,'' he
said.
   Nakajima said WHO is leading not only a worldwide scientific
search for a vaccine against AIDS but also, with two other U.N.
agencies, is attacking the problem of providing basic knowledge to
women and mothers unable to read.
   The other agencies are the U.N. Children's Fund and UNESCO, the
U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
   Nakajima, a Japanese physician elected earlier this year as WHO's
fourth director-general, said there is an urgent need for parents
``to re-establish dialogue with our children.'' Answering a
question, he said young people especially in advanced countries seem
``completely isolated'' from their elders, experimenting with
narcotics and unsafe sex to the detriment of health.
   ``If we continue this kind of mistrust between generations, there
will be further deterioration'' of health, especially in the spread
of AIDS, he said.
   AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system and renders it
powerless against other illnesses.
   Nakajima said the long battle to eradicate tuberculosis was a
near-success until recently, when ``in just a few months the
situation changed in Africa, most probably due to the spread of AIDS
infection which decreased immunity _ and even some parts of the
United States like in New York City reported increased
tuberculosis...''
   He praised President Reagan's message to the recent world
conference on AIDS as a ``very powerful'' contribution to the fight
against ``the most serious disease of this century.'' Reagan upheld
the individual human rights of those infected while declaring them
responsible to ensure that the virus is not transmitted to others,
Nakajima noted.
   Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop has provided strong support
to WHO in its campaigns against both AIDS and smoking, Nakajima
said, asserting that tobacco causes 2.5 million premature deaths a
year, and 90 percent of lung cancer cases.
   He voiced hope that the United States will quickly pay $7.5
million in overdue U.N. assessments earmarked for the health
organization now that WHO has undertaken financial and personnel
reforms demanded by Congress.

   A gay rights leader warned Friday that outraged
voters will remember a judge's statement that he gave a lighter
sentence to a murderer partly because his two victims were
homosexuals.
   ``These two guys that got killed wouldn't have been killed if
they hadn't been cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,''
State District Judge Jack Hampton told the Dallas Times Herald in
Friday's editions.
   ``I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up
teen-age boys,'' he said Thursday. ``I've got a teen-age boy.''
   Hampton, 56, who hs been on the bench eight years, said the
homosexualty of the murder victims entered into his decision on Nov.
28 to give the 18-year-old killer a 30-year prison term instead of a
maximum life sentence.
   The judge said he would have given a harsher sentence to Richard
Lee Bednarski if his victims had been, for example, ``a couple of
housewives out shopping, not hurting anybody.''
   Hampton expressed no reservations about his statements, the
newspaper reported.
   ``Just spell my name right,'' Hampton said. ``If it makes anybody
mad, they'll forget it by 1990 (election year).''
   Hampton did not return a telephone call from The Associated Press.
   William Waybourn, president of the Dallas Gay Alliance, said the
organization's eight telephone lines began ringing constantly after
the newspaper published the judge's statements.
   He said he hopes Hampton's remarks will prompt the public to work
to remove him from the bench when he comes up for re-election.
   ``Judge Hampton said it himself: No one will remember this in
1990. But we will remember,'' Waybourn said.
   ``Being at the wrong place at the wrong time is just a tragedy,''
Waybourn said of the killings. ``I'm sorry for the families of the
men who were killed. They don't deserve this. And Hampton doesn't
deserve to be a judge.''
   Robert Flowers, executive director of the state Commission on
Judicial Conduct, declined to comment on Hampton's statements and
said the 11-member commission would investigate if a complaint were
filed.
   ``A judge's discretion is his or her own,'' Flowers said. ``And
generally, we haven't had too many occasions where the judge has
spoken about what his thought process has been (in sentencing).''
   Flowers also said the commission occasionally initiates an
investigation itself, but declined to say whether that would happen
in Hampton's case.
   The Texas Human Rights Foundation filed a complaint against
Hampton with the judicial conduct commission.
   ``The statements by Judge Hampton constitute judicial
misconduct,'' said Tom Doyal, legal director for the non-profit
group active in gay and lesbian issues.
   Doyal said Hampton's remarks ``show open disregard for the laws
of our state. He has created an entirely new class of crime: Murder
of expendable classes of people.''
   Hampton said he rejected a prosecution request for a life
sentence for Bednarski because he believed the murder victims were
not completely blameless.
   ``These homosexuals, by running around on weekends picking up
teen-age boys, they're asking for trouble,'' he said. ``They really
are.''
   A Richland College student at the time of his conviction,
Bednarski was convicted in the shooting deaths of Tommy Lee Trimble,
34, and Lloyd Griffin, 27.
   Testimony revealed that Bednarski and a group of nine friends
drove to the Oak Lawn area of Dallas to harass gay men the night of
May 15.
   The boys testified they were standing on a street corner jeering
at passers-by when Bednarski persuaded another boy to join him in
beating and robbing Trimble and Griffin, who had invited the boys
into their car.
   The four drove to a park and walked to a hilltop clearing,
according to testimony.
   Testimony did not reveal whether the victims actually solicited
sex from Bednarski and his friend. But, the judge said, ``I think it
was understood by everybody that they went into the bushes for some
oral sex.''
   The other youth testified that Bednarski immediately pulled a
pistol and ordered the men to take off their clothes.
   When they refused, Bednarski drew a pistol and started shooting.
Trimble died immediately, Griffin died three days later.

<HEAD>Costa Rica Protests Incidents on Border With Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government protested Friday to
Panama about violations of Costa Rica's southern border, saying such
incidents encourage suspicion among the two peoples.
   Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto issued the protest in a
letter to Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter which was
delivered to Panamanian Ambassador Dario Arosemena Gonzalez.
   The letter referred to border intrusions that reportedly occurred
last week but said such incidents have been happening regularly
since November 1987. Costa Rica shares all its southern border with
Panama.
   ``A situation has developed along the border that in no way
should continue,'' Madrigal said in his letter.
   The Costa Rican government is concerned ``not only because the
acts violate the territorial integrity of Costa Rica,'' but also
because they foment insecurity and suspicion between the people of
both nations, the letter said.
   It said the Panamanian National Guard, aided by soldiers and
intelligence officials, held eight Costa Rican citizens for five
hours last week after contraband coffee was found in a Panamanian
vehicle in Costa Rica.
   It also said Costa Rican Planning Minister Jorge Monge, touring
the border area Oct. 11, surprised a Panamanian military patrol of
eight men in two vehicles.
   When Monge asked if the soldiers knew they were in Costa Rica,
they explained they knowingly drove in Costa Rica territory as a way
to avoid poorly-maintained Panamanian border roads.
   Hernan Garron, the Costa Rican minister of public security, has
said border residents repeatedly complain about Panama violating
Costa Rican sovereignty.

<HEAD>Steinberg Defense Abandons Formal Insanity Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for a man accused of beating his
6-year-old adopted daughter to death said Friday they have decided
not to file a formal insanity plea to avoid taking action ``that
would poison the jury's mind.''
   Defense attorney Ira London said such a defense would require him
to call psychiatric experts to prove that Joel Steinberg was insane.
It would also require that prosecution psychiatrists be allowed to
examine Steinberg.
   ``We felt in view of the vast amount of investigation the DA has
done in this case, in view of all the reports they have obtained _
whether verified or unverified _ it would poison the jury's mind as
to Joel,'' London said.
   ``It would open the door to (questioning about) any rumor,
anything they had about Joel coming into this case,'' he said, ``so
we made a determination we didn't want that.''
   London was referring in part to reports of Steinberg's heavy drug
use, his often bizarre behavior, his reported belief in cults that
hypnotized people and used them sexually and his alleged violence
against others.
   London said he had not decided whether to continue pursuit of an
insanity defense in which he lets the jury infer from testimony _
without defense attorneys saying explicitly _ that Steinberg was
crazy the night Lisa was fatally injured.
   Steinberg, 47, is a disbarred lawyer charged with second-degree
murder in the fatal beating of Lisa, a child he illegally adopted
shortly after her birth.
   The first-grader was removed unconscious from the Greenwich
Village apartment Steinberg shared with his longtime companion,
Hedda Nussbaum, 13 months ago. The child died in the hospital three
days later.
   Lisa's death in an affluent, well-educated household shocked many
New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of
neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report
evidence of child abuse.
   Steinberg denies that he hit the girl, but Ms. Nussbaum, the
prosecution's chief witness, said he told her the night Lisa was
fatally injured that he had ``knocked Lisa down and she didn't want
to get up.''
   The defense team's decision to abandon the formal insanity
defense was announced just after state Supreme Court Justice Harold
Rothwax excused the jury for the day without any trial proceedings
because an alternate juror was ill.
   London's co-counsel, Adrian DiLuzio, said the defense does not
have to call witnesses to testify about Steinberg's state of mind.
   ``The evidence (of mental disease or defect) can emerge from any
source,'' DiLuzio said. ``If the evidence emerged from the
prosecution's witness _ as I would submit to you it may have _ then
that may be considered by the jury as meeting our burden of going
forward on the affirmative defense.''
   An example of what DiLuzio was talking about is found in London's
five-day cross-examination of Ms. Nussbaum, in which she testified
that Steinberg said and did bizarre things before Lisa's death.
   But if London and DiLuzio try for an insanity defense without
saying so, prosecutors on summation will almost certainly call the
jury's attention to it and argue that no psychiatric experts have
been presented to support it.
   And Rothwax indicated he would instruct the jurors that an
insanity defense was being offered _ whether the defense called it
that or not _ and he would say it was up to them to decide whether
Steinberg was criminally responsible for Lisa's death.
   The trial was to resume Monday.

   A student shot two teachers, killing
one and seriously wounding another, then began firing on a classroom
full of students Friday, police said.
   The student's gun jammed before anyone was hit and he was
disarmed by the students and teachers in the classroom at the
Atlantic Shores Christian School, said police spokesman Lewis
Thurston.
   The two teachers were shot about 10:30 a.m. in separate
classrooms in which there were no students, Thurston said. The
student, a sophomore at the school, then allegedly entered the third
classroom and opened fire with a Mac-10 9mm pistol, similar to a
small Uzi, before the weapon was wrestled away, Thurston said.
   He identified the teacher who was killed as Karen Farley, in her
late 30s or early 40s. Teacher Sam Marino, 37, was in serious
condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, said Anne Adler,
spokeswoman at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.
   The shootings occurred in the junior and senior sections of the
school, in a complex of four trailers outside the main building.
   School officials did not know the two teachers had been shot
until they realized they had not seen one of them since the
shooting, and her body was not found until about 90 minutes after
the incident, Thurston said.
   The suspect, whom police declined to identify because he is a
juvenile, was charged with one count of first-degree murder, one
count of malicious assault and four counts of attempted murder. He
also was charged with using a firearm in a felony and discharging a
firearm in an occupied building.
   Thurston said the youth is either 15 or 16 and a sophomore at the
school.
   He said police have no motive for the shooting. Police found
homemade explosives in a locker in the school, but he had no further
information on where they came from, Thurston said.
   David Terry, a city deputy sheriff who was at the scene, said he
had been told that a third teacher was the gunman's intended target.
   The school, which is affiliated with the fundamentalist Atlantic
Shores Baptist Church, has 500 students in kindergarten through 12th
grade. Students were sent home following the shooting and school
trustee Martin Boelens said students were receiving counseling.
   Church officials would not allow reporters in the school and a
parent said she had been advised not to speak to reporters.

   The Roman Catholic cardinal of Cebu
and two other priests were attacked and beaten Saturday by a man as
they were giving communion at an early morning Mass, police said.
   Police and witnesses said the man, Eduardo Espinosa, struck
Cardinal Ricardo Vidal, 57, with his fist in the back of the neck,
sending him sprawling to the floor.
   Two other priests, Rev. Achilles Dakay and Rev. Hermingildo
Montecillo, rushed to the cardinal's aid and were also beaten,
police said.
   The incident occurred during early morning services at a church
in Talisay, 7 miles south of Cebu City.
   Vidal was rushed to a hospital and was reported resting. The
assailant was arrested. Patrolman Hannibal Larida said the man told
police he was ``out of my mind'' when he attacked the cardinal.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Says France To Withdraw Some Troops From Chad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French President Francois Mitterrand
said Friday that his country plans to withdraw some of its soldiers
from Chad now that Libyan troops have been driven out of the central
African country.
   Speaking at a news conference at the close of the 39-nation
Franco-African summit, Mitterrand did not specify how many of the
1,700 troops in Operation Sparrowhawk will leave Chad, or when.
   ``Now that peace is approaching and Chad has achieved its unity
and reestablished its sovereignty, the military need is not the
same,'' Mitterrand said.
   Presidential aides said Mitterrand discussed the issue privately
with President Hissene Habre of Chad and agreed on terms for the
pullout.
   Under Operation Sparrowhawk, which began in February 1986 at
Habre's request, the French guaranteed the security of roughly half
of Chad's territory _ the portion south of the 16th parallel.
   Chadian troops drove the Libyans out of northern Chad in a series
of attacks between December 1986 and August 1987. France said its
troops were not directly involved, although both France and the
United States supplied military aid to the Chadians.
   French troops were sent to Chad in 1983, then withdrawn in 1984
as part of an agreement with Col. Moammar Gadhafi for a simultaneous
departure of Libyan troops. The Libyans, however, did not live up to
their part of the bargain.
   Of the 39 countries at the 15th Franco-African summit, 22 were
represented by their armed forces chiefs of staff.
   In a statement issued at the conclusion, the countries said they
were pleased at the prospects of settlements in Angola and the
Western Sahara, but expressed concern at falling commodities prices
which ``paralyze all development in Africa and make the debt burden
unbearable.''

   Federal prosecutors will not seek any more
indictments against the targets of a 16-month grand jury
investigation into Jim Bakker's leadership of the PTL ministries.
   ``We do not expect to ask the grand jury to return any additional
indictments against anyone,'' said James Knapp, a deputy assistant
attorney general who oversees the Justice Department's criminal tax
investigations.
   The grand jury indicted Bakker and three former associates on
Dec. 5, charging that they misused millions of dollars of PTL money.
   Bakker and Richard Dortch, Bakker's former top deputy, are
charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. David Taggart,
Bakker's former personal secretary, and James Taggart, PTL's former
interior decorator, are charged with tax evasion and conspiracy.
   Prosecutors and Justice Department officials considered seeking
tax charges against Bakker and Dortch. But Assistant U.S. Attorney
Jerry Miller said Thursday Bakker and Dortch would not be charged
with any more crimes.
   Bakker, Dortch, the Taggart brothers and Roe Messner, PTL's chief
builder under Bakker, had been identified as targets of the
investigation.
   Messner was not named in the indictment.
   Bakker, 48, resigned in 1987 amid revelations he had a sexual
encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn and paid her
hush money. Three months later, amid reports of financial
wrongdoing, PTL filed for bankruptcy.
   On Tuesday, Canadian real estate magnate Stephen Mernick, an
Orthodox Jew, bought PTL's assets, including its Christian theme
park, hotel and broadcast studios in Fort Mill, S.C., for $65
million in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   The fate of the PTL's religious operations, which were spun off
by the court into the non-profit Heritage Ministries, remained
unclear. Heritage Ministries uses facilities at the theme park.

<TEXT>
   Civil rights attorney Wiley Austin Branton,
counselor to nine black students who were instrumental in the
desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957,
has died of a heart attack. He was 65.
   Branton died Thursday at his home in Washington, said his son,
Wiley Branton Jr.
   A native of Pine Bluff, Ark., Branton was among the first black
graduates of the University of Arkansas School of Law. He was chief
local counsel for the nine blacks who entered Central High School,
the first time federal troops were used to enforce desegregation
orders.
   Branton became the first director of the Atlanta-based Voter
Education Project in 1962 at the request of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. The project signed up blacks to vote across the South.
   In 1965, he became a special assistant to Attorney General
Nicholas B. de Katzenbach, a post he retained under Katzenbach's
successor, Ramsey Clark. He became executive director of the United
Planning Organization, Washington's antipoverty agency, two years
later.
   Branton was named the eighth dean of Howard University Law School
in 1977. He returned to private practice in 1983, becoming a partner
in the Washington office of Sidley and Austin, a Chicago-based firm.
   Branton at one time was convicted of a misdemeanor for teaching
the mechanics of voting to blacks. In the 1960s, he represented
freedom riders in Mississippi and blacks involved in voter
registration drives. At the time of his death, Branton was a member
of the board of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
   Funeral services are scheduled Monday at the National Cathedral
in Washington, with a graveside service and burial in Pine Bluff on
Wednesday.

   A prominent Ohio poet and two members of his family were killed
Friday when fire broke out in their home, and four children and an
adult died in an Alabama blaze believed started by matches.
   In New York City, about 200 people were left homeless when a fire
raged through a Staten Island apartment complex, but there were no
serious injuries, firefighters said.
   In Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, poet James Kilgore,
58, his daughter Sheila, 24, and her 19-month-old son, Julius, died
in the fire, authorities said. Kilgore's wife, Alberta, and son,
Steven, were treated for smoke inhalation.
   Kilgore was the author of nine volumes of poetry and a teacher
for 22 years at Cuyahoga Community College, said college spokeswoman
Marcia Ballinger. He won the Ohio Poetry Association's Ohio Poet of
the Year award in 1982 with his last volume of poetry, ``African
Violet: Poem for a Black Woman.''
   Beachwood Fire Chief William Kaselak said the fire was under
investigation.
   In York, Ala., the blaze that killed five early Friday apparently
began when youngsters in the home played with matches. Survivors had
to go two blocks to find a phone to call firefighters.
   Sumter County Coroner James Campbell said firefighters had no
chance of saving anyone in the wood-frame house, which was reported
ablaze about midnight.
   ``It was burned about 75 percent when we got there, and it was
about 90 percent by the time they got it extinguished,'' he said.
   Two families shared the home, said Fire Chief Wayne Simmers. He
identified the dead as brothers Harold Wayne and Michael Evans, both
3, their 9-year-old sister, Shameka, the childrens' uncle, Nathaniel
Evans, 21, and his 3-year-old son, Tony Chapman.
   Campbell said three other children escaped and told investigators
they had been playing with matches.
   The nearest occupied house was about a half-block away, the
coroner said, but the children had to go two blocks before finding a
home with a telephone to summon firefighters.
   Some 30 familes were left homeless by the five-alarm fire in the
Staten Island apartment complex. The blaze, apparently an accidental
electrical fire, began in a fourth-floor apartment late Thursday and
spread to the roof of the seven-story brick structure, causing the
roof to partially collapse, said Fire Department spokesman John
Mulligan.
   Mulligan said the blaze was well-advanced by time firefighters
arrived and was not under control until early Friday. ``We were
hampered by wind, cold and ice,'' he said.
   About 100 people were staying with relatives or friends and the
rest were put up in motels, said Mike Azzara, executive assistant to
Borough President Ralph Lamberti.

   A sharp earthquake rattled Southern California a day after snow
and sleet blanketed the fire-blackened region, while hurricane-force
winds pounded Northern California, cutting power to hundreds of
thousands and leading to two children's deaths.
   The winds, clocked at up to 102 mph, died down Thursday night,
shortly before the temblor hit 500 miles to the southeast in a state
suffering in recent weeks from a relentless attack of nature's worst
elements.
   The northerly winds fanned fires, uprooted trees and overturned

   Despite a plea by soul singer James Brown that
he'd do anything to avoid prison and continue performing, a judge
sentenced him to six years for failing to stop for police in a
two-state car chase.
   Circuit Judge Hubert Long sentenced Brown on Thursday after an
Aiken County jury convicted the 55-year-old ``Godfather of Soul'' of
one count of failing to stop for police and two counts of aggravated
assault in the Sept. 24 chase.
   The jury acquitted Brown of two counts of assault with intent to
kill.
   Long gave Brown a choice in sentencing him on the assault
convictions: pay a $6,000 fine and spend five years on probation or
do six months in prison. Brown won't have to decide until after he
serves the six-year term, said the prosecutor, Solicitor Robert
Harte.

acquaintance and persuaded to surrender after the gunman shot three
people and took a hostage.
   A psychiatric evaluation was ordered Thursday for Warren Murphy,
39, who was charged with assault with intent to commit murder during
the 13-hour ordeal at the main New Orleans post office.
   Murphy gave himself up late Thursday morning and released his
hostage, a 29-year-old postal worker described as his girlfriend,
said police spokeswoman Carmine Menchel. The hostage, Carol Smith,
was not harmed.
   Three people were shot during the ordeal but none was in serious
condition, hospital spokesmen said.

   The FBI must explain why it has kept a
classified file for six years on a high school senior who was
investigated after writing to the Soviet embassy for an encyclopedia
project, a judge says.
   ``Do all 11- or 12-year-olds have to be fearful they will have to
go through the same experience as Todd Patterson if they just write
to a foreign government?'' U.S. District Judge Alfred M. Wolin asked
Thursday.
   The agency has requested that Wolin dismiss a lawsuit brought by
the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Patterson, who as a
sixth-grader embarked on a social studies project that would teach
him far more than he bargained for about the real world.
   Six years ago, the youth wrote to foreign embassies asking for
information about their countries to compile his own encyclopedia.

<HEAD>Eternal City Losing War against Modern-Day Ravages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When an Italian historian recently called Rome a
corrupt, vulgar and violent city that shouldn't be the nation's
capital, Romans rose up in anger.
   But many also conceded that the Eternal City that has survived
sackings, sieges and the fall of an empire appears helpless against
the onslaughts of the 1980s _ not to mention what lies ahead in
1990, when Italy serves as host to the World Cup soccer tournament.
Rome has virtually no major projects under way to prepare for an
event comparable to the Olympics.
   Chaotic traffic, air and noise pollution, crumbling monuments and
inadequate public transportation are some of the symptoms of modern
Rome's problems.
   ``The central government has never really had any interest in
governing Rome,'' says Francesco D'Onofrio, a former Christian
Democrat senator who is one of many who favor moving government
offices out of the historic center.
   There is a proposal, though still far from being realized, to
build a government and business center on 1,600 acres on the eastern
edge of the city.
   ``Rome isn't really a capital, it's a work of art and works of
art ought not to be capitals,'' said the American author Gore Vidal,
who has kept an apartment in central Rome for 26 years.
   While Italy has experienced great economic strides in recent
years and claims to have surpassed Britain as the world's fifth
largest industrial power, the capital has continued to suffer from
what many here describe as second-rate services.
   Romans themselves have long complained about the deterioration of
their city, but it took a verbal broadside by a Parliament member
and historian from Turin to push the issue to the forefront of
national attention.
   Explaining why he spearheaded the defeat of a bill in
Parliament's Chamber of Deputies that would have allocated $156
million for restoration of Rome monuments, Luigi Firpo declared:
``Rome is rotten, asphyxiated by car fumes. It would be useless to
undertake major restorations. It would be better to choose another
capital for the country.''
   Rome's woes are probably best exemplified by its traffic
nightmare, an enemy that even Julius Caesar failed to defeat when he
tried to ban wagons and chariots from the city center in 45 B.C.
   Today, 1.8 million cars and 200,000 motorcycle and motorscooters
fight for space in ancient, narrow streets. With only one municipal
parking garage and no metered spaces to choose from, every day some
200,000 cars end up illegally parked, many on sidewalks.
   Despite the Italians' reputation for fast driving, cars in Rome
travel at an average speed of 6 mph, compared to 15 mph in most
other European capitals.
   The cacophony of roaring traffic, honking horns and screaming
sirens average 76.4 decibels, 11 above the level considered
unhealthy for humans.
   The gridlock never lets up since Rome actually has four rush
hours. In addition to the morning and evening crush, there is the
mad dash home for lunch and, following a siesta, the trip back to
the office.
   In the most drastic step taken so far, the city early this year
started banning private vehicles from entering the center from 7
a.m. to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Monday-through-Saturday.
   But the ban has only worsened the traffic on the outskirts and
barely dented the congestion downtown because thousands of special
permits are given to Parliament members, government officials,
journalists, doctors, judges and others.
   ``The Roman public eagerly wants the traffic problem to be
resolved ... but each of us rejects even the idea of leaving the car
in the garage for two or three days a week,'' columnist Miriam Mafai
wrote in La Repubblica, Italy's largest daily newspaper.
   Those who choose public transporation aren't muh better off.
Buses are so crowded that passengers shove and scream for a space to
breathe, while pickpockets have a field day.
   Rome's Metropolitana (subway) has only two lines and 15.5 miles
of track and transports only 400,000 passengers a day, one-fourth
the total of Paris' subway, the Metro. Officials say they can't dig
further because of all the archaelogical treasures lying beneath the
city.
   The lack of public transportation is one reason why 63 percent of
Romans drive to work each day. The resulting exhaust fumes make Rome
one of the most polluted cities in Europe, prompting some bicyclists
and traffic cops to don surgical masks and leading Italy's Greens
Party to propose that the entire city be put under curfew once smog
reaches a certain level.
   The smog also eats away at the city's ancient monuments, leaving
arches, columns and buildings concealed behind green cloth and
scaffolding for painstaking restorations that last years and deny
tourists a look at some of the symbols of imperial Rome.
   In the last quarter century, Rome has absorbed some 2 million
immigrants from other parts of Italy. But very few urban development
projects have been carried out since Rome hosted the 1960 Olympics.
   Plans for an archaelogical park extending from the Colosseum to
the Old Appian Way, a railroad ring around the city and an
underground tunnel have once again been put on hold.
   ``It will be a pity if Rome is unable to capitalize on this huge
opportunity,'' said Luca Di Montezemolo, head of the Italian
organizing committee. ``Two years ago I thought Rome could have
benefited the way it did from the 1960 Olympics, but it looks too
late now.''
   As public services, including electrical and telephone, have
broken down so have the patience, tempers and manners of many
Romans. Just watch them pushing and cursing each other as they try
to beat the line at a bank or post office.
   Sociologists have noted a rise in violence and racial
intolerance, including an incident in which an African woman was
chased off a bus by passengers shouting, ``Leave the seats to the
whites.''
   For all its detractors, Rome still has its eternal supporters.
   Said novelist Alberto Moravia:
   ``Rome is what the Italians want it to be. All types of Italians
live and work in Rome. Rome is a cross-section of Italy.
   ``Rome has always gone to ruin, but at the same time it has
always been very much alive.''

<HEAD>A Mine Field for Rock Stars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock superstar Phil Collins wanted a supporting
role when he did his first movie, and he didn't want to sing in it
because he wanted to be taken seriously as an actor.
   Instead he's playing the title role in ``Buster,'' the story of
Buster Edwards, one of the men who pulled off Britain's ``great
train robbery'' in 1963. He also talked himself into singing two
songs: ``Two Hearts,'' which plays over the ``Buster'' credits, and
``Groovy Kind of Love,'' a hit single.
   ``I'd have been happy going in at the shallow end rather than the
deep end,'' he says. ``It's a mine field _ rock stars acting.''
Critics have praised Collins' performance though they were lukewarm
to the movie itself.
   Collins also didn't intend to put himself in danger in his movie
acting debut. However, for an early scene establishing Buster as a
small-time thief, Collins said he'd bash in a store window himself,
using a metal garbage can.
   ``A stuntman said the dustbin could bounce back and hit me in the
face. He told me to hold it up in front of my face and make sure no
huge splinters fell down and cut my head off.''
   Collins had beginner's luck. ``When I break the huge plate-glass
window, go in, get the dummy and come out, that was one take,'' he
says.
   Director David Green got the idea of casting Collins as Buster
after seeing the rocker in his first acting role, as the host of a
rigged game show on a ``Miami Vice'' episode.
   Collins described Buster as ``a bit different from most
villains.''
   ``A professional thief is what he was. He came out of prison and
went straight back inside for shoplifting. For 13 years he has been
on the straight. He's got a flower shop outside Waterloo Station.
He's become a bit of a tourist attraction.''
   Collins met Buster Edwards. ``We've become very good pals,'' he
says. ``In personality I don't think we're that far away. He's a
very friendly bloke; I think I am, too. Our backgrounds are
different and we come from different parts of London. Since I was 5
or 6 I just wanted to be involved with music; he obviously didn't
have that kind of dream. When kids were going around causing trouble
I was home practicing the drums.''
   Collins became a drummer in the hit British group Genesis. He
revived the group's career in 1976 by stepping forward as vocalist
and then he became a major rock soloist.
   The movie takes a certain amount of poetic license, Collins said.
Buster's wife, June (Julie Walters), returns to England from Mexico,
where they'd fled. Buster followed because of his love for her. In
reality, the rocker says, ``June didn't like Mexico and they went
back to England together. He walked into a police station and gave
himself up. In the early '60s if you're working class you never
traveled far. You didn't eat spicy food or have a suntan.''
   When shooting began, the director kept Collins away from the
rushes, fearing he'd see things he'd want to do over. Then Collins
happened to walk in while rushes were being shown one day.
   ``I saw a scene I didn't think I was very good in, where I come
home from the robbery and have a confrontation with June's mother.''
He liked it, which gave him confidence.
   Collins' sister, Carole, plays a nosy neighbor in the film. ``She
auditioned for the part and got it. She doesn't do it for a living,
just the odd thing. She has her own talent agency, for adults. She
was a professional ice skater for many years,'' he said.
   ``My mother is an agent for kids. My brother is a cartoonist. My
father had the normal job in the family. He was in insurance in the
City of London for 40 years.''
   Collins said he wouldn't do the music and put the production
company in touch with Lamont Dozier. But he wound up being involved
afterall.
   ``He came up with a couple of songs that needed words. I thought
I should write the words. Because I was so involved with the film
and the part, I felt I could summarize the feelings in the lyrics.''
   Collins got involved in helping choose other music in the film,
too, such as ``I Got You Babe'' by Sonny and Cher, and ``Sweets for
My Sweet'' by the Searchers, which was No. 1 the week of the robbery.
   ``A Groovy Kind of Love'' was an uptempo hit for the Mindbenders
in the '60s. ``I thought it would be nice to have a slow version in
the radio for background, somewhere. I did a little demo at home and
the director liked it so much he used it at the end, over the
arrest, when I get taken away,'' Collins said.
   ``We looked at a list of songs we could use in the film, 10
seconds of some of them,'' he said. ``They're all just on the radio;
they give an indication of the period.
   ``The only song that's loud is the Four Tops' `Goin' Loco Down in
Acapulco,' when they first get to Mexico. Lamont and I wrote it.''
   But lawyers wouldn't allow them to use any songs by the Beatles.
``I found that very frustrating. I rang all the surviving Beatles.
They said, `yes,' but the lawyers wouldn't let us. I couldn't work
out why.''
   Collins would like to do another film, playing a different type
of character. He has an idea for a remake of ``Goldilocks and the
Three Bears,'' starring himself and three other actors.

<HEAD>South Korea's Economic Development Claims Thousands of Lives</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breakneck efforts to expand the economy
is exacting an enormous human price in South Korea. Thousands of
workers are killed or crippled every year in what critics claim is
the world's highest industrial accident rate.
   The economic miracle has transformed South Korea in 30 years from
a poor, backward nation into an industrial powerhouse, but little
attention has been paid to the cost of the rapid growth.
   An average of five workers are killed and 390 are injured every
day in accidents in every kind of workplace, from huge factories and
shipyards to backstreet sweatshops employing two or three people.
   In 1987, 1,761 workers were killed in job accidents and 25,244
were maimed, according to government figures. In the three years
from 1985 to 1987, 5,139 workers were killed and 66,991 were maimed,
the figures show.
   The number of serious accidents is increasing as the economy
grows. The accident rate rose from 654 deaths and 2,717 crippling
accidents in 1972 to the 1987 total, the figures show.
   The Korean Federation of Labor Unions and academic experts, using
figures from international labor sources, contend South Korea has
the world's highest industrial accident rate. Safety standards are
not enforced and the government and businesses are concerned only
with economic growth, they claim.
   South Korea's accident rate is five times greater than
neighboring Japan's or Taiwan and about 15 times higher than Western
nations, officials said.
   Labor Ministry officials deny that South Korea has the world's
worst accident rate, but said they did not know of a nation with a
higher one.
   The International Labor Organization, an arm of the United
Nations in Geneva, said it does not compile comparative figures on
industrial accidents.
   Government officials acknowledge that little has been done to
enforce safety and health regulations and many people work in
dangerous conditions. The government wants to cut the accident rate
in half by 1990, they say.
   ``It's shameful to have such a high industrial accident rate,''
said Kim Jung-kyu, who heads the Ministry of Labor's safety section.
   Labor union activists maintain that the main causes of accidents
are poor working conditions and pressure on workers to meet
production schedules at any price.
   Many factories have little or no safety gear, and workers spend
up to 12 hours a day in deafening, poorly lit and overheated
workspaces where they become fatigued and easily make mistakes that
cause accidents, activists said.
   ``Many workers spend their days in terrible, dehumanizing
conditions where they are considered virtually expendable. There are
always more workers ready to work,'' said one activist.
   Past authoritarian governments played a major role in planning
and directing South Korea's rapid economic and industrial expansion.
The governments allowed businesses to ignore or scrimp on safety and
helped suppress labor protests.
   The Labor Ministry's safety section, which is responsible for
enforcing safety nationwide for more than 6 million industrial
workers, has a staff of 13 people.
   While insisting that the government attitude has changed, Kim
said safety still is ignored by many employers. Many companies save
money by not installing safety devices or training workers to use
equipment, he said.
   Park Sang-nak, a top safety official with the Korean Federation
of Labor Unions, said it is cheaper for companies to pay
compensation to injured workers than spend money on safety equipment.
   Employers pay marginal compensation for accident victims under
Korean law. Maximum compensation for the family of a worker killed
in an accident provides enough money to live on for just two or
three years, officials said.
   The growing sophistication of Korean industry is adding to safety
problems and accident rates, rather than cutting them as in other
nations, officials say.
   Many companies eager to get ahead often introduce advanced
equipment before their workers are capable of using it safely,
government and labor officials said.
   ``Companies have gotten big by using new tools, advanced
technology and dangerous chemicals,'' Park said. ``But workers have
not been given adequate education or training.''
   But Kim of the Labor Ministry said many workers are indifferent
to safety and he claimed that carelessness is one of the main causes
of accidents.
   ``Many workers do not wear helmets, goggles or heat-proof
clothing even when it is provided.''
   Labor unions and political parties are pressing the government to
take drastic action to enforce safety regulations and cut accidents.
Poor safety is the second main cause of strikes after wage demands.
   President Roh Tae-woo's administration, which took office in
February, says it wants to drastically reduce industrial accidents
as part of its efforts to improve life for the working classes.
   Roh hopes to attract more public support for his administration
and defuse potential worker unrest. The government no longer
automatically sides with management and has encouraged companies to
give raises and other concessions.
   The Labor Ministry plans a major survey of businesses to ensure
safety regulations are enforced and to cut accidents by more than
half by 1990.
   But a government plan to increase safety spending by 280 percent
in 1989 will still mean just $17.4 million is available _ far below
the levels of most industrial nations. Plans for more safety
inspectors will add just a few dozen personnel.
   Labor leaders call the plan inadequate.

<HEAD>A Reminder About Czechoslovakia in PBS Documentary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the midst of the enthusing over Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the remarkable reforms he has launched in
the Soviet Union, a PBS special Wednesday reminds that all is not
rosy on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
   The title of the documentary, ``Czechoslovakia: The Long Wait for
Spring,'' refers to the ``Prague spring'' of 1968, when reforms
introduced by Premier Alexander Dubcek raised hopes for new freedom
after 20 years of hard-line communism.
   A few months later, those hopes were crushed under the treads of
invading Soviet tanks. Today, little evidence remains in
Czechoslovakia of the ``Prague spring,'' which, ironically, Soviet
citizens seem to be enjoying under Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost.''
   The documentary crams a lot of historical, economic and
socio-political information into one hour, but also gives the
country a human face.
   Viewers are taken on a whirlwind tour of the country, from
Prague, just as modern and beautiful as many other European cities,
at least on the surface, to the grimy iron-smelting plants that seem
to have been lifted from another era.
   Indeed, the factories represent Czechoslovakia's biggest problem
_ economic dependence on the Soviet Union to support an outdated
heavy manufacturing industry. Czechoslovakia has little access to
other markets, except for its pilsner beer, Urquell, which is
exported to the West.
   In addition, Czechoslovakia is one of the most polluted countries
in Europe with its reliance on cheap brown coal for heating and
manufacturing.
   There are interviews with dissidents who hold little hope of soon
seeing the kind of reforms that Gorbachev has introduced in the
Soviet Union.
   ``You have to have a Gorbachev, and in Czechoslovakia so far no
one like that has appeared,'' says Zdenek Mlynar, a member of the
Dubcek government who was interviewed in Vienna where he lives in
exile. Forty years of hard-line communism and an economy hog-tied by
entrenched Stalinism will be hard to erase, he says. ``Now the word
is `go your own way,' but we have been crippled.''
   Other dissidents _ who took a chance just by being interviewed _
are part of a writers' group that was subjected to a government
crackdown after calling for recognition of human rights. One of
them, we are told, had been arrested five times before the interview
and again at least once since.
   Even more depressing than their own oppression is the dissidents'
despair over a spiritless new generation that has turned to drugs
and cares little for anything other than obtaining material
possessions.
   ``There is no aim of life, and everywhere you look you see the
result of this crisis,'' says Ivan Klima, an author who has been
published in the West. ``I think the young generation is rather
unpolitical and rather apathetic. They don't see any sense to fight
for any value.''
   The filmmakers also interview Communist Party members who seem to
live well under the system and enthusiastically support the
government. But the filmmakers are careful to stress that these
citizens were selected for interview by the authorities.
   Despite the problems lurking around the bend, Czechoslovakia
currently has the highest standard of living of any communist
country. ``The government's agreement with the people,'' says the
narration, ``is, we'll keep your stomachs full if you keep your
mouths shut.''
   Nevertheless, there are tiny signs of change. Czech filmmakers
are allowed to tackle such subjects as drug abuse, ``hooliganism''
and the black market in foreign currency. And the lack of
spirituality in the society has sparked a new interest in religion,
especially among young people.
   The film, a production of WTTW in Chicago, was produced by George
Vicas, a veteran television journalist who started out with the
``CBS Reports'' unit headed by Edward R. Murrow. He went on to work
for NBC and produce other documentaries for PBS, as well as the
National Geographic series.
   The principal writer of the film is journalist Sanford Ungar,
dean of the school of communications at American University in
Washington, D.C., whose father was born in Czechoslovakia.
   The documentary is a pilot for a possible new series on Eastern
bloc countries.

<BYLINE>Response Negative Since Baltimore Mayor Launched Drug Legalization
Debate</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By DEB RIECHMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke, who
launched a national debate on legalizing drugs earlier this year,
jokes that he's often introduced lately as a man who once had a
bright future.
   Schmoke, a former federal and state prosecutor, acknowledges his
views on decriminalizing drugs are not popular among politicians and
says he would have dodged the issue if someone had raised it during
his race for the mayor's office in 1987.
   And yet he doubts America can prosecute its way out of the drug
problem and insists something more must be tried.
   Schmoke, 38, was Baltimore state's attorney about three years ago
when an undercover officer, wired with a bugging device, was gunned
down.
   ``I listened to him die,'' Schmoke said in an interview before
speaking in Westminster, about 40 miles north of Baltimore. ``One of
the drug dealers shot him just because this officer was in the way
of a major profit-making operation.
   ``I've prosecuted thousands of drug offenders. I'm not soft on
crime. But as a mayor and citizen, I feel I have an obligation to
call for an alternative to the bloodletting in the streets and to
the shameful seduction of our children into the role of drug
pushers.''
   Thousands of calls and letters poured into Schmoke's office after
he went public with his belief that the war on drugs should be led
by the ``surgeon general, not the attorney general.''
   ``Early on I had a lot of mail very strongly negative to the
whole idea,'' Schmoke said. ``The way my mail is running now, people
generally feel that I'm wrong in my conclusion, but that I was right
to raise the issue and that the debate is healthy.''
   Schmoke, a Harvard-educated Rhodes Scholar and first black
elected mayor of Baltimore, grabbed national attention in April when
he addressed the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington.
   ``I was asked to give a speech about urban crime problems. I had
the speech written and then over the weekend, I decided `I'm
changing the speech,''' Schmoke said. ``I didn't tell anyone on my
staff. I just rewrote it, called a person in to type it and gave it
to my staff on my way into the meeting.''
   In revising it, he added the suggestion: ``Let's at least have a
national debate about decriminalizing drugs.''
   He explained, ``I thought that either I would be dismissed as a
kook, or the issue would catch hold and cause a major debate.''
   Five months later, he testified before the House Select Committee
on Narcotics, where his ideas got a chilly reception from some
politicians.
   For nearly two hours, Schmoke told committee members that
expecting the criminal justice system to solve the drug problem was
unrealistic.
   He suggested eliminating criminal penalties for possession of
marijuana, providing addicts with methadone maintenance and
increasing emphasis on treatment, prevention and education. Schmoke
also called for a high-level commission to study the potential
impact of decriminalization.
   ``The biggest misconception is that people think I favor people
using drugs, which is not true at all,'' Schmoke said. ``Alcohol is
legal, but we don't favor kids drinking scotch.
   ``What I am saying is that the drug issue is twofold. It's the
problem of abuse and the problem of crime associated with drug
trafficking. The criminal justice system might be good dealing with
one, but it's sure not good dealing with the abuse problem.
   ``If addicts had access to drugs through the public health system
and not through criminals, they would not have to steal and break
into houses and shoot people in order to get to the substance.''
   Schmoke says he's encouraged that his comments have prompted a
debate.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the narcotics
committee, is emphatically against any form of legalization.
   ``He says, `It's a dangerous idea. I feel that we must not
surrender in the war on drugs before we've even fought it,''' said
Robert Weiner, spokesman for Rangel. ``He asks `What do we do about
all the international treaties we signed to stop the flow of drugs?
He asks what kind of message legalization would send to young
people, and wouldn't it counter our anti-drug education programs?' ''
   Some athletes who had been taking anti-drug messages to Baltimore
area schools resigned from the education program after Schmoke
testified in Washington, Weiner noted. ``They said `Why should we do
that if the mayor is talking about legalizing drugs for addicts?'''
   However, Rep. James H. Scheuer, D-N.Y., another committee member,
praised Schmoke's testimony, and said he too believes it's time to
set up a bipartisan commission.
   ``Such a commission could avoid some of the political posturing
about drug issues that emerges as sure as the sun rises in the East
during every election year,'' said Scheuer, who believes America is
spending too much money on interdiction and enforcement and not
enough on treatment, education and prevention.
   Minneapolis Police Chief Tony Bouza agrees with Schmoke's call
for developing a national stategy to attack the drug problem.
   ``In 1966, President Johnson created the president's commission
on crime, which in 1967 gave us a blueprint for the future, gave us
a national strategy. We now need to replicate that effort,'' Bouza
said.
   ``Schmoke has really helped a lot by basically calling for `Stop
the music and let's bring a little thought to the process.'''

<HEAD>Commercial Real Estate; Boom and Bust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few things reflect investment fads and the
get-rich-quick mentality better than the commercial real estate
market.
   There is something about this market that seems ripe for
exploitation. And, since so many investors spy the opportunities
simultaneously they tend to knock each other off. Boom becomes bust.
   Some of the biggest institutions in America have played the game
and lost.
   Within the past 15 years, for instance, large commercial banks
tried to manage commercial properties and found the task required a
lot more talent than the mere understanding of an income statement.
   Much of the multibillion-dollar financial debacle of the nation's
savings and loan associations can be traced to a lust for real
estate profits and a departure from common sense. They guessed wrong
on their real estate ventures.
   Real estate partnerships sold millions of people on the idea of
cashing in on the big tax deductions of real estate. What a game;
the enterprise didn't even have to make a pretax profit. Tax
deductions would be the profit.
   Then Congress removed the tax deductions, suddenly causing the
real estate market to be one of many sellers and few buyers, a
situation that brings prices back to reality with a thud.
   Builders, themselves, are among the worst players of the game. So
true is this that it has become almost axiomatic that a sound way to
make money in real estate is to wait until the builder gets into
trouble and then lowball him.
   Decade after decade a very few investors with great foresight
ride the real estate cycle to the top and get off, leaving the vast
majority of investors to ride it back down. Hot markets cool
quickly; big losses replace big hopes.
   So much overbuilding has occurred during the past few years that
rents in some areas have actually fallen. In those areas, says
George Puskar, an authority, ``real estate has actually been
subsidizing corporate America.''
   Puskar, chairman of Equitable Real Estate Investment Management,
observes that rents are the second biggest expense for companies _
after payroll and benefits _ and rents have been flat or falling
because of the oversupply.
   Strangely, while commercial real estate attracts innovative,
daring and often highly successful entrepreneurs, as well as the
biggest institutional investors, it often has been run by the seat
of the pants.
   In the past, losses meant nothing to some of these entrepreneurs,
developers and promoters because they believed tax deductions,
inflation and divine intervention would bail them out.
   The tax deductions were eliminated, inflation calmed down in the
1980s and the divine interveners became occupied elsewhere. Only
then did some investors learn that real estate is a business.
   It isn't, after all, like stocks and bonds, which have liquid
markets. Hot real estate markets seem to be made up of all buyers,
but in a flash they become markets of all sellers. The Sun Belt
experience illustrates.
   Puskar states the newer, businesslike approach:
   ``You want to position investments in properties that will have
strong, steady cash flows over time and not be subject to boom-bust
cycles. You can't be successful looking to buy in on a surge and
sell quickly before a drop ...''
   Still, if the past remains a criterion, something new will be
introduced into markets in 1989 that will resurrect the same old
bullish enthusiams that lead to disaster.
   What will it be? Hard to say. However, there is growing concern
among important corporations owning first-class real estate that
they keep on the books at only a fraction of its market value.
   That's a dangerous practice these days because it might invite
raiders. The raiders might not want the company and its products
nearly so much as that undervalued real estate. They think they
might make a killing on that.
   It could be the start of something big.

   Its roots go back to 1492, when it became a
landfall for Christopher Columbus, but today the Dominican Republic
has economic problems so severe that it has boat people fleeing to
Puerto Rico and the United States. Its links with Columbus, however,
have given the government of the Caribbean-island nation new hope as
the 1992 Columbus discovery celebrations approach.

   This oldest capital in
the Western Hemisphere is filled with the roar of bulldozers and
clatter of jackhammers in preparation for the 500th anniversary of
Columbus' discovery of America.
   Hospitals, museums, libraries, schools, bridges and monuments are
springing up everywhere as part of a $500 million nationwide
public-works project President Joaquin Balaguer set in motion in
1987.
   It is the government's job-creating answer to an economic crisis
that has led to wage strikes, food riots and a flight of its people
in hazardous boat journeys across the Caribbean.
   Critics say the project geared to the Columbus celebrations is a
giant boondoggle that is fueling inflation while failing to tackle
the needs of the nation's 6.6 million people, half of whom are
involved in agriculture.
   They accuse the 81-year-old Balaguer, who is nearly blind with
glaucoma, of acting like an Egyptian pharaoh building pyramids.
   ``Balaguer is remodeling the city to the memory of Columbus,''
said Francisco Pena Gomes, a former Santo Domingo mayor and
political opponent of Balaguer. ``But these are unproductive works
because the agriculture sector has most of the work force, whereas
construction only employs 5 percent.''
   Much, though not all, of the construction is timed for the
anniversary in 1992 of Columbus' first voyage to the New World.
   Dating back to 1492 and the place where Columbus' remains are
said to be buried, Santo Domingo is hoping to attract thousands of
tourists for the 500th anniversary.
   The project's showcase is a 777-foot Columbus Lighthouse, with
beams forming a cross, rising above a rundown neighborhood near the
airport at a cost of $30 million. It is the butt of ridicule.
   `These days lighthouses aren't used by boats or planes,'' said
Juan Bosch, a former president and Balaguer opponent. ``So tell me,
what is the reason for this?''
   Government officials contend the works project has created
210,000 jobs and is underpinning an economy in transition from
reliance on the sugar industry, its mainstay for 400 years.
   ``I know my policy of construction has received a lot of
criticism,'' Balaguer said in an interview. ``But it has been
necessary to revitalize a stagnated economy and to produce jobs.''
   ``Everyone criticized the Versaille Palace, too,'' said chief
economic planner Guillermo Caram. ``And look at all the treaties
that were signed there. Who knows? Maybe in 1992, there will be an
armistice signed at the lighthouse between the world's debtors and
creditors.''
   By comparison with impoverished Haiti, with which it shares the
island of Hispaniola, the Dominican Republic is well-off and
politically stable.
   But economic growth nosedived in 1988 to 2.8 percent, from 8
percent in 1987, according to government figures. One of every three
workers is unemployed and inflation is officially pegged at 30
percent and estimated by private economists at twice that rate.
   The country's $3.5 billion foreign debt equals 68 percent of its
gross national product. The government has paid $780 million in
interest and servicing on the debt this year, but Balaguer says
relief will be sought with creditors because ``the national reality
is that we are not in a condition to pay.''
   From the daily ``apagones'' _ electrical blackouts that often
last hours _ to the proliferation of street hawkers, evidence of
economic distress abounds.
   At the U.S. Consulate, hundreds of Dominicans line up daily
hoping for a chance to go the United States, easily exhausting the
country's yearly quota of 20,000 immigrant visas. U.S. officials say
1 million Dominicans are in the United States _ more than half
illegally.
   Boat people cross the dangerous 90-mile Mona Passage separating
the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. They sell refrigerators,
ovens and televisions for the $500 to $3,000 passage in flimsy
``yola'' motor fishing boats.
   Puerto Rican authorities say some 3,000 Dominicans have been
arrested since April. Countless others make it across.
   The government has recently been hit by a wave of wage strikes
that many fear will fuel protests similar to ones in February and
March, when price hikes in gasoline, milk and rice caused street
clashes that left six people dead and dozens injured.
   In Santo Domingo, with 2 million inhabitants, an estimated
500,000 people are living in unsanitary, crowded shacks as they wait
for new housing projects because the government bulldozed their
homes to make way for a beltway.
   ``I've been waiting four months for a new home,'' said
61-year-old Juana Sofia Lubierez, whose family of 11 is sharing a
one-room house built by the government as temporary shelter after
her eight-room house was flattened.
   ``And look at us,'' she said. ``We're living like pigs. There's
no water, no lights, no bathroom.''
   Many blame the country's problems on the depressed sugar
industry, which has been battered by U.S. import quotas, low world
prices and increased competition from beet and corn sweeteners.
   From 1975 to 1981, the Dominican Republic exported an average
815,000 tons of sugar a year to the United States. The U.S. quota
for imports of Dominican sugar in 1988 was 176,710 tons. The cuts
forced up to 60,000 out of work in the last two years and reduced
foreign exchange earnings by $80 million.
   There are efforts to diversify the economy away from its heavy
dependence on sugar. But the only sector showing significant
improvement is tourism, which has provided $676 million in foreign
exchange this year. The country's nine duty-free zones accounted for
an additional $400 million in exports to the United States.
   To brake the falling value of the Dominican peso, the government
closed foreign-exchange centers and cracked down on a lucrative
black market when the peso fell from 33 U.S. cents to 12 in March,
1987. It has since stabilized and is valued at about 15 cents.
   Meanwhile, building for the future goes on.
   ``Balaguer's vision of the Dominican Republic is different from
others, and there's a lot of criticism that he thinks the country
will be another Egypt,'' said a foreign diplomat. ``But is he right
or is he wrong? The economy is suffering, but who knows if in the
long term he isn't right?''

   For nearly half this
century, two charismatic intellectuals with opposing ideologies have
dominated politics in the Dominican Republic.
   Joaquin Balaguer, the conservative incumbent president, and Juan
Bosch, his socialist foe, belong to an old breed of Latin American
leader _ a ``caudillo.''
   ``The caudillo is a social, political phenomenom of Latin
America, a product of our underdeveloped society,'' said Victor
Gomes Berges, a former foreign minister under Balaguer. ``Balaguer
and Bosch are the residues of this phenomenom.''
   Balaguer is 81 years old and nearly blind from glaucoma, but
otherwise in apparently good health.
   Bosch is 79 and equally robust. Both attribute their health to
hard work, strict diet and no alcohol. Neither shows signs of
slowing down.
   ``It may not be logical that a man who can't see can be
president, but I've done it,'' said Balaguer in an interview.
   Both Bosch and Balaguer are fiction writers, poets and
historians. Each has more than 20 books to his credit. Both are
savvy; both have mass appeal. But they approach politics from
opposing poles.
   Balaguer rose to power under the repressive dictatorship of Gen.
Rafael Trujillo, becoming his president. Trujillo was assassinated
in 1961, and Balaguer fled into exile a year later to New Orleans,
where he remained until 1965.
   He defeated Bosch in the presidential election in 1966 and has
been elected president three other times, most recently in 1986. His
four-year term expires in May 1990.
   Asked if he plans to run against Bosch, his declared opponent,
Balaguer said: ``At my age, I don't make definite plans.''
   But Dominicans expect a Balaguer-Bosch rematch.
   Educated in philosophy and law, Balaguer published this year a
witty, introspective book, ``Memories of a Courtesan in the Era of
Trujillo.''
   In it, he says he attempts to explain his role in the Trujillo
government, which despite brutal human-rights violation left
Balaguer's reputation largely untainted.
   ``Is there a valid morality for actions in political life and
another very different one for private life?'' Balaguer writes. ``I
don't know. But what is certain is that politics puts blinders on
men and converts them into docile instruments of causes which we
intimately reject.''
   Bosch went into exile in Europe during Trujillo's rule and
returned when Trujillo was assassinated. Two years later, in 1963,
he was elected president. It was the country's freest election in 38
years.
   But seven months into his term, Bosch's Marxist-inspired politics
resulted in a military coup. In 1965, a popular uprising called
Bosch back. Instead, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered an invasion
by U.S. military forces.
   ``Johnson had even come to my inauguration,'' Bosch said in a
recent interview. ``Afterwards, he said I was a communist and sent
in the Marines. If I was a communist, I'd be secretary of the
Communist Party.''
   A high school dropout, Bosch is a self-educated man whose
intellect has earned him literary recognition and the nickname
``Professor Bosch.''
   He leads the leftist Dominican Liberation Party, which he founded.
   Bosch says he's not a Marxist ``except in the sense I follow
Marx's economic theories; but politically, I am not a communist.''
   He said he believes Franklin D. Roosevelt was ``the last great
statesman, a social democrat.''

   Here are some facts and figures on the Dominican Republic:
   THE LAND _ The Dominican Republic makes up the eastern two-thirds
of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
Its area of 18,700 square miles is roughly size of Vermont and New
Hampshire combined. The terraian ranges from fertile plains to
mountains and deserts. Pico Duarte, at 10,206 feet, is the highest
mountain in Caribbean. The climate is sub-tropical with an average
temperature of 77 degrees. Its main agricultural products are sugar,
cocoa, coffee, tobacco and rice.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The island was discovered by Columbus in 1492 on his
first voyage to New World and was was ceded by Spain to France in
1697. Haiti held the entire island from 1822 until 1844, when the
independent Dominican Republic was established. The republic was
annexed to Spain from 1861 to 1865, when independence was restored.
Unrest brought an invasion by U.S. Marines in 1916 and a military
government was in place until 1924. Gen. Rafael L. Trujillo took
power in 1930 and established a repressive dictatorship that ended
with his assassination in 1961.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The population of about 6.6 million is
Spanish-speaking. Seventy-five percent are of mixed race, 15 percent
white and 10 percent black. Ninety-eight percent are Roman Catholic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GOVERNMENT _ Executive power is vested under the 1966
constitution in a president, elected by popular vote every four
years. Its bicameral Congress consists of a 27-member Senate,
representing 26 provinces and district of Santo Domingo, and a 92
member Chamber of Deputies. The nine-member Supreme Court is chosen
by the Senate.

   Prehistoric caves in France and Spain. Rome's
Coliseum or Athens' Acropolis. Egypt's mystic pyramids. It's hard to
imagine the Mediterranean world without its most famous landmarks.
   But the area's monuments face an uncertain future as they become
caught up in a push toward lucrative mass tourism that could
endanger them.
   Indicative of the dilemma facing the region's planners is the
view of Sayed Moussa, Egypt's head of tourism promotion, who
acknowledges that history and the tourist dollar can be at odds.
   ``Antiquities officials are so jealous of their rocks,'' he said.
``We have commercial interests to consider.''
   From another point of view, antiquities officials throughout the
area decry the uproar caused when saving monuments requires
difficult decisions affecting tourists.
   ``We in Egypt are constantly reminded that our monuments belong
not only to Egypt but to the world,'' said Mut'awie Balboush, head
of antiquities for Upper Egypt, where 23 restoration teams are
working to save failing structures.
   As a region, the Mediterranean Basin is the world's biggest
tourist attraction. Host to more than a third of all international
travelers, the region's 18 countries this year alone welcomed well
over 110 million visitors, 80 percent of them in Spain, Italy and
France. If experts are correct, 450 million to 700 million annual
visitors will head to the Med by 2025.
   Tourism is not new to the Mediterranean. Egypt and the rest of
the Middle East already were ancient when history buffs Alexander
the Great, Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte took time out from
conquest to go sightseeing.
   In most countries revenue from tourism is set aside at least
partly for saving antiquities.
   But transporting tourists pours exhaust fumes into the air.
Tourists stir up dust with their footsteps, touch fragile wall
paintings with sweaty hands or mar them with graffiti. Many ascend
shaky monuments like mountain goats for just the right photo.
   Even by breathing, tourists damage some monuments.
   Throughout the region, a staggering growth in tourism has
prompted self-defense decisions by antiquities officials.
   _In Spain, visited by 50 million tourists in 1988, officials a
decade ago closed the Altamira Caves with their 12,000-year-old wall
paintings of bison and horses. The images had been damaged seriously
by a sharp rise in humidity and temperature generated by 1,000
visitors a day. In 1982, the main cave was reopened but access
limited to no more than 30 tourists a day. A replica will be opened
to all comers in 1990.
   _In France, officials faced the same dilemma and closed the
Lescaux Caves near Montignac in 1963, a year after 100,000 visitors
surged into the cave network. A facsimile opened in 1983 draws
350,000 visitors annually, and officials have developed
tourist-control techniques for other caves in the Dordogne region,
trying to preserve paintings while allowing visits.
   _In Greece, tourism authorities say visitors have caused no major
damage but archaeologists counter that 30,000 feet trampling on the
Acropolis' floor each summer's day can be doing no good. In 1978,
the Parthenon, the fifth-century architectural glory of Athens'
Golden Age, was roped off to the public after years of being worn
and chipped away by visitors' heels.
   _In Italy, support scaffolding and a ban on traffic in Rome's
historic center have been tried to reduce monument deterioration
from acid rain, car exhausts and traffic vibrations. At least 10
percent of Italy's more than 50 million annual tourists go to Rome,
crowding such monuments as the Forum and Coliseum. Trevi Fountain
soon is going behind a clear plastic screen to accommodate tourists
during a year-long restoration. Restorer Giorgio Toracca said the
only way to stop deterioration of Rome's monuments would be to put
them under glass, ``but glass cages would change the entire view.''
   _In Egypt, a glass tunnel has been inserted into a 3,300-year-old
noble's tomb that tourists and time had damaged. The World Bank
financed the Swedish experiment as a possible solution to the
emergency facing many of the tombs of the West Bank cemetery of
pharaohs, queens, royal children and courtiers. The pilot project
has remained closed to tourists, however, as antiquities officials
debate its pros and cons, including whether the fragile tomb's
allure remains the same to people peering through glass.
   Of the Mediterranean countries, Egypt, said to house more than
half of the world's standing monuments, has suffered the most with
the crunch of time: burgeoning population, subterranean water,
pollution and salt attacking historic remains.

   Lanny Bell, director of Chicago House, a special arm of the
University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, has wrestled for 11
years with how to save decaying monuments in southern Egypt's Luxor
area, the greatest concentration of monuments on earth.
   Using photography and hand drawings, Chicago House is recording
some of Egypt's best-known monuments before they disappear.
   ``In many respects the modern Egyptians live in a huge outdoor
museum, and museums are to be visited,'' Bell said. ``The question
remains one of finding the best way to display an artifact, even an
artifact as large as a temple, to best advantage.''
   Most Egyptian monuments were built as places of worship with
restricted entry. Bell said the dilemma for antiquities officials is
keeping monuments in their natural settings while insulating them
against tourist hordes.
   ``Tourism is both necessary and desirable,'' he said. ``But if
the present rate of decay continues, as it has for 100 years, there
will be no need for tourists 200 years from now to visit Luxor for
its monuments.''
   Zahi Hawass, who controls Giza Plateau, Egypt's best-known
tourist area, is trying to make it safer both for tourists and its
monuments, the Giza pyramids and the Sphinx. He hopes television
monitors being installed inside the pyramids can stop tourist antics
that began 1,100 years ago when treasure hunters forced their way
into Cheops Pyramid.
   ``For the past 100 years this place has been a zoo, and for the
past 50 years antiquities authorities have had no plans to protect
the monuments from tourists,'' Hawass said. ``Our biggest problem in
Egypt is we have no concept that a monument should be a national
park, where people come to enjoy but behave.''
   Tourism has become Egypt's second largest earner of foreign
currency, with almost 2 million visitors in 1988 spending more than
$2 billion. The Tourism Promotion Board's Moussa wants to double the
number within a few years.
   Moussa said officials recognize the appeal of Egypt's monuments
but must look beyond history to encourage mass tourism.
   ``If you're thinking of coming to Egypt only for its monuments,
you can always put it off, because the monuments will still be
here,'' he said.
   ``Our best bet to help both tourism and monuments is to provide a
number of alternative sites throughout the country, drawing tourists
away from congested monuments. We also can help find ways to stem
the tourist flow into popular sites.''
   Tourism officials and the World Bank have devised a plan they say
will ease congestion in the temples and tombs on Luxor's West Bank.
It includes new roads and a visitors' center that will control
visits to the main attractions by computer.
   Two of the most famous tombs in the Valley of the Kings _ Seti I
and Tutankhamun _ are endangered but remain open to the public.
   A year ago the frail tomb of Seti I was reopened after
restoration. A few weeks later, a zodiac design painted on its
ceiling, unique among Egyptian monuments, came crashing to the floor.
   Workers are restoring the zodiac behind a rope barrier, because
``every time we close Seti, we get objections from tourist
agencies,'' said Upper Egyptian antiquities director Balboush.
   In King Tut's tomb, visited every day of the tourist season by
2,500 and more, scientists found in November that bacteria were
eating away the colorful wall paintings.
   To accommodate tourist traffic, plans were made for restorers to
apply an antidote to the infested walls before and after hours. Once
they saw how serious the infestation was, however, experts decided
to work nonstop for three days.
   Tourists didn't hamper the work: the antidote smelled so foul
that once visitors took a whiff, they rushed out, leaving restorers
to their work.

   The devastating Armenian earthquake posed
important tasks for the Soviet regime: Can it cope with destruction
on such a wide scale? Does it lack the means to mitigate suffering?
Does it have to rely on foreign help to save lives? Does its
entrenched bureaucracy make things worse? Here is a report by an
Associated Press correspondent who spent much time in the quake area.

   The Soviet response to Armenia's devastating
earthquake offered a rare look at the Kremlin's ability to respond
to crisis and revealed logistical and technical weaknesses that
observers say cost many of the estimated 55,000 lives that were lost.
   The country's state-run media, freer under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, pounced on the story and provided
extraordinary coverage to the Soviet people and the world. But the
tragedy only temporarily stalled the bitter territorial dispute
between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   Within hours of the Dec. 7 quake, the Kremlin used its military
and centralized state control to throw doctors and basic aid into
the battle to save lives. But the civil defense system, hampered by
a lack of local leadership, transportation bottlenecks and
organizational problems, bogged down.
   And the rescue effort underlined a shortage of technology and an
inability to shift to sophisticated techniques for finding and
treating victims.
   It is unclear, however, whether any other country faced with a
comparable challenge, with devastation spread over a wide and remote
geographical area, would have fared better in what foreign relief
experts uniformly described as the worst quake they had seen.
   The Kremlin formed a pair of high-level commissions, one led by
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov that arrived in Armenia less than 24
hours after the quake.
   Health Minister Yevgeny Chazov said most hospitals were destroyed
and 70 percent of all local doctors and medical workers were killed.
But military and civilian doctors rushed to the scene conducted
2,500 operations in field conditions and in the open air during the
first 24 hours.
   The Soviet military organized an emergency food supply that held
up well, and kept the damaged cities under guard to ensure order.
   The effort began breaking down because of an absence of
leadership on the local level, the link most weakened by long years
of the central control Gorbachev is trying to change with his
reforms.
   U.N. Disaster Relief officer Sverre Kilde, visiting the shattered
city of Leninakan four days after the earthquake, said, ``The relief
effort until you reach the spot here has been very good. But here on
the spot there is no control.''
   Julia Taft, the head of the U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance
Office, said when her group arrived Sunday, no one directed it to a
specific location. The Americans were told to go wherever they
wanted to work.
   Survivors were picking through the crushed buildings with hand
tools and pleading for more cranes and heavy equipment. ``If the
equipment had come on time, we could have saved many more people,''
said Manuel Zalyan.
   Zalyan was searching a five-story apartment building while a
yellow crane sent the day before, deemed by rescuers too small to be
of any use, sat silently on the adjacent street.
   Ryzhkov ackowledged to reporters that officials were disappointed
with the lack of organization.
   On Dec. 12, the fifth day after the quake, he said there finally
was enough equipment and material help, and that the entire effort
was proceeding ``not badly.''
   But then the weather turned rainy and cold in the remote area
near Turkey in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains _ compounding
problems with earthquake damage to rails and roads, and the
overcrowding of local airports with relief flights.
   Fog turned a confused situation at the Yerevan airport into
chaos. Airlifted supplies were reported to be piling up in Spitak, a
city almost totally destroyed by the quake, and Ms. Taft reported a
shortage of cars and trucks to ferry supplies overland.
   By that time, the rescue and medical needs had become more
sophisticated and the Soviet Union could not keep up without foreign
help. European and American teams with trained dogs and special gear
were brought in to search the rubble for survivors.
   The weekly newspaper Moscow News carped that the Chernobyl
nuclear power accident and a pair of serious railroad accidents
should have proved long ago the need for a Soviet emergency rescue
force.
   It thanked the foreigners for their help, but added, ``We cannot
reconcile ourselves to the fact that our professionals did not
arrive on the scene of the disaster before them.''
   More than 10,000 soldiers were stationed in Leninakan, but they
were assigned to unloading aid shipments at the airport, guarding
roads and distributing food. The search for survivors was left
largely to those whose homes had collapsed and to the foreign rescue
crews.
   Chazov said the centralized system allowed the Soviet Union to
mobilize thousands of medical workers from across the country on
short notice. ``We are very critical of our public health system,
but I think the period we lived through proved its effectiveness,''
he told a Moscow news conference.
   However, he also agreed that a special emergency rescue force was
needed.
   In a country that in the past has pointed to a large number of
doctors and hospitals as proof of the quality of health care,
officials quickly declared that enough medical personnel were on the
scene of the disaster.
   But just as Soviet medical equipment is often less sophisticated
than that available in the West or simply unavailable, the Soviets
this time had to look abroad for important equipment to face medical
emergencies.
   They sent out an urgent plea for dialysis machines to combat the
effects of ``crush syndrome,'' a poisoning of the blood by toxics
released by muscles subjected to heavy pressure for long periods of
time. Chazov said about 500 people were suffering from that
condition.

   A lack of preparation also showed in the shoddy construction of
apartment houses that crumbled on their residents and worsened the
tragedy. Even though Leninakan, Spitak and other northwestern
Armenian cities are in an earthquake zone, the same kinds of
prefabricated apartments were built there as in other parts of the
Soviet Union in the past 20 years.
   In Leninakan, the buildings that fell were largely five- or
nine-story apartment houses that had been built in the last two
decades, a period of chronically poor housing construction caused by
the Soviet Union's hurry to build enough apartments to end a chronic
housing shortage. Older, lower buildings were damaged but generally
stayed up.
   Mayor Emil Kirokasyan of Leninakan told reporters the new
buildings were not constructed to withstand the shock of the
earthquake. Ryzhkov cited ``many violations'' in the construction
and pledged the city would be rebuilt with lower, sturdier
structures.
   The buildings crumbled into such small pieces that there were few
air pockets in which people could survive until rescued, Ms. Taft
said. ``Many blocks were heaps of rubble with no air spaces,'' she
said.
   Gorbachev rushed home from New York, where he had addressed the
United Nations, and made a highly publicized trip to Armenia. He
pledged to investigate the poor housing construction.
   In the spirit of ``glasnost,'' Gorbachev's policy of greater
openness, the official media reported critical comments by Armenians
about a lack of equipment for the rescue effort.
   The nightly news program Vremya expanded to present lengthy
reports from the disaster area, and national newspapers filled their
front and back pages with reports and dramatic pictures of the
rescue efforts. Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper which normally
prints pictures of smiling workers or official meetings on its front
page, printed a photograph of a destroyed building under the
headline, ``Our Pain and Tragedy.''
   Ryzhkov contrasted the outpouring of sympathy and aid from abroad
with the suspicious and critical attitude toward the Soviet Union
after the April 1986 Chernobyl accident.
   The premier said, ``We never before have seen from foreign
countries such warm, human empathy,'' attributing it to Gorbachev's
foreign policy that he declared had eased world tension.
   But the Soviet willingness to publicly come to grips with the
natural disaster also likely played a part in world response. The
Soviet Union tried to hide the Chernobyl accident from the world for
several days, but it reported the earthquake promptly and fully.
   The freer atmosphere Gorbachev has fostered inside the Soviet
Union also meant that this time it was not the response of people of
foreign nationalities that concerned the Kremlin so much as the
reaction of the ethnic groups closest to the disaster.
   Armenians and neighboring Azerbaijanis have been at odds since
February over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.
Armenians, encouraged by the freer atmosphere Gorbachev has
encouraged, had demanded annexation of the region, which is
predominantly ethnic Armenian.
   But the dispute has turned violent, and in the three weeks prior
to the earthquake, 31 people died in attacks of one group upon the
other. More than 180,000 people fled across the border between the
two republics.
   Chazov said Armenian patients were not sent to Azerbaijani
hospitals and that Azerbaijani doctors were not sent to Armenia to
treat earthquake victims.
   Gorbachev, asked on television about the dispute, angrily said
that ``provocateurs'' were trying to use the quake to create
instability, and rejected claims by Armenian activists that the
removal of orphans from the earthquake area was an effort to
``Russify'' it.
   ``What kind of morals do these people have?'' Gorbachev demanded.
``They don't need Karabakh. They are waging a battle for power and
they must be stopped.''

<HEAD>Shifting Demographics Mean Changes in Retailing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retailers' cash registers are beeping and ringing
their way through the Christmas season, but many shoppers are buying
cheaper gifts than in the past.
   Industry observers find that consumers with changing lifestyles
are allocating more money for their homes and less for the things
they don't really need. That means less expensive Christmas gifts,
fewer apparel purchases and, on a much broader scale, some big
changes in the retail industry in the next few years.
   It's all because of shifts in the demographic makeup of this
country. The baby boom generation that is entering or well into
middle age has different interests and needs than it did just a few
years ago.
   Monroe Greenstein, a retail industry analyst with the investment
firm Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., said recently the apparel industry's
year-long sales slump _ which appears to be at an end _ was due in
part to the changes in consumer spending. It was also caused by
women's rejection of the fashions over the past few seasons.
   ``Your priorities change,'' Greenstein said. ``You're concerned
less with apparel and more with what goes into your home.''
   Stacy Ruclamer, of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., agreed with that
hypothesis in a recent analysis. Ms. Ruclamer said the sluggishness
in overall retail spending that has persisted since February 1987
was partly attributable to ``the fact that while the trendsetting
teen-age population was declining ... the maturing baby boomers were
forming households and shifting their buying patterns to many
home-related products.''
   Some retailers have reported brisk business this holiday season
in what's known as ``low-ticket'' items, such as sweaters and
accessories. The biggest sellers at Bloomingdale's in New York
include $25 watches, $64 Calvin Klein sweaters, and $40 bathrobes,
and the store says it's done landmark business in handbags, belts
and scarves.
   K mart Corp., the nation's largest retailer, has also reported
less expensive gifts are the most popular this season.
   Overall, the Christmas season appears to be going well.
   ``I think it's decent so far,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``I think most stores are close to
plan although the numbers are not that robust.''
   Apparel retailers, who were slashing prices a year ago at the
height of their slump, are ``doing very well,'' said Fred Wintzer,
an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons ``They're doing a lot better than
I thought they would.''
   Analysts believe stores will benefit from shifts in the calendar
that add two days to the shopping season this year.
   And, said Wintzer, ``They're all going to get a big sales
increase that last week'' before Christmas.
   Retailers and the analysts who track them had lowered
expectations going into the Christmas shopping season because of the
continuing sluggishness in the industry.
   Consumers have been spending less in stores because of the higher
cost of services, such as medical care and college tuition, and on
their cars and on food. And they've been trying to pay down high
installment debt.
   But the analysts nonetheless expect some retailers to benefit
from the demographic changes.
   Walter Loeb, of Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., predicted, ``the
emphasis for specialty stores in the next decade will change from
apparel fashions to home furnishings.''
   That means retailers like Home Depot and Builders Square, which
specialize in home improvement items like paint, paneling and
hardware, will be in greater demand, Loeb said. So will stores like
Conrans and Pier 1 Imports, which feature home furnishings, he said.
   Other retailers, like K mart, have recognized the trend and are
promoting their home-furnishing or home-improvement segments, Loeb
said.
   The analysts expect to see some leveling off in apparel
retailing, although, as Loeb noted, ``fashion specialists and
department stores with a specific point of view will continue to do
well in the 1990s.''

   In other business news this past week:
   _The Federal Reserve's open market committee met to consider
tightening credit, but by week's end there was no announcement of
changes in the central bank's discount rate.
   _The Commerce Department said the U.S. merchandise trade deficit
for October narrowed slightly to $10.35 billion, but financial
markets were unimpressed by the news. The department also said the

at 84.2 percent of capacity in November, the highest rate in nine
years.
   _The government reported that wholesale prices edged up 0.3
percent in November, for an annual rate of less than 4 percent.
Separately, the government said housing construction last month
reached its highest level in seven months.
   _Pillsbury Co. rejected Grand Metropolitan PLC's sweetened $5.5
billion hostile tender offer. The $63-a-share cash offer for the
food and restaurant company was a $3-a-share increase over Grand
Met's earlier tender offer.
   _Farley Inc. asked West Point-Pepperell Inc. to call a special

<BYLINE>Can Growth Keep Going in 1989?
^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite an abundance of obstacles, many Wall
Street analysts still hold out hope that economic growth can
continue at a respectable pace in 1989.
   Their view is by no means unanimous. The list of worries and
uncertainties in most forecasts as yearend approaches is long and
familiar: Credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve, the budget and
trade deficits, buyout debt, troubled savings institutions, and more.
   Still, economists at First Boston Corp. argue, ``further
improvement in the foreign trade deficit, continuation of the
capital goods boom, and needed inventory restocking should keep the
economy rolling through the first half of 1989.''
   When the economy has stopped growing and slipped into a recession
in the past, First Boston observed, the Fed has usually been
pursuing an emphatic effort to tighten credit in order to restrain
inflation.
   Now, the firm argues, the prospect is for only ``skirmishes
against inflation, which will be insufficient to halt growth.
   ``Thus, a recession is not probable in the foreseeable future. In
1990, the economy may even reaccelerate.''
   Beyond economic circumstances, some observers say the political
cycle makes the timing ripe for a business slowdown, if not a
recession.
   Under this reasoning, a new occupant of the White House such as
President-elect George Bush faces up to hard choices quickly at the
beginning of his term, when action is most possible and the
temporary pain that often results has time to dissipate before the
next election.
   ``Of the last 11 recessions, nine have begun during the first
year of a president's term,'' acknowledges Richard Sichel, director
of research in the trust and investment services group at First
Pennsylvania Bank.
   ``It may take less bitter medicine this time to correct our
ailments. However, investors should emphasize quality, predictable
earnings growth and reasonable valuation,'' Sichel said.
   Investors were indeed playing it cautious in the stock market
this past week, showing little inclination either to buy or to head
for the exits. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 7.22
to 2,150.71.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell .43 to 155.16;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose .60
to 375.80, and the American Stock Exchange market value index was
down .24 at 297.37.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 144.43 million shares a day,
against 141.86 million the week before.
   The sheer length of the current period of economic expansion,
which began in late 1982, is often mentioned as another cause for
pause in assessing the outlook.
   There is no magic number of months or years beyond which the
economy cannot keep growing, analysts say.
   But some who are skeptical about chances for robust growth in
1989 say the expansion of the past six years is showing signs of
having extended itself close to limits of capacity.
   ``Signs have emerged that growth, although currently strong, is
about to slow sharply,'' contends Donald Straszheim, chief economist
at Merrill Lynch.
   ``At best the economy could manage a soft landing with sluggish,
but positive, growth next year. At worst, a downturn could develop
before the end of 1989, but it need not be severe.
   ``We tend to expect a downturn,'' Straszheim concluded. Whatever
else that would mean for the business and investment outlook, he
added, it ``would have the positive side effect of leading to a
sharp decline in interest rates.''

   Profit-taking has helped drive down energy
futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The January contract for wholesale heating oil lost 0.19 cent
Thursday to settle at 50.94 cents a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, after jumping 1.86 cents Wednesday. Strong
gains also were made earlier in the week after the arrival of
sub-freezing temperatures in the Northeast.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange
Thursday, January unleaded gasoline, which rose 0.42 cent on
Wednesday, lost 0.07 cent to settle at 43.65 cents a gallon.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $16.35 a barrel, down 2 cents
from Wednesday, when it rose 37 cents.
   Bud de Gorgue, an energy analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., attributed Thursday's decline mainly to profit-taking
following Wednesday's rally. The strong performance had been fueled
by market optimism that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would stick to a recent production-cutting agreement.
   But de Gorgue said, ``Many traders felt the market was overbought.
   ``You really can't put a lot of faith in the type of rally we've
seen because of the lack of volume. December is typically a slow
month,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lorimar Agrees to Sell Two TV Stations, Could Clear Way For Warner
Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lorimar Telepictures Inc. says its agreement to
sell its Puerto Rican television broadcast interests has cleared the
way for the entertainment company's long-stalled sale to Warner
Communications Inc.
   Lorimar's interest in the two stations as well as its ownership
of a third station in Pittsburgh had been a stumbling block for
Warner's proposed acquisitions of the Culver City, Calif.-based
company in an exchange of stock and debt that has been valued at
about $1.2 billion.
   Lorimar has previously announced plans to sell the Pittsburgh
station, WPGH, in a deal that is expected to be completed in January.
   On Thursday, it said it expects to complete the sale of its
interest in the two Puerto Rican stations, WSUR-TV and WLII-TV,
before the end of the year.
   The buyer was identified as an investor group led by Timothy
Brumlik of Orlando, Fla., who was said to have other television
interests serving the Hispanic market in central Florida. Terms of
the sale were not disclosed.
   As a result of both deals, Lorimar said that its merger with
Warner ``is expected to be consummated in January 1989.''
   Lorimar is a leading supplier of television programming including
such popular shows as ``Dallas,'' ``Knots Landing'' and ``Alf.''
   Warner, a records, film and publishing company based in New York,
proposed in May to acquire Lorimar, which has lost millions of
dollars in recent quarters, in an exchange of stock.
   But Warner's biggest shareholder, Chris-Craft Industries Inc.,
objected to the deal, saying it would violate a 1984 agreement it
signed with Warner when the two companies bought stakes in each
other.
   Chris-Craft, a New York-based media company, bought its stake in
Warner and gave Warner in return a 42.5 percent in its BHC Inc.
subsidiary, which operates a half-dozen television stations.
   Under the terms of the agreement, however, Warner was prevented
from owning other television stations as long as it owns 25 percent
or more of BHC.
   Chris-Craft sued Warner over the Lorimar deal last summer in New
York State Supreme Court.
   Warner proposed putting the Lorimar television stations in a
trust until they could be sold, but the court blocked the merger
until either Warner reduced its stake in BHC below 25 percent or
Lorimar sold the stations.
   Warner appealed the decision, but the lower court's ruling was
affirmed by the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme
Court earlier this week.
   In a statement, Chris-Craft said, ``Hopefully, today's
announcement signals that Warner has finally decided to live up to
its agreement with us.''
   Lorimar announced in August that it had agreed to sell the
Pittsburgh station to Renaissance Communications. The sale is being
reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission, and Lorimar
expects approval by mid-January.
   But a Lorimar spokeswoman, speaking on condition that she not be
identified by name, said the sale of Lorimar's interests in the
Puerto Rican stations is different because Lorimar placed its
interest in the stations in a trust and is selling that rather than
the stations themselves.
   As a result, she said, Lorimar can shed its interest in those
stations without waiting for FCC approval.
   In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Warner was
unchanged at $35.37{ a share. Lorimar rose 12{ cents a share to $12
in trading on the American Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
   Crystal Brands Inc. has announced the
acquisition of rival clothing manufacturer Palm Beach Inc. for $300
million.
   Under the deal announced Thursday, Crystal Brands will refinance
Palm Beach's $205 million debt.
   Crystal Brands acquired the company from an investment group led
by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners that had taken Palm Beach private
through a leveraged buyout in 1985.
   In 1987, Cincinnati-based Palm Beach reported sales of $404
million. Crystal Brands had sales of $360 million the same year.
   ``The addition of Palm Beach will expand dramatically our current
base in apparel,'' said Richard F. Kral, chairman and chief

<HEAD>Ex-NY Fed Reserve Director Pleads Innocent To Insider Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert A. Rough, who has long denied leaking
confidential interest rate data while on the New York Federal
Reserve Bank's board, has formally entered an innocent plea to
insider trading charges.
   Rough was arraigned Thursday before U.S. District Judge Dickinson
R. Debevoise one week after his indictment by a federal grand jury
in Newark.
   Rough is accused of disclosing information on the discount rate
set by the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington to principals at
Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Inc., a brokerage firm based in
Livingston, N.J., that later suffered a $144 million collapse.
   The government said Bevill, Bresler made millions of dollars and
avoided millions in losses because of the information, which Rough
allegedly exchanged for $47,000 in interest-free loans.
   Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, said he would need time to
review thousands of transactions by the firm, which collapsed in
April 1985.
   Debevoise on Thursday set Rough's bail at a $150,000 personal
recognizance bond and limited his travel to New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Washington, D.C.
   A hearing on pre-trial motions was set for Feb. 14, and trial was
scheduled for Feb. 21.
   After the hearing, Himmel and the affable-looking Rough declined
to comment.
   The indictment said that while Rough was president of the
National Bank of Sussex County in Branchville, N.J., and sat on the
New York Fed's board from 1982 to 1984, he regularly leaked advance
word on the local federal reserve's discount rate recommendation to
the national Fed, as well as the Fed's final determination on the
rate.
   The discount rate has a powerful effect on the securities market,
and has been called by Fed officials one of their most closely
guarded secrets. The rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans
to financial institutions and is regarded as an indicator of the
direction in which the Fed is seeking to push interest rates, which
affect the prices of bonds.
   After the Fed learned of the allegations against Rough, which
were first mentioned in April 1987 during testimony at a criminal
trial stemming from the Bevill, Bresler collapse, the bank tightened
procedures for the rate. Rough publicly denied the charges at the
time of the trial, repeating denials to investigators in private
interviews.
   Rough, a former chairman of the New Jersey Bankers Association,
was formally charged with conspiracy to commit wire and securities
fraud, two counts of bank fraud, one count each of wire fraud and
securities fraud and two counts of making false statements to banks.
   Authorities have called it the first case of insider trading
involving government securities and the federal reserve system.
   Rough resigned from Sussex National earlier this year,
prosecutors said.

<HEAD>Ford Converter Announcement Knocks Platinum Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum prices should continue dropping sharply
for the next few days in the wake of Ford Motor Co.'s announcement
of a program to equip some cars with pollution controls that don't
use the precious metal, an analyst says.
   Platinum prices plunged on the New York Mercantile Exchange
Thursday, a day after Ford Chairman Donald Petersen announced in
Pittsburgh a pilot program using catalytic converters without
platinum.
   Ford has released few details of the new converter, which is to
be used in 1989 Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars sold in
California, a state with the toughest air quality standards in the
nation.
   More than 75 percent of the platinum used in the United States is
in converters, which remove some pollutants from automobile exhaust
gases. Petersen made the announcement Wednesday night and that sent
Thursday's platinum prices tumbling.
   Platinum futures contracts for current delivery closed Thursday
at $579.60 a troy ounce at the New York exchange, down $24.90 an
ounce from Wednesday's $604.50 close. The heavily traded contract
for January delivery dropped the daily limit of $25.
   Earlier Thursday, the spot contract price, which is not subject
to the $25 limit, fell more than $60 an ounce before rebounding
prior to the close of trading.
   ``This is actually a collapse,'' precious metals analyst James
Steel of Refco Inc. in New York said. He said the decline came
solely because of Ford's announcement.
   ``In fact, it took everybody by surprise,'' he said. ``If you
asked any analyst, fundamentally they were bullish on platinum. It
looks like the futures are going to lock in at limit-down (the $25
maximum loss) for the next few days at least.''
   Metals analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. agreed.
   ``It is a very bearish indicator for platinum,'' she said.
``There may be other issues as we go on. It's also brought downside
pressure on the other precious metals.''
   Steel said the waves should be felt in Europe, too, where
platinum futures were being bought on expectations of increased used
of catalytic converters there.
   ``It's double-bearish now because we had put in our forecast for
`89 that we were relying on the Europeans to buy more platinum,'' he
said.
   Ford spokesman Bill Peacock declined comment on the reaction of
the commodity market to the company's announcement and declined to
detail any of the specifications of the new converter.
   He and Petersen said the device could save the company a
substantial amount of money. But Peacock did not say if any of the
savings would be passed on to consumers if the device proves
successful.
   He said the device would be installed in 40,000 to 50,000
Thunderbirds and Cougars, both made at a Ford plant in Lorain, Ohio.
   Bill Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board,
confirmed that the cars have been certified to be sold in the state.
   Auto industry analyst Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of
San Francisco said current catalytic converters use about $10 worth
of platinum each, leading him to suggest that cost savings must come
from other areas, such as the cost of applying the platinum in the
converter.
   A catalytic converter is attached to the exhaust system of an
engine. Exhaust gases pass through it and react with a catalyst _
platinum in the current device _ to remove pollutants and produce
harmless materials.
   Peacock said the new device creates no materials other than the
water and carbon dioxide produced by today's converters.
   He declined to speculate on when the new converter could be put
into Ford's full manufacturing process if the pilot program is
successful. He said, however, it would not be during the current
1989 model year, which ends next Sept. 30.
   ``We don't want to be pinned down on a timetable,'' he said. ``It
is a very attractive opportunity because it yields quality and cost
advantages.''

<HEAD>First Interstate Cancels Spin-off of Bad Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp has decided to sell
off hundreds of millions of dollars in bad loans and unprofitable
real estate rather than spin them off into a separate ``bad bank.''
   First Interstate had planned to form a separate company _ the
``bad bank'' _ to handle $400 million in bad loans and unprofitable
real estate.
   But the company said Thursday it had changed its mind, based on a
re-assessment that put the value of the non-performing assets at
$225 million to $250 million rather than the original $400 million.
   The smaller pool of bad loans and real estate would be better
disposed of through sale, the company said. Additionally, because
the amount to be spun off was smaller than originally expected, tax
benefits of the deal weren't as great as planned, it said.
   The original plan would have given First Interstate shareholders
stock in two companies, a bigger, more profitable ``good bank''
shorn of under-performing assets, and the smaller ``bad bank.''
   The change in plan means the bad assets won't be shed by the end
of the first quarter of 1989, as originally thought.
   The asset sales will leave First Interstate with $150 million
more in common equity than would have been the case under the
spinoff, the bank said.
   The plan was part of a restructuring scheme announced in October
1987 to get out of lines of business outside those where the bank
has done best, mainly consumer and middle-market banking in the West.
   First Interstate, which has more than 1,000 banks in 21 states,
is the nation's ninth-largest bank holding company.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Higher Against Yen, Shares Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar closed higher today against the
Japanese yen, while share prices finished lower due to strong
speculation of an impending hike in the U.S. discount rate.
   The dollar closed at 124.10 yen, up 1.13 yen from Thursday's
close of 122.97 yen. After opening at 123.90 yen, the American
currency moved in a wide range of 123.73-124.75 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar strengthened in Tokyo after gains in New
York following an interest rate hike in West Germany, fanning
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve Board may increase its discount
rate, the rate charged on loans to commercial banks.
   ``On a short-term basis, the dollar will remain on a firm note,
aside from the issue of pending U.S. fiscal and trade deficits,''
said Shinichiro Maruyama of the Industrial Bank of Japan's
International Treasury Department.
   Maruyama said Emperor Hirohito's ailing health also contributed
to ``triggering yen-selling.''
   The 87-year-old Hirohito has been bedridden since September,
suffering from internal bleeding.
   On Thursday, the West German Bundesbank raised its Lombard
lending rate from 5 percent to 5.5 percent. The figure is applied to
very short-term borrowings from the bank using securities as
collateral. The West German discount rate remained unchanged at 3.5
percent.
   A higher U.S. discount rate would tend to push up the dollar's
value and make dollar-denominated holdings worth more.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 48.98-point loser Thursday, shed 169.04 points,
or 0.56 percent, closing the week at 29,536.71. Volume trade on the
major first section was 800 million shares, the same amount traded
Thursday.
   Share prices moved up slightly at the start of trading, but fell
a sharp 413.54 points before the afternoon session, which saw a
moderate recovery.
   The market's main index failed to regain its earlier losses on
profit-taking, centering on large-capital issues, in reaction to the
growing concern of higher U.S. interest rates, dealers said.
   ``There's a 50 percent chance whether the Fed will announce a
raise in its official discount rate today,'' said Masahiro Umemori
of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher But Off Best Levels, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was higher in European trading late
this morning but was off its best levels after the West German
central bank reportedly started selling dollars in an attempt to
bring the currency down.
   Gold prices were lower.
   The dollar strengthened in Tokyo and Europe after gains in New
York following an interest rate hike in West Germany, which fanned
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve Board may increase its discount
rate, the rate charged on loans to commercial banks.
   But the Bundesbank, the West German central bank, began selling
dollars at midmorning, driving the dollar down, traders said. The
amounts were small, they said.
   The Bundesbank wouldn't comment on the reports.
   Dealers in Milan were divided on when, or whether, the Federal
Reserve would increase the discount rate.
   ``I don't see the (U.S.) discount rate rising this year. At the
earliest a hike will come in January,'' said one trader with a major
Italian commercial bank.
   Another trader said she thought the Fed would hold off any hike
until 1989 and might try to avoid one altogether. ``I see the Fed
braving it out until January and then seeing what sort of shape the
dollar is in,'' she said.
   One dealer at a major West German bank said that barring massive
interventions, the dollar seemed poised to rise until the end of the
year on commercial demand that had been held back over the past few
months.
   ``Some people had expected new lows, and now they have to move
fast to cover their positions before the end of the year,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.13 yen to a closing 124.10 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 124.18 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.7527 West German marks, up from 1.7485; 1.4765
Swiss francs, up from 1.4725; 5.9885 French francs, up from 5.9745;
1.9726 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9665; 1,292.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,288.00; 1.2055 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2054.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8215, compared with
$1.8280 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $413.30 a troy ounce,
down from $416.45 bid late Thursday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of
$412.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $412, down from $416 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $7.81 to close at a bid $415.24.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.07 a troy ounce,
down from Thursday's $6.11.

November.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices that were flat in October
after three months of fairly large increases are on the rise again,
but not at a dangerously inflationary pace, according to economists.
   With the Labor Department's Producer Price Index figures for
November due out today, the consensus among private analysts was
that wholesale prices rose a modest 0.3 percent last month.
   ``Inflationary fears exceed inflationary reality at the present
time,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at
Georgia State University in Atlanta.
   Any increase higher than 0.3 percent would aggravate inflation
fears triggered by reports earlier this week that factories, mines
and power plants operated at a nine-year high of 84.2 percent of
their capacity in October with industrial production up another half
of a percentage point in November.
   Wholesale price inflation had slowed to zero in October as food
prices that had been rising at an annual rate of 8 percent because
of the summer drought decreased.
   Stable food prices or even another slight decline after seasonal
adjustments showed up in November in private surveys as large hog
slaughters continued to put downward pressure on pork prices.
   Beef prices were up sharply, as were costs for vegetables as they
became seasonally scarce. But those factors were built into the
seasonal adjustments that the government uses.
   Ratajczak said the big propellants of the November price
increases were a firming in oil prices even prior to the
establishment of new production quotas last month by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   He said his own survey showed wholesale gasoline prices rising 2
percent in November and home heat oil spurting up by 6 percent.
However, natural gas prices stabilized after surging by nearly 5
percent in October.
   ``Oil prices probably will end this year slightly higher than
originally expected because of response to the latest OPEC
agreement,'' Ratajczak said. ``However, oil prices are expected to
again decline next spring. This also moderates price gains for
chemicals and plastics.''
   Ratajcak said he expects that for 1988 in total, wholesale prices
will have risen 3.7 percent, compared with 2.2 percent for last
year. For 1989, he is predicting wholesale price inflation of 4.2
percent, with beef and pork costs soaring in the second wave of
aftershocks from last summer's drought.
   ``When the OPEC agreement becomes unmanagable next spring and oil
prices decline once again, commodity inflation should remain
restrained,'' he said. ``In the increasing concern about inflation,
many have failed to note that industrial commodity prices have
increased less in 1988 than in 1987.''

<HEAD>Commodities Salesmen Plead Guilty to Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former salesmen for a failed commodities
trading firm have pleaded guilty to charges they participated in a
scheme to defraud investors of $3.2 million.
   Carl H. Bertrams, 32, Richard K. Shelhamer, 39 and George Y.
Ayling, 37, each pleaded guilty Thursday to two counts of mail fraud
and agreed to cooperate in a continuing investigation of First
Commodities Corp. of Boston.
   The three entered their pleas before U.S. District Judge Nicholas
Bua. They each face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a
$2,000 fine.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michele Smith said she expected a grand
jury to soon indict several managers and salesmen who worked in
First Commodities offices in Chicago and suburban Oak Brook between
1983 and 1987.
   In their guilty pleas, the defendants said they sold commodity
investments over the telephone by following a set script that
downplayed risk and exaggerated profit potential.
   While salesmen stressed the urgency of making an investment
before an impending price increase, new clients who sent in personal
checks had their funds stored temporarily in spread positions that
limited the risk to First Boston should the checks bounce.
   The brokerage's salesmen often favored selling silver contracts
because of the metal's ``glamorous'' image, but also sold
agricultural and financial futures, especially when the season or a
news event would bring a certain product to the public's attention,
the pleas said.
   According to the pleas, the men lied extensively about their
expertise and poor track records, as well as the size and growth of
First Boston.
   Founded in the late 1970s by Don R. Schleicher and his brother,
Richard, the firm rapidly grew into one of the nation's leading
futures trading firms, generating $40 million annually in sales from
offices in Denver, Nevada and California.
   In 1987, the firm collapsed beneath a mountain of investor
lawsuits and investigations by the FBI and other agencies.

<TEXT>
   Belgium's central bank announced on
Friday that it was raising the country's key interest rates for the
second time in less than a week.
   The Belgian National Bank said the discount and lombard rates
would be increased by 0.25 of a percentage point each to respective
rates of 7.75 percent and 8 percent.
   The bank also announced that it was increasing the three-month
Treasury bill rate by a quarter point to 7.65 percent. The
three-month rate is considered to be the most important in Belgian
banking.
   In addition, the bank is raising the one-month Treasury bill rate
to 7.5 percent from 7.35 percent and the two-month rate to 7.5
percent from 7.4 percent.
   The increase in the treasury bill rates takes effect immediately,
while the hike in the discount and lombard rates takes effect on
Monday. The lombard rate is that charged for short-term borrowings
from the central bank using securities as collateral, and the
discount rate is the interest charged commercial banks for loans.
   The Belgian move follows the half point increase in West
Germany's Lombard rate to 5.5 percent, announced on Thursday.
   This is the second time this week that Belgium has increased key
interest rates amid signs of a general rise in interest rates
worldwide.
   On Wednesday the bank announced that it was increasing the
discount and lombard rates by a quarter point each and raised the
three-month rate by a similar margin.

<TEXT>
   Share prices were higher near the day's peak at
midday Friday on British economic figures which have buoyed the
market's mood.
   Dealers said share prices continued to advance on the growing
belief that the British government won't have to increase interest
rates further to slow down inflationary pressures on the British
economy.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 9.3
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,772.5 at about 12:45 p.m., near the
morning peak of 9.9 points up.
   Volume was a moderate 235.8 million shares compared with 228.7
million shares at the same time Thursday.
   Dealers said the market has been gradually shaking off its
previous concerns about the effects of high interest rates on
British corporate profitability. Until recently, many analysts
thought the government would have to push base lending rates above
the current 13 percent level to slow down the British economy and
choke off inflation.
   But recent economic figures, especially average earnings figures
released Thursday and retail sales figures published last Monday,
have suggested the economy is already responding to higher rates.
   On Friday, the government reported that the annual rate of
inflation held steady at 6.4 percent in November.

<HEAD>Britain's Annual Inflation Rate Holds Steady at 6.4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's annual inflation rate held steady at 6.4
percent in November, the government said Friday, in the latest in a
series of economic reports which have somewhat eased concerns about
resurgent inflation.
   However retail prices rose 0.5 percent in November from the
previous month, the Department of Employment said, and Employment
Secretary Norman Fowler said, ``There can be no grounds for
complacency.''
   Fighting inflation ``remains a clear priority,'' the secretary
said.
   The government has pushed up interest rates to 13 percent from a
decade low of 7.5 percent in June to discourage consumer spending
and choke off inflation, which has increased from a 3.3 percent
annual rate in January.
   In October, the retail price index rose 1 percent from the
previous month and was up 6.4 percent from a year earlier.
   Market expectations had been for an annual inflation rate of
between 6.3 percent and 6.5 percent in November.
   The department said that the rise between October and November
mainly reflects increases in mortgage interest rates, as well as
higher prices for some foods, clothing and footwear. Excluding
mortgage interest payments, retail prices rose by 5.1 percent on
average in the year to November, the department said.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 110.0
in November, up from 109.5 in October, and from in 103.4 November
1987.
   Fowler noted Thursday's news that the underlying annual rate of
increase in earnings fell to 9 percent in October from 9.25 percent
in September, but said the growth of earnings still remains too high.
   ``Moderation in pay settlements remains essential for the economy
and for jobs,'' he said.
   On Monday, the government reported that retail sales fell 0.5
percent in November.

   The past year has provided plenty of support for
those pundits who argue that corporate earnings don't matter much to
the stock market.
   When all the results are in, Standard & Poor's Corp. estimates,
corporate earnings for 1988 will be up as much as 40 percent from
last year, on top of a 21 percent increase in 1987.
   Yet S&P's 500-stock composite index showed a gain for the year of
only about 11.5 percent as of mid-December.
   The numbers also reflect badly on the image of the market as a
mechanism that anticipates _ or ``discounts,'' in Wall Street
parlance _ trends in corporate earnings six months to a year in the
future.
   The market's crash in 1987, and the meager increase it posted for
the year as a whole, hardly appear to have been accurate foretokens
of where earnings were headed in 1988.
   And these days, of course, the market seems to swoon every time
it is confronted with evidence that the economy remains strong and
is supporting continued growth in profits.
   Will all that, however, some analysts say the sharp increases in
earnings this year have done the market a lot of good.
   When the price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 soared over 20 to 1
in the summer of 1987, they say, it reached dangerously overvalued
levels and had to come down one way or another.
   The first part of that reduction, to about 15 to 1, was achieved
by a drastic drop in stock prices in the fall of last year.
   Since then, by contrast, the market PE has been lowered further
in a far more constructive way through earnings increases, rather
than reductions in stock prices.
   The S&P 500 lately has traded at just under 12 times the last 12
months' earnings reported by the stocks that make up the index.
   Analysts at the firm's weekly publication The Outlook say the
multiple is barely more than 10 if you calculate it on the basis of
their earnings projections for 1989. It hasn't been that low since
1984.
   There is nothing to prevent the market PE from falling even
further. Indeed, it spent more than five years below 10 in the late
1970s and early 1980s.
   However, many market-watchers argue, at its current levels the PE
indicates that stocks aren't puffed up by overly optimistic
expectations.
   ``Last year's crash was triggered by fundamental overvaluation of
stocks,'' says Norman Fosback in the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based
investment advisory letter Market Logic.
   ``Although price levels are the same now as they were in early
1987, underlying fundamentals have improved substantially.
   ``Earnings and dividends have grown, and continue to grow, and at
current levels will readily support substantially higher prices than
prevail today.
   ``Given the present reasonable valuation levels, moderate
monetary policies and modest economic growth, there is no reason why
the stock market cannot continue to advance, not only over the
course of 1989, but into the 1990s.''
   S&P's analysts aren't so sanguine about the market's 1989
prospects. They predict a ``bumpy'' market that may end the year 5
percent to 10 percent below its recent levels.
   But, looking at PE ratios, they also observe, ``stock valuations
are generally reasonable. Thus, long-term investors shouldn't
hesitate to accumulate stocks of companies with good earnings
visibility and strong balance sheets.''
   Maybe it's hard to see any year-by-year correlation between
trends in stock prices and earnings, analysts like these contend,
but over the long haul rising earnings count for a lot.

   The stock market gained ground today in activity
swelled by program traders at the quarterly ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.36 to 2,140.36 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 527 up, 376 down and
573 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 70.96 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Some December futures contracts on stock indexes were settled as
of the opening today, while others were to be settled at the close
of trading.
   That prompted extra activity by program traders closing out their
positions. But, as has been the case in several recent witching
hours, it did not produce much in the way of extra volatility in
stock prices.
   Aside from the witching hour, analysts said traders were still
watching warily for signs of the future course of interest rates.
   The Federal Reserve is generally believed to have tightened
credit a notch further this week.
   In the economic news, the government reported that the producer
price of finished goods rose 0.3 percent in November, in line with
advance estimates.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up \ at 45\; General
Electric, up [ at 44~; American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at 29|,
and Merck, up { at 57].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.35 to 154.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .65 at 294.96.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.25 to
2,133.00, bringing its loss since the start of the week to 10.49
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 537 up, 867 down and 534 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 136.82 million shares, against 132.35
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>EEC To Discuss Meat Hormone Dispute with the U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European foreign ministers will refine
next week their retaliatory plans if a trade war breaks out over a
scheduled ban on hormone-treated meat from the United States,
officials said Friday.
   The ministers of the European Economic Community will discuss the
dispute Monday at a regularly scheduled meeting in Brussels,
according to a spokeswoman for the 12-nation trading bloc.
   The community wants to ban for health reasons all meat from
animals treated with growth hormones. Late last year, it agreed to
delay implementation of the prohibition until Jan. 1.
   An estimated $170 million of U.S. meat exports would be affected
by the ban.
   The United States has threatened to take retaliatory action if
the prohibiton is imposed by slapping duties on a variety of
products imported from the trading bloc. The United States argues
that the use of certain hormones to fatten animals, a common
practice among American farmers, is not a health risk.
   The EEC has, in turn, promised to retaliate if any extra duties
are imposed on its products.
   A spokeswoman for the trading bloc, who requested anonymity, said
the EEC has drawn up a draft plan that would single out for
retaliation four American products _ natural honey, unshelled nuts,
dried fruit and canned corn _ exported to the community.
   She did not specify what sort of restrictions would be placed on
those products, only that such action would depend on the U.S.
response. Other products could also be added to the list, she said.
   Discussions were continuing to try to resolve the dispute.
   Officials from both sides also were expected to discuss the issue
Tuesday when they gather in Geneva for a meeting of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 96-nation world trade
organization.

<TEXT>
   USAir has appealed to the National Mediation
Board for a recount of an election in which the Teamsters narrowly
claimed victory to represent 3,700 fleet service workers in 100 U.S.
cities.
   The airline also asked the board to reconsider an earlier
decision that prevented voting by a number of other employees,
presumed to support management against the union.
   The two-member mediation board was to receive the airline's
request today in Washington, D.C., but might not act immediately,
said board spokesman Charles Barnes.
   The mediation board credited the union with 1,867 votes, four
more than the majority it needed to win.
   William Genoese, director of the Teamsters' airline division,
called the recount request a ``frivolous and desperate attempt to
cloud the issues and block certification.''
   Had the union lost, it would have been forced to withdraw as
bargaining agent for 2,000 fleet service workers it had been
representing in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Buffalo and Boston.
   ``We were expecting more, but a win is a win is a win,'' said
Vince Hickman, business representative for Teamsters Local 732 at
Greater Pittsburgh International Airport.
   Contract talks have been stalled for more than a year.
   ``We're very up,'' Genoese said. ``We're ready to sit down and
negotiate.''

   Mediated contract talks between Northwest
Airlines and the union representing the carrier's 4,800 pilots will
begin in earnest Jan. 4, a company spokesman said Friday.
   Northwest officials and leaders of the Air Line Pilots
Association met in separate and joint meetings this week with
federal mediator Robert Brown, said Alan Muncaster, a spokesman for
Northwest.
   The meetings were designed to provide Brown with background on
the labor dispute, Muncaster said.
   The parties agreed Thursday to adjourn and begin a full round of
joint talks Jan. 4, Muncaster said.
   The pilots and the airline were millions of dollars apart when
Northwest requested mediation in mid-November. The call for
mediation temporarily ended the union's strike threat. The pilots
voted overwhelmingly to walk off their jobs, but said they would
abide by laws that make a strike illegal during mediation.
   One of the sticking points in the negotiations is how to merge
the seniority rights of pilots in the aftermath of the 1986
acquisition of Republic Airlines. Pilots from the two carriers had
been working under separate contracts until they expired.

<HEAD>Say Bilzerian Targeted for Two Felony Indictments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Manhattan federal grand jury investigating
takeover investor and Singer Co. chairman Paul Bilzerian is expected
to indict him on two securities fraud charges, the Wall Street
Journal reported Friday.
   Quoting unidentified people it said were familiar with the
investigation, the newspaper said the charges could come as early as
next week and will focus on at least two takeover situations in
which Bilzerian was involved concerning H.H. Robertson Co. and
Hammermill Paper Co.
   The Journal said one of the impending charges evidently stems
from disclosures by Boyd L. Jefferies, a Los Angeles broker who
turned state's evidence in March 1987 after he was implicated in
securities violations by Ivan F. Boesky, the infamous insider trader
now serving a three-year prison term.
   The other charge was said to concern allegedly false disclosures
Bilzerian made to the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a
source of money to be used to buy securities.
   Bilzerian, a one-time real estate investor with residences in
Florida and California, has been one of the most active investors in
takeover targets. He won control of Singer Co. for $1.06 billion
after a lengthy fight with the defense contractor's management and
is currently chairman of that company.
   Bruce Baird, the Manhattan assistant U.S. attorney for securities
and commodities fraud, declined to comment on the Journal story.
   Neither Bilzerian nor his lawyer, Arthur F. Mathews, returned
telephone calls for comment, and Jefferies' lawyer Kevin T. Rover
declined to comment.
   Bilzerian reportedly has been under investigation for months
regarding questionable trading activities. The Journal quoted people
familiar with the probe as saying the indictments expected against
Bilzerian represent only a portion of matters involving him and more
charges may be sought.
   The investor made an unsuccessful run at Hammermill Paper two
years ago but ultimately walked away with a big profit by pushing
the Erie, Pa.-based concern into a friendly merger with
International Paper Co. In 1985 he made a failed bid for
Pittsburgh-based H.H. Robertson, a construction materials concern.

<HEAD>Suitor Raises Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Massachusetts company seeking to purchase
Universal Foods Corp. has increased its cash tender offer to more
than $600 million just one week after its initial takeover bid was
rejected.
   Amanda Acquisition Corp., a subsidiary of High Voltage
Engineering Corp., of Burlington, Mass., had offered $30.50 in cash
for all of the outstanding shares of Universal Foods.
   Universal Foods' board of directors last week voted unanimously
against the bid, and said it ``reaffirmed its commitment to remain
an independent company.''
   But Amanda on Thursday increased its offer to $35 a share.
Clifford Press, deputy chairman of High Voltage, said the deal would
amount to $615.6 million for the 17.1 million outstanding shares.
   ``It seems to us that you should be interested in exploring, and
Universal's shareholders are certainly entitled to decide for
themselves, whether the premium price that we are offering is fair
and adequate in view of the company's past performance and future
prospects,'' Press said in a letter to Universal's board.
   Paula C. Norton, Universal's director of corporate
communications, confirmed receipt of the new offer late Thursday.
   ``We did receive the increased offer,'' Norton said. ``Management
will take this offer to the board of directors, which will meet in
due course.''
   Amanda began its acquisition bid Dec. 2 and its tender offer is
scheduled to expire at midnight Dec. 30 unless otherwise extended.
   ``We continue to believe that our acquisition can be achieved and
we intend to consumate it,'' Press said. ``We are also mindful that
it is to everyone's advantage that the acquisition be accomplished
speedily, without causing otherwide unavoidable disruptions and
uncertainties to the company's business.''
   Press said he hoped to encourage the board not to exercise a
recently adopted ``poison pill'' provision aimed at blocking
unwanted takeovers.
   The poison bill gives the company's board and shareholders power
to increase the price of a takeover by issuing a large amount of
stock.
   The price of Universal stock rose 12{ cents to $34.125 per share
at the close of trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Universal Foods makes and markets specialized food ingredients as
well as retail food items.

   Poultry farmers have gone from wringing their hands
to wringing the necks of their birds as the public has lost its
taste for eggs.
   And the government, which has stood by a minister who said most
eggs are tainted by salmonella, today began dishing out $925,000 for
newspaper ads saying there is ``very little risk'' to the public.
   ``Well,'' Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock demanded in the House
of Commons on Thursday, ``Which is it?''
   ``We are aware of the deep problems facing the egg industry,''
said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   However, she said, 1,000 Britishers have come down with
salmonella this year because of bad eggs and the government has a
duty to publicize the best medical advice.
   The advertisements warn against using against uncooked eggs in
such foods as homemade mayonnaise and Yuletide eggnog. Firmly cooked
eggs are prescribed for the sick, elderly, infants or pregnant women.
   The ads say the incidence of salmonella is ``very small'' in a
country that used to put away 200 million eggs a week _ about four
per week per person.
   The egg row has raged in Parliament and the press since Dec. 3,
when Health Minister Edwina Currie said most of the country's egg
production is infected with salmonella.
   Consumption dropped 30 percent to 60 percent, according to
producers, or 10-15 percent according to supermarket chains.
   Conservative members of Parliament from rural districts have
joined opposition lawmakers in calling for Mrs. Currie's head.
   ``In this case, careless talk is costing jobs, it's causing
bankruptcies and it's caused hundreds of chickens in my constituency
to be slaughtered this week,'' David Steel, the former Liberal Party
leader, said in the Commons Thursday.
   Mrs. Currie quit today, after conferring with Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``I think in all the circumstances it is the best course,'' she
said in a letter to Mrs. Thatcher which was released to reporters.
   Mrs. Thatcher wrote accepting the resignation ``with great
personal sadness.''
   With inventories growing, producers announced Wednesday that 1
million eggs were being donated to Armenian relief.
   Chris Kirkwood, who keeps 100,000 chickens on his farm in
Rimswell in northern England, said he has been killing 5,000 hens a
day and booked 20,000 more for a slaughterhouse.
   ``Wringing the hens' necks is very upsetting for the men,''
Kirkwood told The Daily Telegraph.
   Mrs. Thatcher felt obliged to reveal to the House of Commons last
week that she had eaten scrambled eggs on toast for lunch, ``and I
enjoyed it.''
   Robert Hicks, a Conservative lawmaker, disclosed that he and Mrs.
Currie's boss, Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke, often enjoyed a
lunch of ``beer, a cigar and two Scotch eggs, none of which our
honorable friend seems to approve of.''
   Love of Scotch eggs _ a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage,
breaded and deep-fried _ was one of the things Mrs. Currie
apparently had in mind in September when she chided northerners for
eating too much fat.
   Controversy ensued, as it did when Mrs. Currie advised pensioners
to knit wool caps and sweaters if they couldn't afford heat, or when
she said that ``good Christian people who wouldn't dream of
misbehaving'' were at no risk of contracting AIDS.

   MiniScribe Corp., a computer disk company,
has announced it will lay off about 2,000 people over the next four
to five weeks.
   Q.T. Wiles, chairman and chief executive officer, said Thursday
that about 240 employees will be laid off in the firm's Longmont
plant and the balance will be in Far East facilities in Singapore
and Hong Kong.
   He said natural attrition is expected to account for a portion of
the overall reduction over the five-week period.
   Wiles said the reduction was necessary because of lagging sales
and overproduction.
   The layoffs will reduce the company's workforce in Longmont to
1,460 and overseas to about 6,500, said company spokeswoman Jean
Boyd.
   MiniScribe has reduced 1988 sales projections from $750 million
earlier this year to between $630 million and $640 million _ a
decrease of 15 percent.
   Pre-tax profit, however, will range from $55 million to $60
million in 1988 _ about 75 percent above 1987 figures.
   Analysts said makers of computer disk drives overestimated the
market this year. California-based Seagate, which has a plant in
Boulder, Colo., and competes with MiniScribe, announced a 25 percent
reduction in its workforce _ about 1,000 employees _ last week.

<TEXT>
   Platinum futures fell sharply Friday in Tokyo,
following the previous day's plunges in other major markets on news
that Ford Motor Co. had developed a catalytic converter that doesn't
use the metal.
   The near platinum future contract opened sharply lower and fell
further during the day, while all other contracts opened and closed
at their daily lower limits on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange for
Industry.
   Catalytic converters account for about a third of the annual
consumption of the world's newly mined platinum.
   Ford announced Thursday it would test the newly developed
catalytic converters in a limited pilot program but didn't say what
material the device used in place of platinum.
   The near December platinum futures on the exchange tumbled by 9.6
percent from Thursday's close to finish at 2,089 yen per gram, the
equivalent of about $679 a troy ounce.
   All other contracts opened at their lower daily price limit and
stayed there throughout the day.
   The January 1988 contract closed at 2,108 yen per gram, about
$685 a troy ounce at current exchange rates, down about 8.7 percent
from Thursday's close.
   The price limit on the Tokyo commodities exchange, as is the case
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, doesn't apply to the near
contract.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower,
then turned narrowly mixed in early trading today on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Buying interest surfaced in the corn market on talk that the
Soviet Union would need to buy more corn for near-term delivery than
had previously been expected, analysts said.
   Rumors abounded on Thursday that the Soviets were in the market
for 2 million metric tons of U.S. corn. Today, traders were saying
the Soviet Union may need to buy 5 million metric tons of corn for
near-term delivery.
   ``That would put them over the market's most optimistic
projections,'' said Steve Freed, a grain-market analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybeans opened lower, then steadied on reduced chances for
weekend rain in the South American soybean belt, analysts said.
   Wheat prices were little changed.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents lower to { cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.28 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to { cent lower with December at $2.68 a bushel; oats were

soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents higher with January at $7.73 a

   Cattle futures settled mixed on Thursday while pork futures

   A federal jury has awarded more than $7 million
in damages to the families of two men who were exposed to asbestos
while working at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
   One of the men died in 1987 of a lung disease called asbestosis
and the other man is ill with the same ailment.
   The judgments Thursday were brought against three companies which
manufactured insulation containing asbestos: Owens-Illinois Inc. of
Toledo, Ohio; Raymark Industries Inc. of Trumbull, Conn.; and
Celotex Corp. of Tampa, Fla.
   The families' product liability suits, brought in federal court,
were consolidated because they involved the same companies and the
same workplace.
   A six-member civil jury awarded $4 million in compensatory and
punitive damages to Gertrude Higgins of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., whose
husband, John, died last year at age 72.
   Higgins worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard from 1945 to 1965 as a
``chipper and caulker,'' checking to make sure compartments on ships
were welded correctly and watertight, said the family's attorney,
Steven Phillips.
   He was diagnosed as having asbestosis, a lung disease contracted
by exposure to asbestos, in 1980.
   The jury awarded $3.15 million to John and Ann Marie Johnson of
Baldwin, N.Y.
   Phillips, who also represented the Johnsons, said Higgins worked
as an electrician at the Navy Yard during World War II. He is now in
the beginning stages of asbestosis, which takes years to develop.
   Both men were exposed to insulation containing asbestos, which
was wrapped around pipes and machinery on the ships, Phillips said.
   The jury found there was ``clear and convincing'' evidence that
the companies were ``wanton and reckless'' in marketing the
asbestos-tainted insulation.
   Phillips said he presented numerous medical studies about the
dangers of asbestos and internal company memos as evidence at the
five-week trial before U.S. District Judge Charles Sifton.
   John Hoff, a spokesman for Owens-Illinois, declined comment on
the jury verdict. Messages left for comment with the other two
companies were not returned.

   The stock market managed a modest advance today
in activity swelled by program traders at the quarterly ``triple
witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.46 to 2,139.46 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 679 up, 577 down and
553 unchanged.
   Some December futures contracts on stock indexes were settled as
of the opening today, while others were to be settled at the close
of trading.
   That prompted extra activity by program traders closing out their
positions. But, as has been the case in several recent witching
hours, it did not produce much in the way of extra volatility in
stock prices.
   Aside from the witching hour, analysts said traders were still
watching warily for signs of the future course of interest rates.
   The Federal Reserve is generally believed to have tightened
credit a notch further this week.
   In the economic news, the government reported that the producer
price of finished goods rose 0.3 percent in November, in line with

<HEAD>Grumman Corporation Announces Major Layoffs to Begin in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHPAGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grumman Corp. plans to lay off about 10
percent of its workforce or 3,100 employees by the end of 1989,
including 2,500 from its main operations in Long Island, the
military contractor announced today.
   The layoffs will begin in early January, with notices sent to
1,800 workers from various managerial and personnel departments,
said Grumman spokesman Bob Harwood.
   According to Harwood, the company will eliminate any unnecessary
jobs not directly involved in production. He said some production
people will be affected but most of the layoffs will be in overhead
and managerial positions.
   ``We are going to eliminate jobs we (Grumman) don't need in areas
such as security, personnel, public relations, business
operations,'' Harwood said.
   Harwood said all layoffs within the past two years have been
caused by declining defense spending, which has increased pressures
to cut costs.
   ``For us to stay competitive we have to cut cost and cutting cost
translates to cutting people,'' he said.
   ``Our whole industry is facing flat or declining budgets,'' said
Grumman Chairman John O'Brien.
   In the past two years Grumman has been bumped from three major
military aircraft contracts. According to Harwood, in 1987 a
contract to produce the Navy's Advanced Tactical Aircraft was
awarded to McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics in St. Louis.
Grumman also was shut out from producing the Air Force's Advanced
Tactical Fighter.
   During that time, the company fired 1,400 Long Island employees.
   According to Harwood, the ATA would eventually replace the A-6E,
a Navy bomber which is one of Grumman's most-produced aircraft.
   This year, the government stopped development plans for an
upgraded version bomber, the A-6G. That plan would have generated
1,000 new engineer positions and brought in a quarter-of-a billion
dollars annually.
   Out of the company's 32,000 workers, 21,000 are employed on Long
Island.

<TEXT>
   Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits must
give five days notice if it decides to go ahead with efforts to take
over Church's Fried Chicken before a court ruling on Church's
pending appeal, a federal court says.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal on Thursday ordered New
Orleans-based Popeyes not to buy Church's stock without notice until
the Jan. 12 hearing on the San Antonio-based company's fight against
a takeover.
   Church's has asked the 5th Circuit to stop Popeyes $290 million
takeover bid, claiming it is based on information misappropriated by
two former Church's employees now working for Popeyes.
   Ernest E. Renaud, president of Church's, called the ruling a
victory for his company, the No. 2 fried chicken outlet in the
country.
   ``Popeyes isn't going anywhere for the time being and I believe
we have a good shot at winning on appeal because the case law is in
Church's favor,'' Renaud said.
   Popeyes attorney, Peter Butler, said the ruling doesn't slow down
the effort by Popeyes' owner Al Copeland to buy Church's stock with
an $8-dollar-a-share tender offer, which expires tonight. Church's
board of directors is trying to find other buyers to fend off
Popeyes buyout offer, which it has said is not enough.
   ``We're delighted,'' Butler said. ``The ruling still allows us to
disseminate our disclosures as ordered by the district court, and
get the clock moving toward having that injunction lifted.''
   U. S. District Court Judge Charles Schwartz refused to stop
Popeyes effort to take over Church's but ordered that it not proceed
until 10 days after the company disclosed further information to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and Church's stockholders.
   ``Actually, the action by the 5th Circuit does nothing to set us
back and we will be getting one primary obstacle lifted once the
10-day period is over and the district court injunction is lifted,''
Butler said.

<TEXT>
   Federal Express Corp. plans to purchase
Tiger International Inc., parent of the Flying Tigers air shipping
service, for $851.7 million, officials from both companies said
today.
   If completed, the buyout will combine Federal, the nation's
biggest package shipper with a company that has undergone major
restructurings in recent years to cope with financial problems.
   Los Angeles-based Tiger International will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Federal Express, officials said.
   Under the agreement approved by the boards of directors of both
companies, Federal Express will make a $20.87{ a share cash tender
offer for all Tiger International's 40.8 million common shares and
equivalents.
   Tiger International stock jumped $2.50 to $19.37{ a share in
early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Federal Express dipped
50 cents to $46.75 on the American Stock Exchange.
   The offer is conditioned on at least 50.1 percent of the Flying
Tigers stock being tendered.
   The merger is subject to the approval of U.S. Department of
Transportation and the Department of Justice.
   In connection with the merger, Flying Tigers granted Federal the
option to purchase for $20.87{ a share authorized and unissued
shares of Tigers common stock amounting to 22 percent of the
outstanding fully diluted shares.
   Such an option commonly is known as a ``lockup'' and generally is
used to discourage competing suitors.
   Federal Express was granted the option to purchase Tiger shares
owned by Reliance Group Holdings Inc., amounting to 14.8 percent of
outstanding fully diluted shares, at the same price being offered to
all other shareholders.
   Federal Express has a fleet of 221 aircraft and 63,000 employees
worldwide. Flying Tigers has 38 aircraft and 6,300 employees
worldwide.
   Frederick Smith, chief executive officer for Federal Express,
said: ``The combination of Flying Tiger's international route
authorities, highly efficient cargo fleet and strategically located
airport facilities will enable Federal Express to accelerate the
development of its global distribution network.''
   ``While our two businesses have to date served different markets,
we believe the merger will result in significant operating
efficiencies which will benefit our respective customers,'' he said.
   Saul P. Steinberg, chairman of Flying Tigers International Inc.,
and chairman and chief executive officer of Reliance Group Holdings
Inc., said the agreement provides all Tiger shareholders with
excellent value for their investment.
   ``We have been a long-term investor in Tiger and have supported
the company through a highly successful turnaround,'' he said. ``Its
merger with Federal Express will open up new avenues for growth for
the combined companies.''
   Federal Express posted a profit of $118.8 million, or $2.28 per
share, on revenue of $2.2 billion for the first six months of its
fiscal year.
   Tiger International posted a profit of $56.6 million, or $1.52 a
share, in the first nine months of its fiscal year, up from $45.2
million, or $1.22 a share, in the same period a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $986.7 million from $878.7 million.
   The company disclosed earlier this week that it had been
approached by a possible suitor. Earlier this month, The company
said Steinberg, who also heads Reliance Group, was considering
making a proposal to acquire the Tiger International stock Reliance
did not already own.
   At the time, some analysts speculated Steinberg may have made the
overture in order to attract other potential bidders.

<HEAD>British Government Gives Kuwait Three Years to Sell BP Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Friday it would allow Kuwait up
to three years to reduce its holding in British Petroleum Co. PLC to
9.9 percent from 21.68 percent.
   The period represents a compromise between the five years sought
by the Kuwait Investment Office, which is the London-based
investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, and the one year
originally recommended by the British Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young in October ordered Kuwait to reduce
its BP holding to 9.9 percent after the monopolies commission said a
larger holding by Kuwait ``might be expected to operate against the
public interest.''
   The commission cited Kuwait's role as a member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The Kuwaiti office was satisfied with the three-year divestment
period, said John Jeffrey of Stephenson Harwod, the office's law
firm. The time span gives the office sufficient leeway to minimize
its losses, Jeffrey said.
   In recommending a one-year divestment period, the monopolies
commission had said the timing of the sale should be subject to some
flexibility in light of current stock market conditions.
   The Kuwait Investment Office built up its BP holding, amounting
to 1.316 billion shares, by purchasing partly-paid BP stock in the
months following the British government's $13.2 billion public
offering of BP shares in October 1987, which coincided with the
stock market crash.
   The offering, which was far undersubscribed, included the
government's remaining 31.5 percent stake in BP, plus $2.7 billion
worth of new BP shares.
   Kuwait must sell around 700 million shares to reduce its holding
to the required level.
   Analysts recently have speculated that BP might be planning to
buy back the Kuwaiti-held shares.
   The speculation was prompted by BP's confirmation this week that
it is negotiating to sell most of its mineral assets to RTZ Corp.
Analysts say the sale could be raise about $3.5 billion.
   Once the Kuwaiti office has made the final payment on the partly
paid shares next April, the 700 million shares to be disposed of
will be worth around $3.3 billion.
   BP refused to comment on the timetable, or on speculation about a
share buyback.
   BP shares closed up 2 pence, about 4 cents, at 259 pence, or
$4.74, Friday on the London Stock Exchange.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC announced Friday it was
buying Sears PLC's William Hill betting chain for about $606 million
cash, more than doubling the size of Grand Met's British betting
operations.
   Grand Met, a major British liquor, food and retailing company, is
pursuing a $5.49 billion hostile bid for U.S.-based Pillsbury Co.
   William Hill will give Grand Met another 900 betting outlets in
Britain, adding to the 800 outlets Grand Met already owns through
its Mecca betting chain.
   The combination will give Grand Met a betting division the same
size as that of Ladbroke Group PLC, the largest British betting
company.
   William Hill also has around 400 betting shops in Belgium.
   William Hill is expected to report trading profit of 23 million
pounds, about $42 million at current exchange rates, in the year
ending Jan. 31, 1989, up 31 percent from 17.5 million pounds, about
$32 million, in the previous year, Grand Met said.
   Sears, a retailer with no ties to the U.S. retailer of the same
name, said proceeds of the sale would be used to reduce its
borrowing.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose Friday against major currencies in
Europe as traders hedged their positions amid speculation of an
imminent rise in U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices fell in nervous trading triggered by a slump in
platinum prices.
   The dollar ended the week higher against all key currencies
compared with last Friday's late levels.
   Dealers said the dollar moved up sharply in late trading partly
because trading volume was relatively light.
   The dollar began rising Thursday following interest rate hikes in
West Germany and Austria, which fanned speculation that the U.S.
Federal Reserve might increase its discount rate, the rate charged
on loans to commercial banks.
   But some analysts said the Fed's 6.5 percent discount rate would
remain unchanged at least until the end of the year because of fears
that an increase could disrupt stock markets in thin pre-Christmas
trading.
   Traders said the Bundesbank, the West German central bank, sold a
small amount of dollars in morning trading but said the intervention
had little impact on the dollar's rise.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.13 Japanese yen to a closing 124.10
yen, and edged up later in London to 124.22 yen. The dollar closed
last Friday in London at 122.43 yen in London.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8150 from $1.8280 late
Thursday and $1.8490 late last Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.7635 West German marks, up from 1.7485; 1.4895
Swiss francs, up from 1.4725; 5.9950 French francs, up from 5.9745;
1.9805 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9665; 1,296.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,288.00; and 1.2055 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2054.
   Gold prices fell about $4 a troy ounce in nervous European
trading. The market has been unsetled by a $70 dollar-an-ounce slump
in platinum prices since Ford Motor Co. announced Thursday that it
had developed a platinum-free auto exhaust system.
   Catalytic converters account for about a third of the world
consumption of newly mined platinum.
   Gold fell in both London and Zurich to a late bid of $412.25 a
troy ounce, down from $416.45 bid in London and $416 bid in Zurich
late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $7.81 to close at a bid of
$415.24.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $6.12 a troy ounce
from $6.11 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>Platinum Crash: Outlook Brightens As Facts Filter In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bull market for platinum looked to be about as close to a
sure thing as commodities speculators were likely to find. Supplies
were down, consumption was up and demand was expected to outstrip
production for years to come.
   Then _ wham _ the bottom fell out Thursday on sketchy news about
an experimental device for controlling auto pollution, sending
investors scrambling for cover.
   Market analysts proclaimed a catastrophe and went looking for
silver linings.
   They found some, and it didn't take long. By Friday morning, some
were saying the market had overreacted to Ford Motor Co.'s
announcement of a platinum-free catalytic converter. At least one
analyst, Richard Levine of Elders Futures Inc., said the sharp
decline in the metal's value _ from $600 to about $520 an ounce on
the cash market _ represented ``a very good buying opportunity.''
   What happened?
   The best place to start is a 24-page review of the platinum
market published Nov. 15 by London-based Johnson Matthey PLC, the
world's largest platinum refiner.
   In its report, Johnson Matthey predicted a supply shortfall for
platinum for the next five years, including a record 465,000-ounce
shortfall in 1988.
   Platinum is an essential element in today's automobile
pollution-control systems. The metal, in conjunction with certain
other metals, acts as a catalyst in chemical reactions that convert
harmful exhaust pollutants into harmless carbon dioxide and water.
This process occurs inside metal boxes called catalytic converters
that have been required since 1975 on all cars sold in the United
States.
   Johnson Matthey said it expected the use of platinum in catalytic
converters in 1988 to account for nearly 75 percent of platinum
demand in North America and for more than a third of world demand
for the metal.
   And the refiner said new pollution standards in Europe would
contribute to a steady increase in global platinum demand for the
next six years.
   All this amounted to an extremely bullish outlook for platinum
prices. Investor dollars streamed into the platinum market, pushing
the metal's value up from $480 an ounce in late September to $620 an
ounce early this month on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   On Wednesday night, Ford Chairman Donald Peterson announced in a
speech in Pittsburgh that Ford was ready to test a catalytic
converter that did not use platinum. On Thursday morning, platinum
prices collapsed.
   Then the facts began to filter in: The Ford device was only
experimental and would be tested only on 40,000 to 50,000 cars in
California; global demand for platinum for catalytic converters
would likely remain strong, at least over the next year or two,
despite the new converter; physical supplies of platinum for
near-term delivery were still very tight.
   And in a rather startling development, Johnson Matthey issued a
statement saying it had collaborated with Ford in the development of
the new converter, and that it had taken the device into account in
preparing its November platinum-market review.
   ``In the short to medium term, we don't believe this development
is going to have any effect on platinum supply-demand fundamentals,
and we feel platinum's long-term supply-demand outlook is not at all
bad,'' said Jack Robson, one of the authors of Johnson Matthey's
November report, in a telephone interview from London.
   Some market analysts were outraged by Johnson Matthey's failure
to disclose its Ford connections in its November supply-demand
report. One called it ``unconscionable.''
   But the market seemed reassured by the refiner's statement.
Platinum's price stabilized Friday at about $520 an ounce on the
cash market.
   ``I would say there still is tremendous physical demand for
platinum and there will be for the foreseeable future,'' said
analyst Levine. ``My view is that $500 platinum too cheap and $600
is probably more reflective of the current supply-demand
fundamentals.''

<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. said Friday it had
extended its $1.1 billion hostile tender offer for rival poultry
processer Holly Farms Corp. for a week to await court rulings
stemming from the battle.
   The $54 a share offer, which was to expire at 5 p.m. EST Friday,
was extended through 5 p.m. EST Dec. 23.
   James B. Blair, an attorney for Tyson, said that by the close of
business Thursday about 1.9 million of Holly Farms' 20 million
outstanding common shares had been tendered under its offer.
   Holly Farms, based in Memphis, Tenn., has rejected two takeover
offers from Tyson and says it will merge with ConAgra, based in
Omaha, Neb., in a $1 billion transaction. Tyson is the nation's
biggest producer of processed chicken and the three companies handle
about 30 percent of the ready-to-cook chicken market.
   Tyson is challenging the Holly Farms-ConAgra merger in court.
   Blair said the share offer had been extended in the hope that the
Delaware Chancery Court would rule next week on Tyson's challenge.
Tyson is seeking a preliminary injunction to block the ConAgra
agreement on grounds it was reached unfairly and was not in
shareholders' best interests.

   Share prices finished higher on the London Stock
Exchange on Friday, fluctuating slightly in daylong quiet trading.
   Dealers attributed the gains to positive sentiment inspired by a
growing belief that British interest rates might not have to rise
further to quell inflationary pressures in the British economy.
   The government reported Friday that Britain's annual inflation
rate held steady at 6.4 percent in November.

10.7 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,773.9.
   Dealers said the market gradually has been shaking off its
previous concerns about the effects of high interest rates on
British corporate profitability.
   Until recently, many analysts thought the government would have
to push base lending rates above the current 13 percent to slow down
the British economy and choke off inflation.
   But recent economic reports, especially average earnings figures
released Thursday and retail sales figures published Monday, have
suggested the economy already is responding to the higher interest
rates.
   Volume was a moderate 468.4 million shares, up from Thursday's
396.2 million shares.

   Grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late rally triggered by
rumors that the Soviet Union had bought large amounts of U.S. corn
and soybean meal.
   Rumors of Soviet buying supported grain and soybean prices all
week despite the lack of official confirmation.
   Large grain companies such as Cargill Inc. and Continental Grain
Co. kicked off the buying Friday and ``suddenly it began to feed on
itself,'' said Pat O'Connell, a grain-market analyst with Refco
Inc., a Chicago-based commodities brokerage house.
   The rally accelerated through a number of buy stops, or levels at
which new buy orders are triggered, he said.
   Corn prices rose high enough to encourage a fair amount of farmer
selling, but the market will have to reach better price levels to
encourage further such selling, O'Connell said.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 7{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.36 a bushel; corn was 2\
cents to 6\ cents higher with December at $2.74{ a bushel; oats were
1} cents to 6 cents higher with December at $2.20 a bushel; soybeans
were 6{ cents to 14} cents higher with January at $7.85 a bushel.

   The stock market headed higher today in activity
swelled by program traders at the quarterly ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.54 to 2,145.54 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 843 up, 558 down and
547 unchanged.
   Some December futures contracts on stock indexes were settled as
of the opening today, while others were to be settled at the close
of trading.
   That prompted extra activity by program traders closing out their
positions. But, as has been the case in several recent witching
hours, it did not produce much in the way of extra volatility in
stock prices.
   Aside from the witching hour, analysts said traders were still
watching warily for signs of the future course of interest rates.
   The Federal Reserve is generally believed to have tightened
credit a notch further this week.
   In the economic news, the government reported that the producer
price of finished goods rose 0.3 percent in November, in line with
advance estimates.
   DuPont climbed 2\ to 86[ on word that the company might sell part
of its Conoco subsidiary next year.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up { at 45{;
International Business Machines, up | at 121|, and American

   Tiger International, which agreed to be acquired by Federal
Express for $20.875 a share, jumped 2{ to 19]. Federal Express
shares dropped { to 46}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.51 to 154.68. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 2.02 at 296.33.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 160.57 million shares with an

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the hottest topics on Wall Street these
days has been speculation over when the Federal Reserve would raise
a key short-term interest rate, known as the discount rate.
   That's the interest the Fed charges on loans to member banks and
savings institutions, and it's considered the most direct vehicle
for the central bank to make its credit policies known. Most
economists predicted the discount rate would be raised 0.5
percentage point to 7 percent.
   The Fed already had given numerous indirect signals of its desire
to keep credit tight.
   This past week alone, it stood by while another important
interest rate, the federal funds rate, headed sharply higher. The
rate on funds, or overnight loans between banks, had gone as high as
9.25 percent on Thursday before closing at 8.87{ percent, up from
8.37{ Wednesday. The rate had been well below 8 percent for most of
the summer.
   Had it wanted to keep interest rates down, or loosen credit, the
Fed would have injected more reserves into the open market through
the purchase of government securities.
   But, ``it failed to counteract the uprward pressures that have
taken place,'' said William V. Sullivan, director of money market
research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``That was a very clear
signal.''
   Over the past few months, the Fed has allowed the fed funds rate
to move higher to keep inflation in check, driving up the yields on
Treasury bills and most other short-term securities. Long-term rates
also have risen, including rates on commercial mortgages and home
equity loans.
   Some economists are predicting the bank prime lending rate, which
was raised a half percentage point to 10.5 percent in late November,
will reach 11 percent by the end of the year.
   Concerns about inflation, coupled with the dollar's recent
weakness in foreign exchange, have been mainly responsible for the
rise in interest rates, economists say.
   Carol A. Stone, a senior economist for Nomura Securities
International Inc., said this past week's government report on
retail sales especially fueled the inflation fears because it showed
brisk economic growth.
   The report said that November retail sales rose 1.1 percent
following an upwardly revised 1.6 percent increase the previous
month.
   ``What we had thought some months ago was that consumer spending
was only sluggish ...,'' Stone said. ``It now looks like consumers
have been spending at a pretty good rate since the summer and that
there's more ... economic activity.''
   Other economic reports released this past week showed that
nationwide industrial production rose a brisk 0.5 percentage points
in November and that factory use climbed 0.2 percentage points to
the highest level in nine years.
   Raising interest rates will amount to throwing cold water on
economic growth because it will make borrowing costs for businesses
and consumers more expensive.

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frederick W. Smith was 27 years old in 1973
when he created Federal Express Corp., a company designed to
speedily fly checks and documents between Federal Reserve banks.
   Since then, Federal Express has grown into the nation's biggest
express package carrier and a dominant force in the overnight
delivery business.
   The Memphis-based company _ known to many Americans by its
offbeat television commercials and fleets of purple-and-white jets
and delivery vans _ reached another milestone Friday when it
announced an agreement to acquire Tiger International Inc. for about
$880 million.
   Tiger is the nation's biggest scheduled cargo transport company
and has substantial foreign routes.
   The buyout will greatly expand Federal's present fleet of 221
aircraft and workforce of 63,000 employees worldwide. Tiger flies 20
Boeing 747s, six DC-8s, and 11 Boeing 727s. It also has two Boeing
747 passenger planes used for military contract flights.
   Federal Express provides international service to more than 100
countries, either through subsidiaries, licensees or by using
independent contractors.
   Although for many people Federal Express' name is synonymous with
overnight delivery, that business actually began in 1929 when United
Parcel Service of America began flying Ford Tri-Motors along the
West Coast.
   But Federal Express did launch modern overnight express services
with its founding in 1973. Adopting elements from the ground system
of companies such as UPS, Federal Express invented an organizational
system used by most overnight companies today, known as ``spoke and
hub.''
   But even Federal didn't take off right away. The government's
cargo regulations limited the company to small planes, and it wasn't
until air cargo deregulation in 1977 that independent haulers were
allowed to fly planes larger than DC-3s.
   In the late 1970s, Federal virtually was alone in the market,
allowing it to establish its delivery and communications systems
without the pressure of competition. Other companies gradually
followed.
   The results have made Federal one of the nation's biggest
transportation-related concerns, with about $3.2 billion in
operating revenue last year. It still trails Greenwich, Conn.-based
United Parcel Service, which had about $9.7 billion in operating
revenue last year.
   Federal Express posted a profit of $118.8 million on sales of
$2.2 billion in the first six months of the current fiscal year. Its
revenue rose to $2.2 billion from $1.85 billion a year earlier.
   In June, Federal Express began package deliveries to Japan,
marking its first venture into the Far East, and recently bought a
100-acre sorting facility in Indianapolis with an eye to making it a
hub in the 1990s. Existing hubs are Memphis and Brussels.
   There have been setbacks. In 1986, the company shut down its
ZapMail electronic document delivery service after two years of
operation and operating losses of $317 million.
   In June, a federal judge in Nashville dismissed a lawsuit in June
by Federal Express challenging the state Public Service Commission's
attempt to regulate its truck delivery of packages between Tennessee
cities.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 17.71 to 2,150.71,
finishing the week with a net gain of 7.22 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
998 up, 476 down and 514 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 196.48 million

a 196.54 million-share day on Oct. 27.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 226.83 million shares.
   Some December futures or options contracts on stock indexes were
settled as of the opening Friday, while others were settled at the
end of trading.
   That prompted extra activity by program traders closing out their
positions, and apparently served as a positive force for the stock
market.
   But, as has been the case in several recent witching hours, it
did not produce much in the way of unusual volatility.
   Aside from the witching hour, analysts said traders were still

   In the economic news, the government reported that the producer

   DuPont made a substantial contribution to the gain in the Dow
Jones industrial average, climbing 2] to 86\ on word that the

   Kollmorgen jumped 5 to 20. On Thursday Vernitron Corp. said made
a $20-a-share bid to acquire Kollmorgen.
   Telerate gained 1[ to 15\. The company said it wasn't aware of
any news to account for the activity.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks picked

<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Friday approved
new capital guidelines designed to push banks into safer investments
or force them to put more of their stockholder's money behind
riskier activities.
   The Fed, by a 6-0 vote, approved the regulations, which reward
institutions for directing their deposits into prudent investments
such as government securities and home mortgages.
   Starting Dec. 31, 1990, banks will have to hold capital _
representing the stockholders' investment in the institution _ of
7.25 percent of loans and other assets. The minimum will increase to
8 percent two years later. The current standard is 6 percent.
   But banks will get a break for certain kind of investments. They
will only have to hold half as much capital for home mortgages,
one-fifth as much capital for mortgage-backed securities sponsored
by government agencies and no capital for U.S. government securities.
   Diane Casey, director of regulatory affairs for the Independent
Bankers Association, a trade group, said the rules may have the
effect of making more mortgage money available.
   ``You will see banks that have ceased making mortgage loans
looking again at mortgage loans because the risk-weighting is such
now that they can afford to make them,'' she said.
   The regulations could also provide a wider market in the United
States for government securities, which have increasingly been sold
to investors in Europe and Japan, she said.
   Board member Wayne Angell objected to the zero risk rating for
government securities, saying, ``There is always some risk.'' He
also said the 20 percent rating for many mortgage-backed securities
``is on the side of inadequate'' and complained, ``I see in front of
me a document that doesn't do much.''
   However, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said the regulations, by
their nature, ``cannot be better than merely satisfactory.''
   Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the regulation was ``an
important first step. ... It may be unsatisfactory relative to some
ideal, but I think it's highly satisfactory to where we were.''
   Beginning with the effective date of the rule _ Feb. 15 _ banks
will have to show that they are working toward meeting the stiffer
requirements by the 1990 and 1992 deadlines.
   An earlier version of the rules was approved by the Federal
Reserve on Aug. 3. Board member Martha Seger, who dissented at the
time, was not present at Friday's meeting.
   Fed staff members said they hoped by the end of 1990 to develop
standards that would adjust banks' capital according to their
vulnerability to changes in interest rates. The standards adopted
Friday apply to the risk of default.
   Other federal banking agencies _ the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, which regulates nationally chartered banks, and the
Federal Deposit Insurance, which oversees federally insured state
chartered banks _ are expected to approve similar capital guidelines
soon. The Fed regulates bank holding companies and banks that belong
to its system.
   The rules bring U.S. regulations into conformance with an
international agreement adopted a year ago in Basel, Switzerland, by
the Fed and the central banks of 11 other major industrialized
countries.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which supervised savings
institutions, is working on risk-based capital rule, but no action
is expected until at least March.

   Federal regulators said Friday they were
providing $118.3 million in assistance to a subsidiary of Ford Motor
Co. to rescue two Michigan savings institutions.
   The two _ First Dearborn and Bloomfield Savings and Loan
Association _ are being acquired by First Nationwide Bank, which is
based in San Francisco but is owned by Ford Motor Co. It has 400
branches in 15 states and $23.6 billion in assets.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which guarantees
S&L deposits up to $100,000, is providing First Nationwide with a
10-year promissory note with a face value of $174 million.
   First Nationwide is paying a premium of $39 million and is
turning over 80 percent of the tax benefits of the deal to the
FSLIC, bank board spokesman Paul Olhkovsky said.
   The two acquired institutions have 28 branches in the Detroit
area. They will open on Monday as branches of First Nationwide.
   The rescue of First Dearborn and Bloomfield bring the total of
thrift rescues and closing for the year to 155, a post-Depression
record. Last year, the cases of 48 failed S&Ls were resolved.
   Critics, including the congressional General Accounting Office,
say the bank board should be given the money to close failed
institutions and should end its strategy of keeping S&Ls alive with
promissory notes.

   The dollar's value rose Friday, strengthened by
intensified speculation about higher U.S. interest rates and
increased yearend demand for the currency by multinational companies.
   Gold prices rose in late U.S. trading after falling abroad, in
markets still jittery following Thursday's selloff in platinum. By 4
p.m. EST, gold fetched $413.50 a troy ounce at Republic National
Bank of New York, up 50 cents from a day earlier.
   Currency strategists said foreign exchange was influenced by
fresh rumors that the Federal Reserve was preparing to raise the
discount rate, which by late Friday remained at 6.5 percent.
   The discount rate is the Fed's interest on loans to U.S.
financial institutions and is a strong influence over other interest
rates. A rise would tend to bolster the value of dollar-denominated
investments.
   Some foreign exchange dealers said the dollar also moved higher
because of orders for the currency by U.S.-based multinationals
preparing to repatriate profits from overseas operations.
   Many companies evidently had been waiting to change currencies
until late in the year, hoping the dollar would fall as it has done
for six out of the past eight years, thereby making a conversion
more attractive.
   ``They figured they'd play that game again to the bitter end, but
this year it doesn't seem to be working,'' said Robert Hatcher, a
senior dealer at the New York branch of Britain's Barclays Bank PLC.
``So they figure they'd bite the bullet and buy dollars now. There's
definitely an underlying demand for dollars here.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.13 Japanese yen to 124.10 yen, and
traded later in London at 124.22 yen. By the time trading ended in
New York the dollar fetched 124.13 yen, up from 123.86 yen late
Thursday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8150 from $1.8280 late
Thursday. In New York, the pound remained unchanged from late
Thursday at $1.8193.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late
Thursday, included: 1.7583 West German marks, up from 1.7557; 1.4820
Swiss francs, up from 1.4783; 1.2034 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2054; 6.0090 French francs, up from 6.0075; and 1,296.50 Italian
lire, unchanged.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.7635 marks, up from 1.7485; 1.4895 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4725; 5.9950 French francs, up from 5.9745; 1.9805
Dutch guilders, up from 1.9665; 1,296.50 Italian lire, up from
1,288.00; and 1.2055 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2054.
   Gold prices steadied in New York as the platinum selloff
subsided, after further depressing gold overseas. The run on
platinum Thursday was blamed on Ford Motor Co.'s announcement of a
platinum-free catalytic converter exhaust system. Catalytic
converters account for about a third of newly mined platinum
consumption.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
rose $1.10 a troy ounce to $414. In London, gold fell $4.20 an ounce
to $412.25; in Zurich it fell $3.75 to $412.25, and in Hong Kong it
fell $7.81 to $415.24 a troy ounce.
   Silver bullion for current delivery rose 2.1 cents a troy ounce
on the New York Comex to $6.082. In London, silver rose 1 cent to
$6.12.

   Two former executives of Anheuser-Busch Inc. and
two advertising executives charged with attempting to defraud the
company and the government were sentenced to prison terms and fined
Friday in federal court.
   The two former executives, Michael A. Orloff and Joseph E.
Martino, each were sentenced to a total of nine years in prison on
counts of mail fraud, conspiracy and filing a false tax return. Both
each were fined $10,000.
   Mark L. Shyres, one of the advertising executives, was sentenced
to a total of 14 years in prison on counts of mail fraud, conspiracy
and two counts of tax evasion. Shyres also was fined $10,000.
   U.S. District Judge William L. Hungate also ordered the three to
make a total of $30,000 in restitution to the brewery.
   Lawyers for all three, who were convicted Oct. 31, said the
planned to appeal.
   Marvin L. Cotlar, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service and cooperated with the government in its
case, was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $10,000.
   The judge stayed execution of the sentences until after the
holidays.
   Orloff, 38, is a former vice president of Anheuser-Busch
wholesale operations. Martino, 36, is a former vice president of
sales. They were fired in March 1987 following a year-long internal
investigation.
   Shyres, 44, was president of the now-defunct Bingham Group, one
of two promotions firms accused of paying Martino and Orloff more
than $52,000 in kickbacks.
   Martino had been on paid leave from his job as vice president of
marketing at Miller Brewing Co., the nation's second-largest maker
of beer. Miller spokesman Al Easton said after the sentences were
announced that Martino had been dismissed.
   The jury found the defendants had agreed that Martino and Orloff
would give Anheuser-Busch sales promotions business to the Bingham
Group in return for a portion of the amount of Bingham invoices that
they approved.
   Cotlar, 50, was president of the Hanley Group, a marketing
company closely affiliated with the Bingham Group.
   Hanley and Bingham paid the kickbacks with cash, gifts, club
memberships, airline tickets and payment of personal bills for
Martino and Orloff, according to court records.
   The jury found Hanley and Bingham recovered some of the costs of
the kickbacks by sending false or padded invoices to Anheuser-Busch.
   Orloff had faced a maximum sentence of 13 years in prison and a
fine of $16,000. Martino faced the same maximum penalty and Shyres
faced a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and fines of up to
$121,000.

<BYLINE>Platinum Futures Plunge Again But Cash Market Steadies
^By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices plunged the permitted limit of $25 an
ounce for the second straight day Friday but cash prices steadied as
players reassessed the likely market impact of Ford Motor Co.'s
platinum-free catalytic converter.
   On other markets, coffee futures roared to a six-month high and
prices of palladium, gold, silver, grain, soybean, energy, cattle,
pork and stock-index futures all rose.
   Platinum for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
settled at $554.50 a troy ounce as traders attempted to bring the
price of the near-month futures contract into line with the spot
price for platinum.
   Spot platinum had tumbled from around $600 to about $532 an ounce
Thursday on news that Ford planned to test an automobile catalytic
converter that did not use the rare and costly metal.
   The use of platinum as a catalyst in the pollution-control
devices accounts for more than one-third of world platinum
consumption.
   Spot platinum settled $7.10 lower Friday on the New York Merc at
$524.80 an ounce after trading as low as $517. But analysts, citing
tight supplies and strong near-term demand for the metal, said the
markets had overreacted to Ford's announcement.
   ``It's going to take some time before the shift to the new
technology takes place at Ford and before other automakers use the
technology and before it gets to Europe,'' said Jack Barbanel,
director of futures trading with Gruntal & Co. in New York.
   ``Meanwhile,'' he said, ``everyone has to accumulate platinum to
put in their converters.''
   Richard Levine, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York,
said he was more bullish on platinum now than when the metal was
trading above $600 earlier this month.
   ``I would consider this a very good buying opportunity,'' he said.
   Ford has not specified which element will replace platinum in its
new converter, but many experts have speculated that it would be
palladium, a metal similar to, but much cheaper than platinum and
which is already used in conjunction with platinum in most
converters.
   Prices of palladium futures, which also are traded on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, soared the daily trading limit of $6 an
ounce Friday with the active March contract settling at $136.25.
   Gold and silver futures gained slightly on New York's Commodity
Exchange after falling sharply in the previous session in sympathy
with platinum.
   Gold was $1 to $1.10 higher with February at $417.60 an ounce;
silver was 2 cents to 2.3 cents higher with March at $6.205 a troy
ounce.
   Coffee futures rocketed to their highest levels since June 10 in
a storm of buying linked to bullish fundamentals, including late
harvests in Central America and Colombia, and a drought and
dockworkers' strike in Brazil.
   Coffee settled 5.64 cents to 8.37 cents higher with March at
$1.4035 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures moved sharply higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade in a late rally triggered by rumors that the Soviet
Union had bought large amounts of U.S. corn and soybean meal,
analysts said.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 7{ cents higher with December at $4.36 a
bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 6 cents higher with December at $2.74\
a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 7{ cents higher with December at
$2.21{ a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 14\ cents higher with
January at $7.86{ a bushel.
   Strong cash markets boosted pork futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while cattle futures finished mostly higher
ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly cattle-on-feed report.
   Live cattle settled .08 cent to .48 cent higher with December at
73.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent higher
with January at 84.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent to .82
cent higher with December at 43.82 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .95 cent to 1.20 cents higher with February at 45.07
cents a pound.
   In energy futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 37 cents
higher with January at $16.72 a barrel; heating oil was .48 cent to
1.08 cents higher with January at 52.02 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .71 cent to 1.51 cents higher with January at 45.13
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced moderately on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 1.15 points higher at 278.85. Each point is
worth $500.

<HEAD>Delaware Judge Invalidates Pillsbury ``Poison Pill''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 9 new grafs with Minnesota ruling, background.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>BY TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge on Friday invalidated
Pillsbury Co.'s ``poison pill'' takeover defense, setting up an
expected appeal by Pillsbury in its attempts to thwart a Grand
Metropolitan PLC's $5.49 billion hostile buyout bid.
   Retired Justice William Duffy of the Court of Chancery in
Wilmington, Del., also issued a preliminary injunction blocking
Pillsbury's plan to spin off its Miami-based Burger King Corp.,
another key element of Pillsbury's takeover defense.
   Earlier Friday, a Minnesota state court judge also temporarily
blocked the spinoff in a separate action requested by dissident
Pillsbury shareholders, but withheld a ruling on the poison pill
pending Duffy's decision.
   However, Hennepin County Dstrict Judge Thomas Carey indicated he
expected to side with the Delaware court's ruling.
   Pillsbury, a food and restaurant company based in Minneapolis and
incorporated in Delaware, had planned the Burger King spinoff in an
attempt to thwart Grand Met, the British real estate, liquor and
gambling conglomerate.
   Duffy ruled on Grand Met's request to invalidate the poison pill
so that it could go ahead with its $63-a-share hostile tender offer.
   The pill is considered Pillsbury's cornerstone defense against a
takeover, but an appeal would at least temporarily block Grand Met
from buying the company.
   Stopping the poison pill was considered critical to Grand Met's
tender offer because the defense would greatly increase the number
of shares Grand Met would have to acquire, making a buyout
prohibitively expensive.
   In the Burger King transaction, Pillsbury planned to spin the
fast food restaurant chain off into a new, publicly traded company
owned by Pillsbury's present shareholders.
   The shareholders also would receive a special dividend payment
and would retaing their stake in Pillsbury.
   In addition to Grand Met, the proposed spinoff has been
criticized by a number of Burger King franchise holders on the
grounds that the huge new debt needed to finance the special
dividend would hinder the operations of the newly independent Burger
King.
   In the Minnesota case, shareholders had filed a class action suit
to compel Pillsbury to negotiate with Grand Met, a British
conglomerate which launched a $60-per-share tender offer on Oct. 4.
   Grand Met sweetened its bid on Monday to $63 a share, or $5.5
billion, but Pillsbury immediately rejected it as inadequate.
   The shareholders said the plan threatened to block Grand Met from
acquiring Pillsbury. Pillsbury has said the spinoff would create a
huge tax liability for Grand Met in the event of a takeover.
   The record date of the spinoff was set for Monday.
   Carey said the temporary enjoinment of the Burger King spinoff
``causes insignificant harm'' to Pillsbury and ``preserves the
status quo.''
   Carey's ruling also denied the shareholders' request to compel
Pillsbury to meet and bargain in good faith with Grand Met.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished little changed in quiet
trading Friday as market watchers said there were indications the
Federal Reserve had tightened credit conditions.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond finished unchanged from late Thursday
while its yield held at 9.05 percent.
   Shorter-term governments posted some slight gains and tax-exempt
issues were higher, but corporate prices slipped.
   Credit-market watchers said evidence was mounting that the
Federal Reserve had decided to tighten credit conditions, possibly
in response to recent indications of rapid economic growth that
could fuel higher inflation.
   Federal Reserve policymakers met in private this week, but
normally don't report or comment on what steps they may have taken
for about six weeks.
   In the absence of a clear statement from the Fed, market watchers
look for other signals that may indicate what it has decided to do.
   Several analysts noted the central bank failed to take
significant steps for the second day in a row to relieve upward
pressure on the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge
each other for short-term overnight loans.
   The federal funds rate was quoted at 8~ percent late Friday,
unchanged from late Thursday. The rate had been fluctuating near 8{
percent in the past few weeks before Thursday.
   William Sullivan Jr., director of money market research for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said the Fed's failure to buy securities and
increase the money available to the banking system indicated the
central bank had tightened.
   He said he expects the Fed soon will raise the discount rate, its
charge on loans to financial institutions, which now is 6{ percent.
   ``I'm surprised they haven't moved on the discount rate
already,'' he said.
   Sullivan also said expects banks to soon boost their prime rate,
which is at 10{ percent and is used as a benchmark for bank interest
on a variety of business and consumer loans.
   Sullivan said the bond market showed little reaction to a new
report that producer prices rose 0.3 percent in November. The rise
was widely expected.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 1-32 point, intermediate issues were up [ point and
20-year issues were steady, the Telerate Inc. financial-information
service said.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, edged up 0.60 to 1,130.38.
   Corporate bond prices slipped. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate
Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds
with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.03 to 292.92.
   In the tax-exempt market, prices rose 5-32 point, according to
the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively-traded municipal issues.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.42 percent as the
discount slipped 2 basis points to 8.15 percent. Yields on six-month
bills held at 8.68 percent as the discount was unchanged at 8.22
percent. Yields on 1-year bills fell to 9.12 percent as the discount
fell 5 basis points to 8.43 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

<HEAD>Federal Express To Buy Flying Tigers' Parent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: moves 10th graf up to 9th graf to improve transition.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Federal Express Corp. agreed Friday to buy the
parent of the Flying Tigers air freight line in an $880 million deal
that would give the overnight-package company a foothold in the
international air cargo business.
   The purchase of Tiger International Inc. would combine Memphis,
Tenn.-based Federal Express, the nation's biggest express package
shipper, with the cargo carrier founded by American pilots who
volunteered to fly for China in the early years of World War II.
   Under an agreement approved by the boards of directors of both
companies, Federal Express will make a $20.87{ a share cash tender
offer Dec. 20 for all Tiger International's 40.8 million common
shares and equivalents.
   When financing costs and the cost of outstanding warrants and
employee options to buy Tiger International stock are included, the
value of the deal is $880 million, said Federal Express spokesman
Armand Schneider.
   Tiger International stock jumped $2.50 to $19.37{ a share on the
New York Stock Exchange. Federal Express dipped 50 cents to $46.75.
   The offer is conditioned on at least 50.1 percent of the Flying
Tigers stock being tendered.
   The merger is subject to the approval of the U.S. Transportation
Department and antitrust clearance from the Justice Department.
Stockholders of both companies must also vote on the buyout.
   Federal Express, which covers the United States with 104 cargo
jets and 137 smaller planes, has had its eye on the international
market for some time, and has established routes to Brussels and
Tokyo. Federal Express carries overnight and second-day letters and
packages of up to 150 pounds.
   The company has 63,000 employees worldwide.
   Flying Tiger, with 37 cargo jets and two passenger airliners, has
scheduled cargo service to North and South America, Asia, Europe,
the South Pacific and the Middle East.
   Frederick Smith, chief executive officer for Federal Express,
said: ``The combination of Flying Tiger's international route
authorities, highly efficient cargo fleet and strategically located
airport facilities will enable Federal Express to accelerate the
development of its global distribution network.''
   Saul Steinberg, Tiger International co-chairman and controller of
14.8 percent of the company through his Reliance Group Holdings
Inc., called the deal a fair one for Tiger shareholders.
   Rumors that Steinberg was interested in selling the company to
maximize his investment have circulated occasionally for more than a
year and a half.
   In Tiger International, Federal Express gets a company with a
colorful history that only recently clawed its way back from the
brink of liquidation.
   Flying Tiger was founded in 1945 by pilots who fought with Maj.
Gen. Claire Chennault's fighter group of the same name. The Flying
Tigers, who went to China in 1941 to fly missions against the
Japanese, later became part of the U.S. Army Air Force.
   The fliers' civilian enterprise was the world's first scheduled
air cargo line, and claims to be the biggest. It has about 6,500
employees.
   But Tiger almost was forced into liquidation in 1986 after a run
of losses blamed on ill-fated diversification moves, high salaries
and high fuel prices.
   A last-minute agreement by workers to take pay cuts and make
work-rule concessions averted sale of the fleet, and the company
moved back into the black last year, paying employees $16 million in
profit-sharing that was part of the recovery deal.
   A decision has yet to be made on whether Tiger will retain its
identity, the companies said.
   Federal Express has ridden a boom in overnight mail for some
years, but acknowledges that the proliferation of facsimile machines
_ which deliver photocopies instantly by telephone _ has slowed the
growth of its business.
   It has been rumored for some time to be interested in getting
into the cargo business.
   Federal Express posted a profit of $118.8 million on sales of
$2.2 billion in the first six months of the current fiscal year.
   Federal Express flies 80 Boeing 727s, 24 McDonnell Douglas DC-10s
and 137 smaller Cessna and Fokker turboprop planes.
   Tiger earned $32.8 million on sales of $639.8 million in the
first six months.
   Tiger flies 20 Boeing 747s, six DC-8s, and 11 Boeing 727s. It
also has two Boeing 747 passenger planes used for military contract
flights. 6,500.

<HEAD>Inflation Up Moderately; Housing Starts Hit Seven-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation at the wholesale level maintained its moderate pace
during November while housing construction soared to its highest
point in seven months, the government said.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that wholesale prices rose
0.3 percent in November as food costs showed no increases for the
second straight month. The stable food prices helped offset large
increases for gasoline and heating oil.
   The report helped to weaken theories that inflation is worsening.
The November increase, if it persisted for 12 months, would amount
to an annual inflation rate of just 3.3 percent, lower than the 3.8
percent annualized rate for the first 11 months of 1987.
   ``Inflationary fears exceed inflationary reality at the present
time,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at
Georgia State University in Atlanta.
   In another report Friday, the Commerce Department said new homes
and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.56 million units last month, up from the 1.54 million rate in
October.
   It was the third increase in a row and the highest level of
construction activity since April. Housing starts soared 5.1 percent
in October and rose 0.4 percent in September.
   Housing permits, a good barometer of future housing activity,
edged up 0.1 percent to a ratould have cost $109.70 last month, 40
cents more than in October.

   Energy futures have ended a week of volatile
trading with sharply higher prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
unleaded gasoline settled at 45.13 cents a gallon Friday, up 1.48
cents from the close Thursday, when it lost 0.07 cent. Other
contract months also showed big gains.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange
Friday, wholesale home heating oil jumped 1.08 cents to 52.02 cents
a gallon, after falling 0.19 cent Thursday.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $16.72 a barrel, up 37 cents
from Thursday. It fell 2 cents in the previous session.
   Analysts attributed Friday's increase largely to optimism that
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would stick to its
production-cutting pact reached last month in Vienna. The 13-nation
cartel agreed to keep daily output levels at 18.5 million barrels to
push up sagging worldwide oil prices.
   Marketwide optimism about OPEC brought oil prices sharply higher
throughout the week, but subsequent profit-taking pushed down those
gains.
   Although the OPEC pact doesn't go into effect until Jan. 1, there
are reports that some OPEC members already have started to slash
output, said Robert Murphy, a vice president at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   He said the heating oil market was helped by the continued cold
weather in the Northeast.

<TEXT>
   The government has widened a securities-fraud
probe into dealings by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., evidently
unsatisfied with results of the investigation so far and impatient
over the securities firm's refusal to settle by admitting guilt and
paying large penalties, sources said.
   ``There's no question the investigation has shifted into other
areas,'' said one of the sources, who were familiar with the Drexel
probe but spoke on condition they not be identified. ``They've
probably come to the realization they don't have enough.''
   The investigation, once limited to allegations of a conspiracy
between Drexel and now-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky, has been
frustrated by a lack of substantive evidence and is spreading into
possibly questionable dealings between the firm and other
individuals, these sources said Friday.
   Evidence for the broadened probe is coming from three Drexel
high-yield bond traders, James Dahl, Cary Maultasch and Terren
Peizer, who are known to be cooperating with the government in
exchange for lenient treatment.
   These developments suggested the negotiations between Drexel and
the Manhattan U.S. attorney, which have been going on for the past
several weeks, remain substantially unresolved, despite predictions
that a break in one of the biggest securities fraud cases in history
could come before Christmas.
   Bruce Baird, the assistant Manhattan U.S. attorney for securities
fraud, declined to comment on the Drexel case. Drexel spokesman
Steven Anreder also declined to comment.
   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has been negotiating
intensely with the U.S. attorney's office to avoid a potentially
ruinous indictment on fraud and racketeering charges, the result of
the investigation rooted in the Boesky insider trading scandal.
   As the negotiations have dragged on, unconfirmed reports,
conflicting speculation and leaks of imminent settlements and sudden
snags have persisted.
   Earlier in the week rumors flew that the firm's high-yield bond
executive Michael Milken, another key target in the probe, had
resigned abruptly. The rumor was officially denied.
   Some sources disputed another report Friday that suggested a rift
was growing in Drexel's senior management over terms of a
settlement, which could include hundreds of millions of dollars in
fines, multiple guilty pleas and restraints on some of the firm's
most profitable operations.
   A settlement also would almost certainly include the ouster of
Milken, who regardless of what happens to Drexel is expected to be
indicted.
   The Wall Street Journal said key Drexel executives Leon Black and
Peter Ackerman were threatening to resign if a proposed agreement
required the firm to cooperate with the government in prosecuting
Milken, the driving force behind the firm's prowess in the $175
billion high-yield ``junk bond'' market.
   ``They didn't threaten to quit,'' said one source in response to
the Journal account. ``No such threat was made. They're still
aboard.''
   Others with knowledge of the situation said some Drexel
executives were growing exasperated with the government's tough
negotiating position and were increasingly opposed to a settlement,
preferring to scrap it out in court.
   ``Some people are saying, what the government's asking is
unconscionable,'' said one source. ``If the government has its way,
it's selling Milken out. It's not fair and it's not right.''
   Drexel and Milken have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the
protracted legal ordeal, which began after Boesky turned state's
evidence and paid the Securities and Exchange Commission a record
$100 million fine for insider trading two years ago.
