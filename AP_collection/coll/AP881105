   A treaty banning genocide finally has the force
of U.S. law, bringing to a close 40 years of opposition by
conservatives and putting a final feather in the political cap of
retiring Sen. William Proxmire.
   President Reagan signed legislation Friday to implement the
treaty, which was ratified by the Senate on Feb. 11, 1986. By the
time the Senate acted, 95 other nations had ratified the treaty. The
implementing legislation was passed last month.
   Proxmire had delivered more than 3,000 speeches over 19 years
before the ratification vote. Conservatives fought it all the way.
They contended the treaty undermined rights of Americans under the
Constitution and infringed on U.S. sovereignty.
   The legislation signed by Reagan implements the treaty by making
genocide _ the deliberate destruction of a specific population _
punishable under U.S. law and setting stern penalties for violators.
   The Senate version of the genocide implementation bill is
officially called ``The Proxmire Act'' to honor the long crusade of
the Wisconsin Democrat who is closing out a 31-year Senate career.
   Speaking Friday in Eau Claire, Wis.. Proxmire said he was not
given enough advance notice to attend the bill signing ceremony.
   ``I was sorry I could not be there, but the important thing is
that it was signed,'' Proxmire said. ``It should have been done long
ago.''
   The treaty was drafted after World War II as a response to the
Nazi Holocaust that killed millions of Europe's Jews and other
ethnic minorities. It was approved by the United Nations at the end
of 1948 and submitted to the Senate early the next year by President
Truman.
   The Soviet Union frequently embarrassed American diplomats by
claiming that the U.S. failure to ratify the pact was evidence the
United States lacked a complete commitment to human rights.
   Reagan signed the genocide bill at a ceremony at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport, saying he was ``delighted to fulfill the
promise made by Harry Truman to all the peoples of the world _ and
especially the Jewish people.''
   The president recalled the Nazi death camps that claimed millions
of Jews, Slavs, Gypsies and others and said similar atrocities have
since taken place in Cambodia, the Ukraine and Ethiopia.
   These events ``only renew our rage and righteous fury and make
this moment all the more significant for me and all Americans,''
Reagan said.
   Addressing the Senate on Oct. 14, shortly before the genocide
bill was passed, Proxmire said the treaty was made necessary ``by
the deliberate murder of 6 million Jews.''
   ``They were gassed, lined up and shot and they were worked to
death,'' he said. ``Why? Only because they worshipped God in a
different way.''
   Proxmire drew praise from his colleagues for his ``long and often
lonely'' fight and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., told the
Senate: ``I have no single doubt in my mind that there would be no
treaty without Senator Proxmire.''
   ``The senator from Wisconsin never stopped talking; his was a
kind of moral filibuster,'' said Seymour D. Reich, international
president of B'Nai B'rith, at a reception honoring Proxmire a few
days later.
   The Proxmire Act defines genocide as an action taken with a
``specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a
national, ethnic, racial or religious group.''
   It would apply to activities in which members of those groups
were killed, seriously injured or permanently impaired through the
use of drugs, torture or ``similar techniques'' or were subjected to
conditions aimed at causing ``the physical destruction of the
group.''
   Also included are efforts to prevent births within a group or
forcefully removing children.
   If death results, people found responsible could be fined up to
$1 million and imprisoned for life. Where no death is involved, the
punishment is set at a fine of up to $1 million and 20 ears in
prison.
   Under the law, anyone convicted of inciting another to violate
its terms could be fined up to $500,000 and imprisoned for up to
five years.
   Legalistic and conservative objections to Senate ratification of
the genocide treaty were raised from the beginning.
   Dr. William Korey, director for international policy research for
B'nai B'rith International, wrote in a recent account about the
struggle to ratify the pact that part of the problem arose over the
treaty's attempt to outlaw genocide ``in whole or in part.''
   ``Fears were apparent in various segregationist circles that the
reference to ``in part'' might be applied to a limited form of race
violence, such as lynchings,'' Korey said. ``The phrase `mental
harm' also raised concerns.''
   Other critics said the United States might be embarrassed by an
international show trial based on alleged atrocities against
American Indians in the 19th century.
   Still others expressed fear that ratification could result in
American citizens being tried against their will by an international
tribunal, without the protections accorded by the U.S. Constitution.
   These fears were dealt with in 1986 when the Senate adopted
reservations asserting the right of U.S. citizens to contitutional
protections and giving the United States the right to exempt itself
from compulsory jurisdiction in genocide cases before the World
Court.

   A Pentagon audit says vague guidelines are to
blame for millions of dollars in questionable payments to major
defense contractors for work performed by outside consultants.
   Defense Contract Audit Agency, in a review of 12 of the top 100
defense contractors, questioned the validity of claims for $43
million out of the $236.5 million charged to the government over the
past year for consultants.
   A separate audit, by the Pentagon Inspector General's office,
estimated that an Air Force logistics center in Georgia paid an
estimated $104 million for spare parts that did not meet contract
specifications, amounting to 89 percent of its inventory.
   The review of consultants' fees by the Defense Contract agency
involved 12 major contractors: Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp.,
Hughes Aircraft Co., IBM Inc., Litton Industries Inc., Lockheed
Corp., Martin Marietta Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp., Northrop
Corp., Raytheon Co., UNISYS Corp., and United Technologies Corp.
   The audit, released Friday, found that the internal business
discipline one would expect at a large company for hiring outsiders
is, ``in most cases, non-existent.''
   If anything, the total for questionable claims is
``understated,'' the audit added.
   Often, contractors simply could not explain what work their
consultants had performed, the auditors wrote. And in some cases, it
appears the consultants performed lobbying or publicity work that
should not have been reimbursed.
   The DCAA audit, spawned by a massive fraud investigation at the
Pentagon, depicts a clubby atmosphere in which major contractors
rarely ask that consultant contracts be put in writing and
frequently hire consultants without soliciting competitive bids.
   The Pentagon, in releasing the audit, announced it already had
written new regulations to address the DCAA's concerns.
   The audit was ordered last July after disclosures that federal
prosecutors were conducting a wide-ranging fraud investigation
focusing on contractors and their outside consultants along with
selected Pentagon employees.
   The separate audit on the procurement of spare parts by the Air
Force concluded that the service ``did not receive the quality parts
it paid for.''
   A spokesman for Air Force Logistics Command at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, took sharp issue with the draft
Inspector General's report, which was obtained and distributed by
the Project on Military Procurement, a private watchdog group in
Washington.
   ``The figure is very misleading,'' said Air Force spokesman Ken
Perrotte. ``They tested a sample and made projections,'' he said,
challenging both the methods and the calculations used by the
Inspector General's office.
   To make their estimate, auditors from the inspector general's
office visited the Warner Robbins Air Logistics Center, 18 miles
south of Macon, Ga., and checked samples of inventory items ranging
from a bolt costing $6.95 to more complicated hardware costing
thousands of dollars per item.
   The total value of the items checked was $114.4 million, of which
$48.4 million worth were found to have major ``nonconformances''
which made them unfit for service and $55 million had less serious
problems, known as minor nonconformances.
   The auditors checked 1,027 samples of 46 different items, and
projected their results against a total of 685,925 spare parts
calculated to have been at the center. Those projections showed that
89 percent of the spares did not meet contract specifications.

   The Energy Department's estimate of the cost of
building a superconducting super collider could be nearly 50 percent
too low, a government study says.
   The Congressional Budget Office study said the price tag could be
$6.4 billion if costs follow the pattern for atom smashers already
built. It offered a second estimate, which it said was based on more
conservative assumptions, of $5.1 billion.
   The Energy Department has put the project's cost at $4.4 billion,
a figure it said was accurate within 10 percent given that final
design studies will not be done until a site is chosen.
   The collider would be a 53-mile, underground ring of magnets
capable of whipping proton beams together with 20 times the force of
the most powerful existing accelerator, the Tevatron at the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill.
   Scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from
studying the subatomic particles created by the proton collisions.
   The study released this week by the Congressional Budget Office
said the Energy Department may have underestimated the price of
collider components such as proton-collision detectors and
overestimated savings expected from advances in the manufacture of
superconducting magnets.
   Superconductors transmit electricity without resistance.
   Congress has appropriated $205 million for the collider,
including $100 million for research and development in the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1, but has not authorized its construction.
   Illinois, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee
and Texas were chosen as finalists from among 25 states bidding for
the collider, which will provide its host with thousands of
construction jobs and permanent work for as many as 3,000 people.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington is expected to announce a
tentative site selection this month and confirm the choice by
January 1989.

<TEXT>
   A decorated former Air Force colonel who
inadvertently shot a 30mm anti-tank shell into a service station
gasoline pump has escaped criminal charges.
   Arlington County General District Judge Paul Sheridan on Friday
dismissed a misdemeanor charge against Robert Dilger, saying, ``I'm
convinced that you have suffered enough.''
   The judge noted that Dilger scraped together $50,000 to help
compensate the people injured by flying shrapnel in the August 1986
explosion.
   Dilger had pleaded no contest a little over a year ago to the
misdemeanor charge of discharging a firearm in a public place.
Sheridan had postponed sentencing in order to give Dilger a chance
to try to compensate the people hurt in the explosion.
   Three of the four people injured sued Dilger and the federal
government. Attorneys for the injured said the government was partly
at fault for supplying Dilger with ammunition.
   The Army never admitted liability, but one of Dilger's attorneys
said the government had agreed to pay 80 percent of the settlement
to the victims. That agreement was reached about two weeks ago.
   ``It seems to me that the injured people have been satisfied,''
Sheridan said.
   The local prosecutor did not object to the dismissal of the
charge.
   Dilger, who was trying to market the 30mm anti-tank cannon to the
Pentagon at the time of the accident, refused comment after the
hearing.
   Dilger told authorities he had been filling his pickup truck with
gasoline when he noticed his companion, Raymond Donohue, was
examining the cannon. When he tried to show Donohue how the weapon
worked, ``it went off. Nobody could have been more surprised than
myself.''
   Following the explosion, Dilger said, he picked up one victim and
pulled her away from the burning pumps, then moved the truck and
another vehicle away from the pumps.
   Dilger and Donohue drove away from the scene, but had second
thoughts and said they had started circling back toward the station
when stopped by police.
   Sheridan said he considered criminal penalties because Dilger _
winner of three Silver Stars and four Distinguished Flying Crosses
in Vietnam _ left the scene of the accident.
   ``The only upsetting part of this was the walking away,'' the
judge said. ``That is the only reason I would have denied the
(dismissal) request.''
   Theresa Thompson, a former gas station employee, had sought $2.4
million in damages. Elda and Domenico Gargani of Arlington, who were
sitting in a nearby car when the pump exploded, sought $1 million
each. All three were injured by metal fragments from the explosion.

<HEAD>FDA Says Three Patients Dead From Vitamin B1 Deficiency; Warns
Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three people receiving intravenous feedings
have died from a vitamin B1 deficiency, the Food and Drug
Administration announced as it urged doctors to be sure patients
being fed by needle are getting the essential nutrient.
   Identities of the patients were not released, but the FDA said
Friday the deaths were indirectly due to a national shortage of a
multivitamin preparation usually added to the liquid given patients
receiving intravenous feedings.
   The shortage occurred after a Chicago manufacturer of the
multivitamin supplement, Lyphomed Inc., had to cut production after
the FDA ordered a recall in July of some of the company's product.
   Bill Grigg, an FDA spokesman, said that as a result of the
shortage, the federal agency was concerned that patients receiving
the IV feedings would not receive vitamin B1, or thiamine, which is
essential to the body.
   ``Potentially fatal thiamine deficiencies could result because
thiamine is consumed at a high rate in patients receiving
intravenous feedings of glucose sugar,'' said the FDA announcement.
   The announcement came after the American Society for Parentral
and Enternal Nutrition, an organization of experts in IV feedings,
warned its 5,000 members that three patients receiving IV feedings
have died as a result of thiamine deficiency. Marsha Regenstein, a
spokeswoman at ASPEN, confirmed the deaths, but said the
organization's legal counsel had advised against identifying the
patients.
   Grigg said he had no further details on the deaths.
   Intravenous, or IV, feedings are used for patients who are unable
to take food by mouth. This would include those who are unconscious
or who do not have an intact digestive system due to surgery, injury
or disease.
   Janet Gannon, a dietician for ASPEN, said those most at risk are
patients receiving what is called parentral feedings.
   She said such patients receive liquid feedings of 70 percent
glucose through a needle that leads directly into the aorta. A
shortage of thiamine in such patients can develop in as little as a
week because the vitamin is essential for metabolizing the glucose.
About 10,000 to 15,000 patients in the nation are on parentral
feeding, she said.
   Vitamin B1 is essential for functioning of the cardiovascular and
nervous system, and for metabolism. A deficiency results in a
disease called beriberi. Severe cases can lead to heart failure and
death. Thiamine easily can be added to the routine IV feedings, Ms.
Gannon said.
   Melissa Marsden, a spokeswoman at Lyphomed, the company chose to
close its Orlando, Fla. plant for a time after FDA inspectors found
a problem that involved keeping products sterile. She said the
problem has been corrected and Lyphomed is now back into full
production.
   Grigg said it is expected that the shortage of the vitamin
supplement will be corrected soon.

<HEAD>President Signs Into Law Bill Raising AIDS Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed into law
legislation boosting spending on AIDS testing, research and
education by up to $870 million a year.
   The compromise measure, stripped of controversial elements that
had tied it up for months, was approved by the House and Senate in
separate voice votes on Oct. 13.
   White House officials traveling with Reagan on Friday announced
in Voorhees Township, N.J., that the president had signed the
measure.
   Fearful that no legislation expanding spending on AIDS programs
would be passed because of opposition from conservatives _
particuarly Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. _ the measure's chief backers
agreed to bring it up as part of an overall health package that
skirted the controversial matters of confidentiality for AIDS test
results and antidiscrimination protection for those found to carry
the virus.
   As finally approved, the measure authorizes $100 million a year
for AIDS testing over the next two years and an additional $100
million in each of the next two years for home health care of people
with AIDS.
   It also includes up to $300 million in new research funds in each
of the next three years and $370 million additional for AIDS
education.
   Although disappointed they were not able to push through
provisions guaranteeing confidentiality and antidiscrimination
protection, AIDS activists in and out of Congress said a bill that
essentially just expanded spending without breaking new policy
ground was better than no bill at all.
   The main authors, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., and Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., have vowed to continue their quest for
confidentiality and antidiscrimination protection when the new
Congress convenes in January.
   Whatever the outcome of the presidential election next Tuesday,
backers of such provisions are encouraged they will have more
support from the White House.
   Both Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis have
said they support the White House AIDS commission's call last summer
for federal antidiscrimination legislation as the single most
important tool in fighting the disease.
   Reagan has made no such declaration, referring the matter to the
Justice Department for study.
   Bush's top health adviser told reporters this week that the vice
president, if elected, would push for antidiscrimination legislation.
   Health professionals maintain that the best way to curb the
spread of the virus, which federal officials estimate has already
infected up to 1.5 million U.S. residents, is to do everything
possible to encourage people to come forward for testing and
counseling.
   And the best way to do that, they argue, is to insure that people
who carry the virus will not be punished by arbitrarily losing their
jobs, homes and health insurance.
   The chief victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have
been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, although a small
percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated
blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women
to their offspring.
   As of Monday, AIDS had been diagnsed in 76,932 Americans, of whom
more than half, or 43,177, have died since June 1, 1981, according
to the federal Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to have
recovered from AIDS.

   Emperor Hirohito's temperature fell today after
doctors gave him antibiotics to alleviate intestinal inflammation
brought about by a slight discharge of blood, a palace spokesman
said.
   Court doctors said antibiotics were administered Friday for the
first time since mid-October to alleviate the inflammation of
Hirohito's upper intestinal area.
   The world's longest-reigning living monarch, 87, has been
bedridden since Sept. 19 when he vomited blood because of internal
hemorrhaging. He has continued to bleed intermittently, including
Friday night, mostly in the upper intestinal area where he underwent
a bypass operation last year.
   Hirohito has received 34.2 pints of blood to combat anemia and
internal bleeding since his health worsened.
   Meanwhile, Kyoto Gosho, a palace in western Japan where the
imperial family lived until 1868, will open to the public for five
days starting today for a biannual festival. But some attractions,
including music and dancing, were called off in deference to
Hirohito's illness, palace officials said.

<HEAD>Bentsen Returns To California In Search of `Big Prize'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen is in California for a final day
of campaigning there in hopes of putting Michael Dukakis over the
top in that most important state.
   ``This is the big prize. Forty-seven electoral votes,'' he said
on arrival Friday night at the Burbank airport.
   ``We win this one, we win it all,'' he said.
   Bentsen claimed the latest polls showed the Republican lead
collapsing and insisted the Democrats still had time to catch them
by election day. Bentsen planned to attend a get-out-the-vote rally
this morning in East Los Angeles.
   ``The Republicans are dropping like a rock in those polls,'' he
told the cheering crowd of several hundred at the airport rally.
   Bentsen was in Texas and New Mexico earlier in the day. In
Houston, Bentsen worked to highlight the Democratic ticket's
commitment to the space program, which has a major presence in Texas
industry and with the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   The Texas senator toured the Challenger Center at the Houston
Museum of Natural Science. The center was founded as part of an
effort, in the wake of the 1986 Challenger space shuttle tragedy, to
boost interest in science and technology among the young.
   Bentsen looked at a mock space station to watch fourth graders
operate various devices, and he took an electronic stress test. A
girl held wires to Bentsen's finger and measured only 1.6 on a scale
in which 5 is considered normal.
   ``That means I'm cool,'' the senator quipped.
   Bentsen also met with a student audience in the museum
auditorium, and made an unusual miscue.
   The man Michael Dukakis has said would head up his cabinet
council on space asserted that the next space shuttle launched, the
Atlantis, would be unmanned. In fact, the ship will have a crew of
five for its secret military mission later this month.
   Aides attributed the mistake to an incorrect briefing paper.
   On his way to California, Bentsen stopped in Las Cruces, N.M.,
for a rally at that airport with about 500 supporters, hosted by
Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.
   Bentsen said he wanted to ``set 'em straight'' on issues the
Republicans have distorted, such as gun control and defense. The Las
Cruces area is near the White Sands testing area, and government
research dollars are important to the area economy.
   Bentsen told the crowd a Democratic administration would spend $1
billion a year on research on Star Wars. The Democrats currently
oppose deployment of a space-based missile defense system.

   Mary Elizabeth Whitney Tippett, a horsebreeder
for more than 50 years, died of cancer at her Llangollen Farm near
Upperville, Va. She was 82.
   Mrs. Tippett had raised horses in Virginia, Florida, California,
New York and Ireland since her 1930 marriage to John Hay Whitney. He
later became U.S. ambassador to Britain and was a publisher of the
New York Herald Tribune.
   Mrs. Tippett died Oct. 30.
   An accomplished horsewoman, she received Llangollen Farm, a
3,300-acre estate, from Whitney as a wedding gift. When the couple
divorced in 1940, Mrs. Tippett established the farm as a major
racing stables in the United States. As early as 1933, her
2-year-old colt Singing Wood won the Belmont Futurity.
   By the late 1950s, Mrs. Tippett had one of the largest
privately-owned horse breeding businesses in North America.

   The complete works of filmmaker
Milos Forman, Oscar-winning director of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest'' and ``Amadeus,'' are being bought for distribution in
Czechoslovakia 20 years after he left his native land.
   A report in Friday's Communist Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo
announced the purchase, confirming rumors in Prague that Forman
movies such as ``Hair'' finally will be seen in the country where he
spent his first 36 years.
   ``It is great that they will show his films at last, I just don't
know why they couldn't do so before,'' actress Vera Kresadlova,
Forman's first wife and mother of his twin sons, told The Associated
Press by phone. ``I guess they finally realized that if Milos
`walks' the streets of Prague again, it doesn't have to cause a
riot.''
   A Prague film critic who asked to remain anonymous welcomed the
news and opined it indicated that ``those friends and colleagues of
his (Forman's) who managed to keep the lid on his work for a long
time are finally retiring.''
   Forman's first films were made in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s,
including ``Fireman's Ball,'' which is enjoying another run in
Prague right now, according to Rude Pravo.
   Forman moved to the United States in 1968, when Warsaw Pact tanks
ended the ``Prague Spring'' reforms, and started his second career
with ``Taking Off'' in 1971.
   But it was ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' that brought him
worldwide fame, winning five Oscars and becoming a symbol of
artistic skill for Czechoslovaks who were not able to see the film
officially.
   In 1977, Forman was given American citizenship and went on to
make ``Hair'' and ``Ragtime.''Neither was purchased by
Czechoslovakia's state-run film distribution firms.
   With the spread of video in the 1980s, bootleg copies spread on
the black market in Czechoslovakia.
   Forman returned to Czechoslovakia in 1983 to shoot ``Amadeus'' in
Prague.
   The film was shown in 1986 as Czechoslovakia's most other famous
exile in the United States, tennis star Martina Navratilova,
returned to her native land to play in the Federation Cup tournament.
   In 1987, Forman went to Moscow's international film festival as
signs emerged that the Soviet drive for more openness in the arts
was breaking down some previous tabus in Czechoslovakia's state-run
arts.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis has lost his lead
over Republican George Bush among likely Minnesota voters for the
first time in their presidential race, according to a poll released
Saturday.
   The Northstar Poll found Bush with a 48 percent to 45 percent
lead among likely Minnesota voters, the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch reported in its Saturday editions. The poll is conducted by
the Pioneer Press Dispatch, WCCO_TV and WCCO-Radio in the Twin
Cities.
   Since the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus four
percentage points, the race amounts to a dead heat in the state.
   The survey of 646 likely voters was conducted from Monday through
Thursday, a time of heightened publicity about Dukakis. The
Massachusetts governor was in the Twin Cities Tuesday night and
Wednesday morning to visit his wife, Kitty, who was being treated at
the University of Minnesota Hospital for a viral infection.
   Dukakis once had a double-digit lead in Minnesota.

   The French vote Sunday on a referendum the
government hopes will bring peace to the Pacific territory of New
Caledonia following a campaign that has generated little enthusiasm
and confusion about what they're voting on.
   Polls leading up to the vote indicate only 38 percent of the
eligible voters will cast ballots. Of those who said they would go
to the polls, 84 percent said they would approve the plan.
   Periodic violence has broken out in the territory since November
1984 between native Melanesians, known locally as Kanaks, and white
settlers, called Caldoches. Nearly 40 people have been killed.
   On April 22, Melanesians attacked a police station on the island
of Ouvea, killing four policemen and taking 27 others hostage. On
May 5, an assault on a cave where the kidnappers held the hostages
killed two more policemen and 19 Kanaks.
   The latest attacks sobered Caledonians, native and European, and
caused them to rethink their attitudes.
   The plan to be voted on Sunday has attracted great support in
mainland France. Governing Socialists, Communists, and center-right
Union for French Democracy all are backing a ``yes'' vote on Sunday.
   Premier Michel Rocard has taken a front-line role in the campaign.
   ``I don't want there to be any more violence and deaths in New
Caledonia,'' the premier said. ``I say no to civil war, and the only
means of preventing this danger is the `yes' in the referendum,'' he
said.
   The conservative Rally for the Republic is campaigning for
absention. It says it cannot disavow its local arm, which agreed to
the plan, but also cannot vote for it because of constitutional
objections.
   France's Socialist government is asking voters Sunday to approve
measures set out in 96 articles of a long draft law that few people
have read and, because of its legalistic language, even fewer have
understood.
   Some people interviewed by newspapers and television seem to
think they are voting directly on independence for New Caledonia.
Others are not sure exactly what they are voting for, though some
say they will vote anyway.
   The essential provision is for a local referendum in 10 years to
decide if the territory becomes independent or remains French.
   Meanwhile, the new law would divide New Caledonia into three
provinces, each with its own local assembly, and an elected
territorial congress with no pre-determined ethnic breakdown. The
territory would be ruled directly from Paris until next summer, when
the new bodies and local administration would take over.
   The population of the archipelago, controlled by France since
1853, is 145,000.
   Forty-three percent are native Melanesians mostly favoring
independence. But they are in the minority because most Polynesians
and Asians support the European community of 37 percent that
generally wants to remain French.
   The plan to be put before French voters Sunday came out of June
discussions between Jean-Marie Tjibaou, leader of the Kanak
Socialist National Liberation Front, and Jacques Lafleur, head of
anti-independence Rally for Caledonia in the Republic. They met in
Paris with Rocard, and the resulting plan was lauded as one of the
successes of Rocard's new government.
   A referendum on independence was held in the territory Sept. 13,
1987, when local voters supported remaining French by 98.3 percent
to 1.7 percent. But the main Melanesian group had called for a
boycott, keeping turnout to 59 percent.
   All eligible French voters, including those in New Caledonia and
other overseas territories, may vote Sunday.

   Keeping the public informed about the illness of
Emperor Hirohito has proved to be a marathon job for an overworked
palace staff and weary press corps.
   Hundreds of journalists stake out the Imperial Household Agency
and the seven gates to the moated palace in hopes of snaring
visitors who have just seen Hirohito, or of gleaning a clue to his
health from seeing who is entering the palace _ the chief doctors,
or a blood-delivery car.
   Dozens of Japanese reporters and cameramen fill the vaulted halls
of the palace agency, rolled up in blankets on the floor, slumped
over lawn chairs or vacantly reading comic books. Others scribble
away elbow to elbow at tiny desks in the press room.
   Some go home so rarely that the media have virtually taken over
nearby hotels.
   ``We've had a couple of reporters hospitalized out of sheer
fatigue,'' said a reporter for Tokyo Broadcasting System, a major
private TV network.
   News reports have consisted almost entirely of detailed updates
on Hirohito's pulse, temperature, blood pressure, respiration, blood
transfusions and vague palace comments that the monarch is
``resting.''
   The 87-year-old Hirohito began suffering from internal bleeding
Sept. 19 and since has been given many blood transfusions.
   The sole official source for such news is Kenji Maeda, who until
July was police chief in northern Aomori prefecture.
   Maeda, 49, is head of the Imperial Household Agency General
Affairs Division, which means he is in charge of security as well as
palace spokesman. When he took the job, he hastily studied up on
imperial history and traditions, but concedes there is no time for
that now.
   The 20-year police veteran still is getting used to the
intricacies of the imperial household and the specialized language
used to talk to and about family members.
   ``I admit it all makes me nervous,'' he says carefully, his eyes
fluttering from lack of sleep. ``It's been true on-the-job
training.''
   Maeda, works 12 to 13 hours daily, seven days a week, then faces
more telephone calls and reporters when he gets home.
   The palace press club is a tightly knit grouping of nine big
newspapers and six TV networks. Following a Japanese media tradition
that gives them exclusive coverage rights, other Japanese media and
foreign reporters are barred from membership.
   ``We understand the media's deep interest,'' said Maeda. ``But
they want everything. We just tell them what we feel is necessary.''
   His office view of black pine, camphor and sweet acorn trees is
marred by a parking lot jammed with media vans bristling with
antennae and microwave dishes.
   Six black telephones sit beside Maeda's desk, linked with other
extensions in the agency, the Fukiage palace where Hirohito is
bedridden and the National Police Agency. A portrait of the imperial
family hangs on a wall next to a huge photograph of the emperor
hosting a banquet for President Reagan.
   Once viewed as a living god, the emperor still is seen by many as
a hallowed symbol of state. According to Imperial Household Agency
rules, he may be seen but not heard on television, except in rare
appearances before the public, and palace officials refuse to
describe his private conversations.
   Maeda, like any Japanese bureaucrat, refuses to talk about what
happens once Hirohito dies, dismissing such questions as
``hypothetical.''
   For the media, it has been an enormous expense. Kyodo News
Service estimates it spends $160,000 a day on emperor coverage,
while TV networks face daily bills of $240,000.
   But the reporting has been a windfall for some. One Kyodo
correspondent said he earned $4,000 in overtime during the first
month of Hirohito's illness.

   The old-favorite pairing of ``Cavalleria
Rusticana'' and ``Pagliacci'' returned to the Metropolitan Opera
Friday night after three years away.
   Both had their thrilling moments as well as moments that weren't.
Ghena Dimitrova, singing her first Santuzza in ``Cav'' at the Met,
has wonderful vocal power which she put on the boil as a woman
scorned. Her voice can simultaneously have a harsh delivery, showing
Santuzza's bitter feelings, and a beautiful, big sound.
   She and tenor Ermanno Mauro, singing Turiddu, blended well,
though they didn't always attack the notes at the same time. Their
duet in which she pleads with him to return contained passionate
singing.
   Baritone Bruno Pola of Rovereto, Italy, made his Met debut as the
farmer whose bride has taken up with Turiddu. He didn't make a
favorable impression.
   Soprano Ilona Tokody of Szeged, Hungary, also made her Met debut
Friday, as Nedda in ``Pagliacci.'' She has a strong vibrato which
sounds unpleasant to Americans, who usually prefer a clear tone.
   Mauro sang in ``Pag'' also. He sounded good in both but didn't
quite make the most of his big ``Pagliacci'' aria ``Vesti la
giubba.'' His finale was stirring.
   The strongest impressions in the second opera were made by Juan
Pons of Ciudadela, Mexico, singing the Prologue in a focused voice
which held the ear's rapt attention without shouting and baritone
Gregg Baker of Memphis, whose singing as Nedda's lover sounded
intensely romantic.
   Alessandro Siciliani of Florence, Italy, made his Met debut
conducting, with more graceful results in ``Cavalleria Rusticana''
than in ``Pagliacci.''

   House and Senate incumbents, perennially better
able to raise money than their challengers, have 14 times more
financial ammunition left to fire than their opponents in the
campaign's final days.
   A report released Friday by the Federal Election Commission,
based on candidates' financial activities through Oct. 19, showed
that office-holders had $94.7 million left to spend, compared to
$6.4 million for their opponents.
   Democratic incumbents held a $13.7 million to $900,000 edge over
GOP challengers in the Senate and a $45.6 million to $1.2 million
advantage in the House. Republican lawmakers had an advantage over
their Democratic challengers of $5.9 million to $2.2 million in the
Senate and $29.5 million to $2.1 million in the House.
   Overall, the report said Senate hopefuls had so far raised $157.5
million, barely $1 million more than in 1986. There are 33 Senate
seat contests this year, one less than there was two years ago.
   Candidates for the 435 House seats have reported raising $202.3
million, 8 percent more than the $187.6 million they collected for
their warchests in 1986.
   Of the total, $119.7 million has been contributed by political
action committees, which are formed by corporations, labor unions,
issue-oriented groups and other organizations to donate money to
candidates.
   On average, Senate candidates have raised two-thirds of their
money from individuals and 24 percent from PACs, the same
percentages as two years ago.
   House contenders have garnered 49 percent of their money from
individuals, down from 51 percent in 1986, and 40 percent from PACs,
up from 35 percent in 1986.
   So far, Democratic incumbents have done a better job of raising
money than their GOP challengers by $47 million to $19.6 million in
the Senate and $88.5 million to $14.7 million in the House. At the
same time, Republican office-holders have collected more than their
Democratic opponents by $41.8 million to $21.7 million in the Senate
and $62.9 million to $17.2 million in the House.
   The five top Senate money raisers, and the amounts they have
collected overall and from PACs, are Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,
$9.9 million, $1.6 million; Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, $7.8
million, $2.1 million; George Voinovich, a Republican running in
Ohio, $7.1 million, $1.2 million; Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
$6.6 million, $884,000; Pete Dawkins, a GOP candidate in New Jersey,
$6.6 million, $734,000.
   The five top House money raisers, and the amounts they have
collected overall and from PACs, are Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., $1.4
million, $62,000; Rep. Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y., $1.3 million,
$314,000; Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., $1.3 million, $250,000; Gary
K. Hart, Democratic candidate in California's 19th District, $1.3
million, $408,000; Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis., $1.2 million, $482,000.

   Sen. Dan Quayle says Governor Michael Dukakis
cannot reconcile talk of the ``Massachusetts miracle'' with the fact
that a state current-accounts fund is nearly $190 million in the red.
   ``We know, right now, that state's revenue collections are way
below estimates,'' Quayle, the Republican vice presidential
candidate, told a campaign rally in this northeastern Louisiana city.
   Appearing later Friday before some 5,000 to 6,000 Auburn
University students, one of the largest Quayle crowds of the
campaign, the senator mocked ``tax hike Mike'' and said young people
should trust George Bush to ensure continued economic prosperity.
   Quayle was touring the mid-Atlantic states of Maryland and West
Virginia today as the long campaign for the White House neared its
conclusion.
   In the Monroe speech, Quayle excoriated Dukakis for the
current-accounts problem, saying it was evidence of mistaken
tax-and-spend policies.
   ``This week the citizens of Massachusetts awoke to find out that
their state's bank accounts have been overdrawn up to $190 million
for the past 30 days,'' he said.
   ``He likes to talk about a Massachusetts miracle,'' Quayle said.
``But the only miracle involving Massachusetts will be the one he
needs to get out of the mess he created for his state.''
   Quayle said that ``despite the totally false denials made by Gov.
Dukakis in his last debate with George Bush, we knew the fiscal
situation was bad.''
   The state constitution in Massachusetts requires a balanced
budget. But the amount of tax receipts that have been coming into
the state's coffers have been less than anticipated by the office of
state treasurer Robert Crane. Consequently, the balance in the
current account accrued a deficit of close to $190 million.
   Governors faced with less-than-expected state tax revenues often
issue what are called revenue anticipation bonds, meaning they
borrow money against the revenue they expect to come in, thus
closing the gap. But in the Massachusetts situation, state officials
apparently opted to pay the interest on the $190 million overdraft
rather than face a higher prevailing interest rate on the floating
of such bonds.
   The state has over $1 billion in separate accounts, but these
monies are untouchable; they involve funds raised through other bond
issues for projects such as highway construction and public works.
   Under the Reagan administration, the federal debt has more than
doubled, surpassing $2 trillion.
   Quayle made his fourth visit to Louisiana, and boasted that he
and Bush have a ``Southern strategy'' that will produce big
victories in the region next Tuesday.
   During the Monroe speech the Indiana senator said, ``I doubt if
Michael Dukakis has been spending too much time in the South. ... He
thinks alligators are something you buy in a shoe store.''

<HEAD>Suspension Of Soviet Troop Pullout Follows Months of Protests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Soviet announcement that it is suspending
its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan culminates months of protests
against the continued arming of Afghan rebels by Pakistan and the
United States.
   The Friday announcement could mark an unraveling of the carefully
crafted U.N. Afghanistan Agreement, signed April 13 in Geneva by the
Soviet Union, the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   That accord was considered the first U.N. victory in years,
resolving a regional conflict and showing Moscow was trying to
extricate itself from such conflicts worldwide.
   The development comes one day after the U.N. General Assembly
adopted its first consensus resolution in which the United States,
the Soviet Union, Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed on Afghanistan.
   U.N. diplomats say some nations may have overestimated Soviet
determination to withdraw from Afghanistan, end an unpopular war and
cut its losses at any cost.
   Washington proudly admits arming the Moslem rebels and denies it
is violating the Afghanistan agreement, but it accuses Moscow of
violating it by aiding the Kabul government and, most recently, by
providing SS-1 Scud missiles and using Backfire bombers.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in Geneva for
Iran-Iraq peace talks, had not seen the Moscow report and had no
immediate comment, U.N. officials said.
   The Soviets on Friday announced the suspension of their troop
withdrawal because of recent Afghan rebel successes and indicated
they might not meet the Feb. 15 withdrawal deadline unless the
attacks stop.
   It was the clearest Soviet statement that continued arming of
Afghan rebels by Pakistan and the United States would not be
tolerated and could jeopardize the withdrawal schedule.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has repeatedly
protested such Pakistani aid, saying it violates the Geneva
agreement's call for non-interference in Afghan and Pakistani
internal affairs.
   Shevardnadze has said the Soviet Union might have to reconsider
and possibly extend its withdrawal schedule if violations and aid to
the rebels continue and that the United States, as a guarantor, must
bear some responsibility.
   In September, Shevardnadze said the Soviets have not yet started
the second phase of their withdrawal. ``Let's wait and see. It is
necessary to stop the violations that take place.''
   He told the General Assembly, ``As soon as Soviet troops began to
withdraw, a non-stop production line of violations was set in
motion.''
   Shevardnadze appealed to the five permanent members of the
Security Council to discuss agreement violations. The five are the
United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union.
   Under the Afghanistan Agreement, the Kremlin agreed to withdraw
half its 100,000 troops from Afghanistan by Aug. 15, and the
remainder by Feb. 15.
   The U.N. observer group of 50 soldiers certified the Soviet
pullout, but the Soviets complained the group operates poorly and
has not investigated violations _ the arming of rebels.
   The agreement also requires non-interference by Afghanistan and
Pakistan in each other's internal affairs. Moscow and Kabul say the
arming of rebels by Pakistan and the United States violates the
agreement. Most of the aid comes from the United States and is
funneled through Pakistan.
   But diplomats say the Americans and Soviets tacitly agreed if one
side continues aiding and arming clients, the other side may do the
same.
   The State Department says the Soviets have used SS-1 Scud
missiles against rebel positions and Backfire bombers to aid Afghan
forces under attack.
   Washington says the introduction of Soviet missiles violates the
accord. Moscow says arming the rebels is a violation.
   On Thursday, for the first time in nine years, when Soviet troops
moved in to Afghanistan, the General Assembly by consensus adopted
its annual Afghanistan resolution without a divisive vote calling
for Soviet withdrawal or criticisms of the Soviet Union.
   This year, a milder resolution expressed satisfaction with the
troop withdrawal and expectation of its completion by Feb. 15. It
was adopted by acclamation, with agreement among the United States,
Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, saying there's nothing wrong with talking to
terrorists as long as no concessions are made: ``I've never said
that you don't negotiate. You talk, you make every effort to get
those hostages back home, but you never make concessions to the
hostage takers.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, denying Americans are turned off by negative
campaigning: ``The idea that this campaign is so different from
others _ I don't believe it. I don't think the American people
believe it, all this stuff about being turned off. You can always go
out and find people to say that. Our people don't say that when I
get off this airplane.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, asked by young Houston student how he got to be
vice president: ``I haven't done it yet.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, blasting Bush for borrowing the Democrat's
standard rallying cry on Thursday: ``Four days before the election,
after all the symbols and slogans, four days before the election, he
tells you he's on your side. Who's he kidding?''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, citing a nearly $190 million overdraft in
Massachusetts' current bank account as evidence Dukakis is
ill-equipped to manage the federal government: ``The American people
are not only just beginning to find out how bad it really is, but
they are finding, as we are, that the fiscal situation in
Massachusetts is a time bomb set to explode in the faces of its
citizens.''
   
   RONALD REAGAN, stumping for Bush: ``If you want to know who's on
the side of the little guy, well, I'll tell you, it's the big guy,
the big guy from Texas.''

   Ground-breaking reforms in Soviet Lithuania are
fueling cautious hope among Lithuanian emigres, but also stirring
discord over the prospect that some degree of independence may be on
the horizon.
   ``We are all a little bit shocked'' by the changes, said Algis
Klimaitis, a Lithuanian dissident who lives in France and works with
the Baltic World Council. He said some people are too quick to
accept the Soviet reforms, ``and some people are too skeptical. We
must find a middle way.''
   The debate over tactics has heated up in the last two weeks
following an inaugural conference in the Lithuanian capital of
Vilnius of the officially sanctioned Movement for Restructuring,
which takes its name from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's plan
of economic and social reform.
   About 20,000 people gathered for the Oct. 22-23 conference, where
more than 1,000 delegates, including many Communist Party members,
adopted resolutions demanding sweeping reforms for Lithuania,
already one of the most progressive of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Emigres who participated in the conference said that within a few
days, the Lithuanian party began to reduce food and medical
privileges enjoyed by its elite members.
   And last week, the newly installed party chief, Algirdas
Brazauskas, announced plans to free several prominent political
prisoners.
   Vytautas Bieliauskas, president of the Lithuanian World Community
and one of a few U.S. citizens allowed to attend the conference,
said ``enthusiasm is quite high'' in Lithuania.
   ``People were sitting at the television _ it was transmitting
everything from the conference _ and people were crying,'' he said
after returning home to Cincinnati, Ohio.
   Bieliauskas, whose organization says it represents a quarter of
the world's 1 million expatriate Lithuanians, received a visa to
attend the conference. But many other emigre activists were refused
permits.
   Some claim that by this move, Soviet authorities were trying to
drive a wedge into the Lithuanian emigre community.
   ``They (the people of Lithuania) are after independence, but the
Soviets only want the economic advantage of free enterprise. People
expect more freedom than they'll get,'' said Ancietas Simiutis,
Lithuania's consul general-in-exile in the United States.
   The Soviet Union absorbed the Baltic republics of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia in 1940 under a secret pact with Nazi Germany.
Nationalists denounced the pact, and several countries, including
the United States, continue to recognize Baltic diplomats who
maintain offices in the West.
   Simiutis is one of many nationalists who are skeptical of
Gorbachev's campaign to reform the Soviet system and permit more
openness about controversial issues.
   ``We think (Bieliauskas) is doing a good job, but (he) might be a
bit naive because he expects more than the Soviets will give,''
Simiutis said. He said the Soviets need Bieliauskas to help
legitimize their ``occupation'' and called his admission to the
conference a ``Soviet trick.''
   Bieliauskas responded that the Lithuanian organization's
executive committee voted 8-1 in favor of him attending the
conference.
   ``(Lithuania) is occupied by the Soviet Union, but it doesn't
mean it doesn't exist. I deal with people, not with the
government,'' Bieliauskas said.
   Bieliauskas said independence could be possible for Lithuania.
   ``But people are not ready. The process has just started. ... I
believe in the process, but it will take time,'' he said.
   Klimaitis of the Baltic World Council said the older generation
wants ``only the reconstruction of the Baltics of the 1918-1940
period (when they were independent). But it looks like there are
other possibilities ... more creative ideas for a new state,'' he
said, speaking by telephone from Strasbourg, France.
   Klimaitis envisioned the republics in a loose confederation with
the central government in Moscow that would have control only over
military and some foreign affairs.
   ``I think this will be possible,'' Klimaitis said, because
Gorbachev realizes the region could become the Soviet Union's ``big
duty-free shop.''
   Soviet Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev last week appeared
to rule out independence for the Baltic republics by saying in a
published interview that Moscow wouldn't let the Baltic states
conduct their own foreign affairs or print their own currency.
   But Bieliauskas maintains his hope for independence, pointing to
a younger generation of activists in Lithuania.
   Klimaitis called the youth's participation the most encouraging
sign he saw.
   ``They have had some days of real freedom, and they will never
forget that.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``virus'' program that infected computers
across the country was created by a graduate student at Cornell
University whose father is one of the government's most respected
computer security experts, The New York Times reported in Saturday's
editions.
   Two sources with detailed knowledge of the case told the Times
that Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, a computer science graduate student
whom friends describe as ``brilliant,'' wrote the set of computer
instructions as an experiment.
   The student could not be reached for comment Friday, the
newspaper reported.
   M. Stuart Lynn, vice president of Cornell's information
technologies, said in a statement early Saturday that the university
had not talked to Morris but confirmed that he was a graduate
student at Cornell.
   ``We are investigating his computer files at Cornell, and so far
we have determined that his account contains files that appear to
hold passwords for some computers at Cornell and Stanford to which
he is not entitled,'' Lynn said. ``We also have discovered that
Morris' account contains a list of passwords substantially similar
to those found in the virus.''
   Earlier, Lynn said the university ``cannot say whether or not he
was responsible for this activity,'' adding: ``We've tried to reach
him but he's not at home. Apparently he's left for Washington. He's
apparently not in Ithaca right now.''
   Several telephone calls to Morris senior's home in Silver Spring,
Md., near Washington, went unanswered. Later, an answering machine
was attached and there was no immediate response to requests for
calls to be returned.
   The virus was introduced into the Arpanet, the Department of
Defense computer network, the Times said. It was intended to live
there innocently and undetected, slowly making copies that would
move from computer to computer, the report said.
   But a design error caused it instead to replicate madly out of
control, ultimately jamming more than 6,000 computers nationwide.
   The virus apparently caused no damage other than the thousands of
hours that computer scientists and programmers were spending to
remove it from their systems. By Friday, universities and research
centers turned their computers back on.
   Sources told the Times the younger Morris flew to Washington
Friday and is planning to hire a lawyer and meet with officials of
the Defense Communications Agency, in charge of the Arpanet network,
to discuss the case.
   His father, Robert Morris Sr., has written widely on the security
of the Unix operating system, the computer master program that was
the target of his son's virus program, of which, the sources said,
he had no prior knowledge.
   The 56-year-old Morris told the Times in a telephone interview
Friday, that the virus was ``the work of a bored graduate student.''
   He said his son was ``for his age very well trained in computer
science: he studied it in college and held various summer jobs at
various places.''
   The Times reported Friday that an anonymous caller to the
newspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as a
harmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when it
got out of hand.
   The elder Morris spoke in the presence of officials and lawyers
of the National Security Agency and would not discuss the case in
detail.
   He is chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center in
Bethesda, Md., the arm of the National Security Agency devoted to
protecting computers against outside attack.
   The elder Morris told the Times that he believed the virus might
ultimately have a positive effect.
   ``It has raised the public awareness to a considerable degree,''
he said. ``It is likely to make people more careful and more
attentive to vulnerabilities in the future.''
   Earlier, the FBI said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to
determine whether federal law had been violated.
   Contacted about the Times report, FBI spokesman Lane Betts said
he could add nothing beyond the prepared statement earlier in the
day.
   ``As the matter is currently under investigation, it would be
inappropriate for me to comment on it,'' Betts said.

   Actor Roddy McDowall has been star-crossed on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
   McDowall, a child actor in ``My Friend Flicka'' and ``Lassie Come
Home'' before moving on to grown-up movies like ``The Planet of the
Apes'' and ``The Poseidon Adventure,'' was honored with a star on
the famous walk in 1960.
   Last summer, the walk was refurbished and his star was replaced.
But when Ana Martinez-Holler of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce
inspected the replacement stars, she discovered McDowall's star read
``MacDowll.''
   So a third star has been ordered, Ms. Martinez-Holler said. It
should take about a week or two to get the new star in place, she
said.
   McDowall, who won an Emmy for his role in ``Not Without Honor''
and a Tony for his work in ``The Fighting Cock,'' can take some
consolation in that it shouldn't take long to right his misguided
star.
   It took 28 years to correct the star belonging to director
Mauritz Stiller. His star, planted in 1960, read Maurice Diller
until last spring.

   Sales by Paul Newman's food company are up
about 25 percent this year, partly because of the highly publicized
civil suit against Newman, the actor said.
   Westport delicatessen owner Julius Gold's suit claims he was
promised 8 percent of the stock of Newman's Own in exchange for his
help in starting the company.
   Newman says the allegation is without merit. A four-week trial
ended last summer in a mistrial. A new trial has not been scheduled.
   On Friday, Newman released a statement saying that net sales from
his food products were $30 million from Jan. 1 through Oct. 31. He
said sales were $24 million in the first ten months of 1987.
   Sales increased 28 percent during the trial, Newman's Own said.
   ``Charity and good intentions sometimes triumph over bad taste
and pastrami,'' Newman said in a statement.
   Newman's Own products include spaghetti sauce, salad dressing,
popcorn and lemonade. Profits are donated to charity; last year that
amounted to more than $5 million.

   Tony Award-winner Frank Langella had to leave
the stage during a matinee performance of ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses'' with a sudden stomach ailment, but it appears his
absence will be brief.
   The actor, best known for stage and screen portayals of Dracula,
went to the theater's wings, leaving co-star Lynn Redgrave on stage
Thursday afternoon. The stage was dark for about 15 minutes while it
was determined whether Langella could continue. Ultimately, the
final half-hour of the performance was completed by understudy John
Castellanos.
   ``He looked a littled peaked during Act 2 and left at the top of
Scene 5,'' said Joyce Friedmann, spokeswoman for the Ahmanson
Theater. ``He left the stage with something like a stomach flu and
proceeded to get very ill.''
   Castellanos also acted in Thursday's evening show, but Langella
visited a doctor Friday and was cleared to return for Friday night's
performance.
   Langella, 48, who won a Tony for his work in ``Seascape,'' plays
a Don Juan-type character in the comedy about decadent Parisienne
aristocracy in the final days before the French Revolution.

   Yoko Ono brought her three-exhibit art
show to Kansas City this week, including a do-it-yourself piece that
once caught the eye of her late husband, ex-Beatle John Lennon, and
led to their 1960s romance.
   Ono, 55, held a news conference Friday to discuss her ``Three
Events'' art show that opens Sunday and hammered the first nail into
the piece called ``Nail It,'' which consists of a painted wooden
panel hung on the gallery wall. Gallery visitors are invited to
hammer their own nails into the piece.
   A display similar to ``Nail It'' caught Lennon's eye at Ono's
showing in 1968 at a London art gallery. The piece _ smaller then
and called ``Hammer a Nail In'' _ prompted an exchange between
Lennon and Ono that led to their highly publicized romance.

   ``Today'' show weatherman Willard Scott
kept a promise he didn't make.
   In late July a woman visited the St. Marys-Kingsland area and
said she was with NBC. Local officials said she began making plans
for Scott and NBC newsman John Palmer to do a documentary on the
community impact of the Navy's nearby Kings Bay submarine base. But
NBC officials said the woman did not work for the network; the plan
was a hoax.
   No matter. Scott came to this town of about 3,500 anyway Friday.
   Of the mystery woman, Scott said: ``Little did she know that she
was dealing with King Kong when she made a promise in my name. I've
never let anybody make a promise in my name that I didn't fulfill in

   Pat Paulsen pulled out of his third
presidential campaign just days before the election, wearily
acknowledging that tongue-in-cheek candidacy never did get off the
ground this year.
   But the deadpan comedian promised Friday that he would be back
soon after the election to launch a run for the White House in 1992.
   Paulsen, 61, traced his failure to a misguided start.
   ``I didn't go to the Iowa caucuses,'' he quipped about the first
big test of the political season. ``I got mixed up and went to
Idaho.''
   Paulsen, a fixture on the old Smothers Brothers comedy show who
offered the nation comic relief as a write-in candidate in 1968 and
1972, said his slogan for next time is ``Pat Paulsen for president:
He's got to sleep somewhere.''

<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
pressed communist authorities to open negotiations with the
opposition during her visit to Poland but also advised the
opposition to act with restraint.
   The Conservative Party prime minister, who returned home late
Friday after a three-day visit, performed a balancing act in her
meetings with government officials and leaders of the outlawed
Solidarity union movment.
   She declared she had no intention of meddling in the country's
internal affairs but then encouraged social strivings for greater
freedom and human rights while urging the government to stay tough
in restructuring its economy.
   After her visit ended, the official PAP news agency reported
public opinion polls showed Mrs. Thatcher was viewed favorably by 52
percent of the Polish population, which it said made her more
popular in Poland than in Britain.
   A ``poll of polls'' issued today by the British Broadcasting
Corp. showed support in Britain for Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative
Party at 47 percent, with Labor second at 35 percent, and smaller
groups trailing far behind. The poll covered the period of Oct.
19-30.
   Saying farewell Friday night to Poland's communist party leader,
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Mrs. Thatcher thanked him for allowing her
to meet with different leaders.
   During her visit she went to Gdansk, the birthplace of
Solidarity, and met with Solidary founder Lech Walesa as thousands
of defiant people cheered her and hooted the government.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who arrived Wednesday, also spent hours in
conversation with Jaruzelski and Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski, hearing their appeals for greater cooperation from the
West in helping Poland tackle its foreign debt problem.
   She was told the government is serious about economic and
political reforms, and that the West should recognize Poland's
achievements.
   Mrs. Thatcher expressed sympathy for the goals, at one point
telling Rakowski he was pursuing the same type of restructuring she
had done in Britain. And she also told him he might have to endure
criticism en route to success.
   She also seemed to express doubts about the pace of reforms and
the government's attempts to set up talks with the opposition, while
showing enthusiasm for Solidarity.
   She was the first Western leader to make the significant gesture
of traveling to Gdansk to talk with Walesa. Solidarity was created
at the Lenin shipyards in Gdansk in fall 1980 and became the first
legally chartered free union movement in the Soviet bloc.
   In December 1981, the union was suspended and it was outlawed the
next year by Parliament.
   Mrs. Thatcher told Walesa his ``leadership has achieved so much.''
   ``I knew that I had to come and feel the spirit of Poland for
myself,'' she told 20,000 Poles who gave her a sustained greeting
outside the Lenin shipyard where Walesa works as an electrician.
   The government announced Monday it would close the shipyard on
Dec. 1. It said the subsidized state industry is losing money.
Opponents called the decision a political attack on Solidarity.
   Mrs. Thatcher avoided commenting on the dispute, telling a news
conference, ``That's not for me. It is for the people of Poland to
decide.''
   The official media gave the Thatcher visit heavy coverage but
omitted mention of her meeting with Walesa.
   Solidarity leaders had hoped she would press authorities to
``recognize reality'' and again make Solidarity a legal organization.
   At a Thursday banquet given by Jaruzelski she linked Western
financial assistance to a government dialogue with the opposition
and said Poland needs political freedom to achieve economic progress.
   That pleased the opposition. ``It was beautiful what she said,''
a senior Solidarity adviser, historian Bronislaw Geremek, told
reporters.
   Poland has a crippling $39 billion foreign debt.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said Friday night it was too
early to assess the visit.
   Urban was asked about Mrs. Thatcher's suggestion that Western
economic aid would be forthcoming if a ``real dialogue'' was
undertaken with Solidarity.
   ``We are skeptical of such attempts to define conditions, and of
such promises,'' he said.

   A severe earthquake rocked the Qinghai region in
central China on Saturday, the Hong Kong Observatory reported.
   The observatory said the quake occurred at 10:19 a.m., and
registered a preliminary magnitude of 6.1 on the Richter scale.
   The quake's epicenter was in the western region of Qinghai, about
372 miles north of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, the observatory
said.
   Further details were not immediately available.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas.
   A top-scale quake of magnitude 8 is a ``great'' earthquake,
capable of tremendous damage in populated areas.

   Larry Williams once sang professionally, Tara
Drzal has never sung in front of an audience before and Mike
Sternberg has been singing for months with a voice described as
fingernails scraped over a chalkboard.
   Even so, the three were among the would-be Sinatras, Madonnas and
Elvises living out fantasies of being a singing star at a recent
Record-A-Hit show at Choice's.
   Tuesday night patrons of the saloon can get up on stage, grab the
microphone and sing along with tapes of hit songs recorded without
the lead vocal.
   ``It makes you feel like a rock star once you loosen up,'' said
Jennifer Nicoll, a college student.
   Larry Corcoran, a bartender at another tavern, said, ``You can be
anybody you want to be up there. It's a fantasy.''
   The singers get a free tape of their performance, said Rob Broms,
a former sales manager who saw a similar audience participation show
in San Francisco 2{ years ago and founded Record-A-Hit in Chicago.
   Record-A-Hit sets up shop at five different Chicago-area
nightclubs each week. The company also does private functions,
special video tapings and even goes on band tours.
   The concept is big business in Japan, where it is known as
``karaoke,'' or ``empty orchestra.''
   ``Everything is free for the customer except the beer,'' said
Rick Asta, Choice's owner. ``This really helps my place's Tuesday
blahs, with bigger crowds.''
   Record-A-Hit offers over 600 selections _ songs from the 1930s to
the 1980s.
   ``I pick songs whose words I'm familar with,'' said Ms. Drzal, a
computer programming trainee.
   Singers get plenty of help _ copies of lyrics, tips on
vocalizing, echoes and other electronic effects, backup singers and
props like sunglasses and cowboy hats.
   Master of ceremonies Steve Morse coaxes people on stage like a
carnival barker.
   ``Make a tape. They're great little stocking stuffers for
Christmas,'' he implored.
   The show attracts an occasional Elvis or Michael Jackson
impersonator.
   At Choice's one Tuesday, Dave Fanning, who works for
Record-A-Hit, did Presley's ``I Can't Help Falling In Love With
You.''
   ``Than' you, you're boo-ful,'' he kept telling the crowd, a la
Elvis.
   ``Gee, Elvis lives,'' yelled Williams, a former professional
singer and current AT&T supervisor who had done Sinatra's ``Summer
Wind'' earlier.
   Dave Sternberg did a rousing ``Hello Dolly'' in a raspy Louis
Armstrong voice.
   Some are kidded for their performances. When J.R. Rainey finished
singing ``Boardwalk,'' his brother, Henry, told the audience,
``J.R.'s supposed to be at a church meeting tonight. I want to see
how he's going to take this tape home and play it for his wife.''
   Although the crowd of about 50 people heard some
less-than-tuneful crooners, there weren't any catcalls.
   Particularly off pitch was Sternberg, a 35-year-old lawyer who
sang Sinatra's ``My Way.''
   ``His voice is like fingernails on a chalk board,'' offered Joy
Bouton, a college student.
   Sternberg's own brother, Mike, agreed.
   ``He can't carry a tune in a suitcase,'' he said.
   But the crowd gave him an ovation when he finished.
   ``You can be as lousy as the day is long but everybody is very
supportive,'' Sternberg said.

   When hundreds of Army paratroopers
made a surprise assault on an airport here, they were ambushed.
   But not to worry _ they were only beset by autograph-seeking
schoolchildren.
   Some 320 paratroopers flew from Fort Bragg, N.C., aboard C-141
transport planes and jumped onto the community airport Thursday in
this north Florida town, practicing how to secure an airfield by
overwhelming the enemy, officials said.
   But after the troopers landed, children from the Keystone Heights
Community Christian Church School ran onto the airfield to talk with
the paratrooper.
   Chad Sanders, 11, was one of about 20 students who chased down
the troopers, who were dressed in combat fatigues and laden with
gear.
   ``The best part was getting all the autographs and seeing how
nice everybody is,'' he said. ``They would give their lives for our
country.''
   Mike Merritt, a teacher at the private school, said the mock
invasion was a good learning activity for the youngsters and would
be used in class discussions.
   Maj. Roger Oliver laughed as he went through a pad of paper,
signing his name. ``We have lots of kids that come out and watch our
exercises, but this is the first time I've been asked for my
autograph,'' he said.

   Pikeville people can't get enough of People

   The weekly publication sold out in stores this week and residents
are scrambling for remaining copies featuring a six-page spread on
the local high school football team.
   ``It's the biggest demand I've ever had,'' said newsstand owner
Travis Goff, who sold all his magazines almost as soon as they
arrived early this week.
   The story about the town and its residents' staunch dedication to
the Pikeville High School Panthers football squad received more
space than any other topic in the Nov. 7 issue.
   Pikeville was undefeated in regular-season play for the second
straight year this fall. The story focuses on the Panthers' 22-0
triumph Oct. 13 over arch-rival Paintsville, which had gone into the
game undefeated.
   Sandy Necessary, distribution manager for East Kentucky News, a

People has sold out this week throughout most of eastern Kentucky.
   ``I can't remember a situation like this,'' she said.

<HEAD>New Soviet Ambassador Says Soviet May Increase Aid to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Soviet ambassador to Nicaragua
said his country may increase aid to Nicaragua.
   ``We support the Sandinista Revolution with all our heart,''
Ambassador Valery Nikolayenko, said Friday in his first news
conference since presenting credentials to President Daniel Ortega
on Oct. 28.
   ``There could be an increase (in aid) as a result of the
additional needs of the Nicaraguan people,'' Nikoloyenko said,
apparently referring to the destruction caused last month by
Hurricane Joan.
   The hurricane, which caused havoc in the Caribbean and Central
America, was blamed for 103 dead and 186,950 homeless in Nicaragua
alone. It also caused considerable damage to Nicaragua's
agricultural production.
   Nikolayenko did not say whether the increased Soviet aid would
include military supplies.
   ``Our aid to Nicaragua is purely defensive,'' he said.
   Nikolayenko estimated Soviet aid at $490 million a year in
credits and donations.
   He said the Soviet Union could increase aid to the Third World
because Moscow has decreased support of state companies and cut its
defense budget. Perestroika, or restructuring, has decreased state
subsidies to Soviet enterprises and the defense budget decreased
after disarmament negotiations in Geneva, the ambassador said.
   Soviet aid to Nicaragua has never dropped from one year to the
next, he said.

   An 11-year-old girl recovering from
injuries sustained when a lawn dart lodged in her brain said it was
good news to hear that federal regulators last week banned the sale
of the game.
   The one-pound, metal-tipped dart penetrated about two inches into
Amy Herron's skull Oct. 25.
   Vanderbilt University Medical Center doctors said she probably
saved herself from bleeding to death by leaving it there as she went
to her mother for help.
   ``I didn't pull it out because I thought it might hurt,'' Amy
said Friday in a conversation with reporters.
   The girl, awake and alert and wondering when she would be allowed
to go home, had been placed in a drug-induced coma for several days
after surgery to minimize damage from the swelling of her brain by
reducing brain activity.
   Recounting to reporters how she was injured, she said, ``We was
playing darts to start with, and they started throwing them up in
the air as far as they could throw them.''
   She said some of her companions were trying to catch the darts as
they came down. ``I didn't want to play and I started to go back
home and I didn't see them throw it, but they threw it and I looked
up and it hit me in the head,'' she said.
   Lamar Tucker, her stepfather, said he was unaware of the
circumstances of Amy's injury as she described it.
   ``We're going to have to check into that,'' he said.
   Previously, the family thought Amy was struck by a dart thrown
toward a ring on the ground _ the proper way to play the game, which
is similar to horseshoes.
   Doctors have told Amy she may be released from the hospital by
Wednesday.
   ``They say I'll have to stay home for a while _ that I won't be
able to go back to school for a while _ but mother is looking into
the possibility of getting a teacher to come by the house,'' said
Amy, who was listed in fair condition Friday.
   The injury caused problems with her vision, but otherwise left
her unscathed, the McMinnville girl said.
   ``When I look at the elevator and try to push the button, it
looks like it's way over there, but it's right here in front of
me,'' she said. ``That's the only change I've noticed. It's the only
thing I can't do very well now that I could do before.''
   Doctors have not commented on whether Amy suffered brain damage
or can expect any long-term problems from the accident.
   ``We have been very pleased at this point with her situation and
are very hopeful for a full recovery,'' said Dr. Bennett Blumenkopf,
her neurosurgeon. ``Her major asset is her age. I would rather be
young than old if I had to recover from anything _ including a
hangover.''
   Last week, the Consumer Product Safety Commission voted to ban
the sale of lawn darts and said the game probably would be off store
shelves by Christmas.
   The darts have been blamed for at least three deaths and several
thousand injuries in recent years.
   The ban did not include a recall, and commission member Carol
Dawson asked the public to keep the darts out of children's hands.

<TEXT>
   Here is a list of recommendations for computer
users for virus prevention and control. It was drafted by the
National LAN Laboratory in Reston, Va., and approved this week by
more than 60 companies:
   1. All software should be purchased from known, reputable sources.
   2. All purchased software should be in its original shrink wrap
or sealed diskette containers when received.
   3. Back-up copies of all original software should be made as soon
as the software package is opened. Back-up copies should be stored
off-site.
   4. All software should be reviewed carefully, by a system
manager, before it is installed on a computer network.
   6. New software should be quarantined on an isolated computer.
This testing will greatly reduce the risk of system virus
contamination.
   7. A back-up copy of all system software and data should be made
at least once a month, with the back-up copy stored for at least one
year before re-use. This will allow restoration of a system that has
been contaminated by a ``time-released'' virus. A plan that includes
``grandfathered'' rotation of back-up copies will reduce risk even
further.
   8. System administrators should restrict access to system
programs and data on a ``need-to-use'' basis. This isolates
problems, protects critical applications, and aids problem diagnosis.
   9. All programs on a system should be checked regularly for
program length changes. Any program-length deviations could be
evidence of tampering, or virus infiltration.
   10. Many shared or free programs are invaluable. However, these
are the prime entry point for viruses. Skeptical review of such
programs is prudent. Also, extended quarantine is essential before
these programs are introduced to a computer system.
   11. Any software that exhibits symptoms of possible virus
contamination should be removed immediately. System managers should
develop plans for quick removal of all copies of a suspect program,
and immediate backup of all related data. These plans should be made
known to all users, and tested and reviewed periodically.

   A witness testified at the trial
of Mohammed Hamadi that during the 1985 TWA hijacking Hamadi calmly
said ``this is the man we killed'' while looking at a Beirut
newspaper.
   Ralf Traugott, a German-born American citizen who was on the
hijacked airliner, also said Friday that he received a mysterious
telephone call recently in which a caller identified himself as a
``Mr. Hamadi.''
   ``About four weeks ago I got a telephone call. I thought it was
kind of strange,'' Traugott said. ``The man on the other end of the
line said `Hello Mr. Ralf.'''
   ``I said, `Who's this?,' and he said, `Mr. Hamadi. This is
Beirut, Lebanon calling,''' Traugott testified.
   He said the man then hung up without mentioning Hamadi's trial.
Traugott was not further questioned about the call and did not say
if he thought it was a threat.
   Hamadi comes from a family of 11 children. An older brother,
Abdul-Hadi, is security chief in Beirut for the fanatical Hezbollah
(Party of God) organization.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder, air
piracy and other crimes in the hijacking. Thirty-nine Americans were
held hostage 17 days and a 23-year-old Navy diver, Rogert Stethem,
was killed in the ordeal.
   Traugott caused a stir in the courtroom when he produced a
Lebanese newspaper, An-Nahar, dated June 16, 1985, two days after
TWA Flight 847 was seized on a flight from Athens to Rome.
   The newspaper's account of the hijacking then in progress at
Beirut airport included photographs of the hijacked plane and a
photograph of Stethem's body lying on the tarmac.
   Traugott said Hamadi had been reading the newspaper aboard the
plane and when ``I asked him what was in it, he said, `This is the
man we killed.' I asked him, `Did you shoot him?'''
   ``He said, `No, my friend shot him,''' Traugott testified. ``He
said it very nonchalantly, like it was no big deal.''
   Hamadi admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied shooting
Stethem. He blamed the killing on his accomplice, identified by
court documents as Hassan Ezzeddine.
   In another conversation on the hijacked plane, Hamadi told
Traugott he was a member of the Hezbollah, and had been trained in
Iran, Traugott testified.
   Hamadi previously denied being a member of Hezbollah, a radical
Lebanese Shiite group backed by Iran.
   Another former American hostage, Steve Willet, testified Friday
and confirmed statements by earlier witnesses that the hijackers
brutally beat the passengers.
   Under guidelines set by the court to protect the witnesses'
security, neither witness named his current residence.
   At the time of the hijacking, Traugott's address was given as
Lunenburg, Mass., while Willet lived in Choupic, La.
   Hamadi declined comment on Friday's testimony.
   Hamadi's Lebanese parents arrived Friday in West Germany to
testify next Tuesday, when the trial resumes, about their son's
childhood in war-torn Beirut.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport in January 1987 as he
tried to smuggle liquid explosives into West Germany.

   An intelligence-gathering satellite
capable of spying on 80 percent of the Soviet Union will be carried
by the secret space shuttle mission scheduled for late this month,
an industry magazine reports.
   ``When fully deployed, the spacecraft will have a span as large
as 150 feet,'' Aviation Week and Space Technology reported. ``It has
the characteristics of an imaging radar or optical reconnaissance
involving digital imaging, or both.
   ``The radar transmission is designed to penetrate cloud cover and
would be valuable in both ocean and land surveillance,'' the
magazine said in its Nov. 7 issue, available Friday.
   Space shuttle Atlantis and its five-man crew will be flying the
third classified Defense Department shuttle mission, and the
Pentagon and NASA have cloaked most details about it in secrecy.
NASA processing director Conrad Nagel said the agency was aiming for
launch on Nov. 28 or 29.
   Aviation Week said the satellite will be launched into an orbit
that will enable it to look down on 80 percent of the Soviet Union.
At least three of the 27 earlier shuttle missions flew over the same
Soviet territory.
   The magazine said the satellite will be dropped overboard from
the cargo bay by an astronaut using the craft's 50-foot robot arm.
Two astronauts are prepared to take a space walk in case there is
trouble deploying the satellite.
   Aviation Week said estimates of the cost of the satellite, filled
with advanced-technology equipment, range as high as $500 million.
It said the satellite could be retrieved on a later shuttle mission
and returned to Earth for improvements.
   Sources who insisted on anonymity earlier told The Associated
Press that Atlantis would carry an intelligence-gathering satellite
that would help U.S. intelligence officials verify that the Soviets
were complying with arms control treaties.
   The sources also said the astronauts will conduct several
experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military observer in
space. The tests would involve coordination with troop and ship
movements and missile launchings on Earth.
   The space shuttle program resumed Sept. 29 with the successful
launch of Discovery, the first shuttle launched since the fatal
explosion of the shuttle Challenger in January 1986.
   During the hiatus, the Pentagon relied on conventional rockets to
send military payloads into space.

<HEAD>Study Finds Widespread Discrimination In Hiring Those Who Might Be
Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employers in metropolitan New York are engaging
in widespread discrimination against legalized aliens and U.S.
citizens who appear to be foreigners, the first such study of its
kind in the nation has found.
   The study by the New York Governor's Task Force on Immigration
Affairs said much of the discrimination apparently stemmed from the
Immigration and Reform Act of 1986, which offered amnesty to
eligible aliens up to May 4 and then imposed stiffer fines and other
sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens.
   The study, begun last month, looked at 400 private employers in
the metropolitan region selected from more than 130,000 private
employers who have more than 4 million people working for them, The
New York Times reported today.
   By extrapolating from the data gathered from those 400, the study
found that more than 22,000 U.S. citizens or aliens who were
authorized to work had been at least temporarily denied employment.
   In their responses, employers indicated confusion about the
legislation or fear of sanctions, the Times said.
   The panel that conducted the study found that employers
discriminated by refusing to accept legally valid proof of
residency, by denying employment to those who experience minor
delays in gathering documentation, and by screening out those
applicants who look or sound foreign.
   Of the employers surveyed, 7 percent admitted they had engaged in
``selective screening'' or had placed more stringent requirements on
job applicants who seemed ``risky'' under the new sanctions.
   The federal General Accounting Office, which is required by
Congress to report evidence of employer discrimination stemming from
the immigration law, is expected to release its annual report Monday.

   Although computer viruses have caused little
damage so far, they ultimately may slow the computer revolution by
requiring the introduction of safeguards that make the machines less
convenient and accessible.
   ``What I think it does is spell the end of the user-friendly
era,'' said Richard tenEyck, telecommunications director of the
Boston Computer Society.
   ``The brave new world of computing, I think, is still becoming a
reality. But there's a (need for a) gatekeeper,'' he said Friday.
   A computer virus is a program that ``infects'' other programs by
modifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from one
computer to another and alter or destroy data.
   Viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phone
lines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a
computer.
   A virus that swept the country this week temporarily crippled the
computing centers of many universities and research centers.
Business began to return to normal Friday as computer operators
cleaned out copies of the rapidly multiplying program.
   In attempts to control viruses, there will be much stricter
limits on who can use certain programs and data bases and under what
conditions. This will make it harder for people to work together in
computer networks.
   New pieces of software, no matter how seemingly beneficial, will
be tested at length, especially if they come from insecure sources.
   Certain programs that check for evidence of contamination will be
run every time someone sits down to use a piece of software, causing
frustrating delays.
   There could even be delays in everyday activities such as using a
credit card.
   In short, steps to protect against computer viruses may drain
computers of two of their most important attributes: speed and
accessibility.
   Even with time-consuming and expensive precautions, viruses will
remain a problem.
   Once a computer has been contaminated with a virus it is almost
impossible to ensure that every trace of the virus has been
eradicated, said Mary Carol Chruscicki, program manager for system
reliability at a Rome, N.Y., institute that performs studies for the
Defense Department.
   Some people have expressed concern that the danger of computer
viruses will turn the clock back to the days when the only computers
were mainframes in locked ``glass houses,'' operated by people in
white coats.
   Ms. Chruscicki said she does not think that will happen.
   ``The world of information is here and computer users don't want
to go back to where they're sheltered from what's out there, whether
it's a low-cost product or a free product,'' she said.
   ``The key issue is that with proper precautions, one can continue
to live a normal existence,'' said Delbert Jones of the National LAN
Laboratory in Reston, Va.
   More than 60 companies this week endorsed a set of guidelines
drafted by the National LAN Laboratory that are intended to prevent
and control viruses.
   Among the recommendations:
   _All software should be purchased from known, reputable sources.
   _New software should be quarantined on an isolated computer for
testing.
   _Back-up copies of all master software and computer data should
be made at least once a month so the back-ups can be used if the
current versions are corrupted by a virus.
   ``It's very much like the AIDS virus: The best solution is
precaution,'' Jones said.

   The FBI says it is studying whether a
nationwide computer ``virus'' attack on a Defense Department
computer network broke federal law.
   FBI spokesman William Carter said Friday a criminal investigation
would be launched if a preliminary inquiry determined that federal
law had been violated.
   The bureau will review the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which
deals with unauthorized access to government computers or computers
in two or more states.
   If records within the computer systems that were ``infected'' are
found to have been destroyed or harmed, the FBI could conduct a
full-scale investigation, Carter said.
   The virus is an unauthorized computer program that officials this
week said reproduced in computers nationwide and apparently
instructed them to send copies of itself to other machines through a
research network, Arpanet.
   Although there was no apparent damage, computers were turned off
as they became overloaded with material.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the virus
program was created by a graduate student at Cornell University,
Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, whose father is one of the government's
most respected computer security experts.
   Two sources with detailed knowledge of the case told the Times
that Morris wrote the set of computer instructions as an experiment.
The virus was intended to live in the Arpanet undetected, slowly
making copies that would move from computer to computer, the report
said. But a design error caused it instead to replicate madly out of
control, ultimately jamming more than 6,000 computers nationwide.
   M. Stuart Lynn, Cornell's vice president for information
technologies, said early today the university had not talked to
Morris but was investigating his computer files.
   ``So far we have determined that his account contains files that
appear to hold passwords for some computers at Cornell and Stanford
to which he is not entitled,'' Lynn said in a statement. ``We also
have discovered that Morris' account contains a list of passwords
substantially similar to those found in the virus.'' Passwords are
the codes needed to gain access to computer systems.
   The Ithaca, N.Y., school scheduled a news conference for today.
   Several telephone calls to the family's home in Silver Spring,
Md., near Washington, went unanswered. Later, an answering machine
was attached and messages left on it were not returned.
   The younger Morris also could not be reached. The university said
it did not have a local address for him, and Lynn said college
officials believed he was on his way to Washington.
   Arpanet, established by the Defense Department's Advanced
Research Projects Agency, is used by researchers and defense
contractors to share data.
   Officials said the virus also spread into some government
computers, from NASA's Langley Research Center at Hampton, Va., to
the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
   At Los Alamos, computer security officer Jimmy McClary said the
virus had caused no damage but a few hundred scientists suffered
delays in their work.
   Dr. Raymond S. Colladay, the director of the Advanced Research
Projects Agency, told a Pentagon briefing the virus had been
defeated in roughly 24 hours' time after being spotted Wednesday
evening.
   He said the Pentagon was confident the computer network had
resumed normal operations.
   ``It was a benign virus; by that I mean it didn't destroy
files,'' Colladay said.
   Colladay said the computer experts and researchers who use the
system had concluded the virus program _ while fairly sophisticated
_ did not contain any ``Trojan horse'' bug that could crop up again
at a later time.
   Colladay said he had ordered a new study by his agency of the
security procedures used by Arpanet. He said Pentagon officials
purposely had designed the network as an ``open'' system and
deliberately rejected various security procedures in the past on
cost grounds.
   Colladay and Col. Thomas M. Herrick, the manager of the Defense
Data Network, said the Arpanet differed significantly from the
computer networks that handle classified military information.
Herrick said there was never any danger or possibility the virus
could have jumped from the Arpanet to a classified system.
   The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits gaining access to a
``federal interest computer without authorization'' and engaging in
conduct which ``alters, damages or destroys information.''
Conviction carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
   One of the definitions of a federal interest computer is one of
two or more computers used in committing an offense which are not
all situated in the same state.

   A computer ``vaccine'' that would block
the invasion of a computer virus like the one that swept the nation
this week is under development by scientists at Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
   Los Alamos' computer security officer Jimmy McClary said two main
efforts are under way to guard against future viral attacks, both
``using computers more to get to people who are attacking
computers.''
   ``The first is to use computers to guard computers against
viruses _ enhanced intrusion detection techniques that let you look
for unexpected or unexplained changes in the behavior of a computer
system,'' he said Friday.
   ``The other approach ... is to develop anti-viral code _
vaccines, if you like, to carry the analogy further _ that amount to
self-examining code, so the code itself will know if someone makes
an unauthorized change to it.''
   Computer security experts said the virus made life inconvenient
for researchers at universities and research centers, but did no
known permanent damage and did not enter classified computers.
   The New York Times reported today that the virus was created by
Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, a Cornell University graduate student.
   Morris' father, chief scientist of the National Security Agency's
National Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md., said the virus
could ``make people more careful and more attentive to
vulnerabilities in the future.''
   The younger Morris could not be reached for comment.
   McClary said scientists at Los Alamos, a federal nuclear weapons
research center, were able to identify the virus and cleanse it from
the lab's system.
   ``The most useful aspect of these sort of events is that they
occur in an unclassified, non-sensitive environment that lets us
look at the techniques used to introduce these viruses,'' said
McClary.
   The virus infiltrated the Defense Department network that links
computers at scientific laboratories nationwide, infecting Los
Alamos, its sister Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California, and numerous other government and private research
centers.
   ``This is the largest-scale virus attack that I have seen that
was distributed across the country,'' McClary said.
   A computer virus is a program that ``infects'' other programs by
modifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from one
computer to another and alter or destroy data. This virus did its
damage by making repeated copies of itself, slowing computer
processing and eating up computer memory space.
   Viruses usually are communicated by data transmission over phone
lines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a
computer.
   McClary said scientists working at remote terminals, all using
the Unix operating system, began experiencing delays in gaining
access to their research data late Wednesday. He said he believes
the first clues occurred about an hour after the virus entered the
computers.
   Thursday morning, laboratory scientists disconnected the access
route of the virus, the electronic mail system by which scientific
data is transmitted among research institutions, he said.
   Later that morning, the U.S. Department of Energy informed the
lab the computer virus existed.
   Los Alamos and the other laboratories will analyze the virus code
to determine its source, McClary said.
   ``What they'll have to do is follow each path that they're able
to pick up at some point and go back along that path,'' he said.
``Generally, you can trace back. We don't know yet enough about this
one. This one does a fair job of cleaning up after itself.''

<HEAD>Rivera Undergoes Nose Surgery; Cancels `Saturday Night Live'
Appearance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talk-show host Geraldo Rivera underwent surgery
on his broken nose and will skip a scheduled appearance on tonight's
``Saturday Night Live,'' his spokesman said.
   Rivera's nose was broken Thursday in a brawl that broke out
during the taping of an episode of his syndicated TV show on Young
Hatemongers.
   His spokesman, Jeff Erdel, said Rivera was ``groggy and very
uncomfortable'' after nearly three hours of surgery at a doctor's
office Friday.
   The doctor ordered Rivera, bandaged and wearing a splint on his
nose, to stay in bed.
   Dinah Minot, associate producer of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,''
said Rivera was to appear with Morton Downey Jr., another
controversial talk-show host, on a ``Church Lady'' segment,
featuring comedian Dana Carvey as the prissy moderator of a
religious talk show.
   The free-for-all Thursday, which lasted about a minute, started
when John Metzger, leader of the White Aryan Resistance Youth,
called Roy Innis, chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, an
``Uncle Tom.''
   Innis got out of his chair and grabbed Metzger by the neck and
other supremacists stormed the stage, ``like a bench-clearing brawl
at a hockey match,'' Rivera said afterward.
   Rivera's nose was broken by a chair that became airborne during
the fracas.

   An earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter Scale
struck a thinly populated region of western China today, the State
Seismological Bureau reported.
   The bureau said the quake hit the Tanggula Mountain range along
the border of Qinghai province and Tibet at 10:14 a.m.
   It said the epicenter was near the mouth of the Yangtze River,
about 310 miles north of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, in the
snow-covered Tanggula range. Peaks in the region, inhabited mainly
by nomads, rise to 19,680 feet above sea level.
   An official at the bureau, contacted by telephone, said there was
no information about damage or injuries and efforts were being made
to contact the seismological bureau in Xining, the Qinghai capital.
   The Richter Scale measures the total strength of an earthquake as
recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number represents a
tenfold increase in magnitude.
   A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. A
quake measuring 7.0 on the Richter Scale could cause devastating
damage in a populated area.
   A top-scale quake of magnitude 8 is a ``great'' earthquake,
capable of tremendous damage in populated areas.

   Ten years ago, when Bob Beal paid $7,500 for a
parking space on tony Beacon Hill, some of his friends thought he
was nuts.
   But this year, two spots in the same garage changed hands for
$135,000 each _ and 10 more buyers put their names on a waiting
list. So who's nuts now?
   ``I'd say it looks like it was a pretty good investment,'' Beal
said. ``Wouldn't you?''
   Of course, not all parking in this city is so expensive. A space
in the garage under the Boston Common goes for $110 a month. All you
have to do is sign up and wait your turn _ which, at the present
rate, would come in about seven years, according to the state agency
that runs the 1,500-car garage.
   While prices on Beacon Hill and the wait at the Common may be
extreme examples, there is no question that parking has become
expensive, time-consuming and frustrating in downtown Boston.
   On an average day, according to a recent study by the city's
transportation department, 99 percent of the spaces in the financial
district are filled by 10 a.m. By noon, the occupancy rate rises to
102 percent _ the extra 2 percent reflecting illegally parked
vehicles.
   While many major cities have similar problems, Boston's is
particularly acute, because the parking supply has been frozen since
1973, when the federal Environmental Protection Agency and a state
environmental agency set a cap of 35,500 spaces in an effort to
control smog.
   Only a few cities have such caps _ others include neighboring
Cambridge and Portland, Ore. _ and in the face of public
exasperation, the city is preparing to seek a partial reprieve.
   Early next year, said Transportation Commissioner Richard A.
Dimino, the city will present a plan calling for the addition of
5,000 spaces.
   In addition, the city is trying to encourage car and van pools by
reserving spaces for them in municipal garages. And it is looking to
build new garages in outlying areas.
   To get the new spaces, Boston will have to prove to the
environmental agencies that lifting the cap ``would not make the air
quality situation any worse, and, preferably, would make an
improvement,'' said Barbara Kwetz, a state air pollution regulator.
   To a large extent, Boston's parking problem is a matter of simple
geography: Downtown covers less than 2 square miles, and is bound by
Boston Harbor to the west and the Charles River to the north and
east.
   But the crunch also has been exacerbated by a building boom in
which high-rent office buildings have drawn more workers and, in
some cases, supplanted parking lots or garages.
   City officials contend that there is no lack of parking
enforcement. Boston's corps of parking officers has jumped almost 50
percent in the last year, from 65 to 95, and the city has been
issuing tickets at the rate of 150,000 a month.
   Still, a $15 ticket can seem cheap compared to the price of
parking in a garage. According to the transportation department, the
average hourly rate across the city is $3.60, but in some areas,
like the Back Bay, it goes as high as $6.
   Already, several of the city's largest companies _ including New
England Telephone, Fidelity Investments and the Bank of Boston _
formed an organization named Friends of Post Office Square that
broke ground last month for a 1,400-car underground garage in the
heart of the financial district.
   A good measure of the value of downtown parking was provided by
the organization's sale of 450 shares of preferred stock in the
garage. Each share entitles the owner to rent a space in the garage
for the regular monthly fee, expected to be about $340.
   All 450 shares were sold in advance _ for $65,000 each.

   Harvard University has agreed to recognize a
3,500-member union at the school after a bitter, 13-year organizing
drive.
   Adopting a conciliatory tone, Harvard President Derek Bok said
Friday the university decided against appealing a judge's recent
ruling that the union won a fair election in May.
   ``With this decision, and the expected certification (of the
union) by the (National Labor Relations) Board, we will commence a
new chapter in our relations with the Harvard Union of Clerical and
Technical Workers,'' Bok said. ``I will work to make this
relationship as constructive and harmonious as possible.''
   Anne Taylor, a Harvard administrator responsible for union
relations, said the university hurriedly printed up several thousand
``We'll Make It Work'' buttons in the school colors of crimson and
white, and handed them out to coincide with Bok's announcement.
   ``I hope people see this as a positive statement by Harvard about
how we're going to approach this situation, because that's the way
it was intended,'' she said.
   The union drive, which began in 1975, was viewed by national
labor leaders as a test case for organizing white-collar workers.
   ``Derek Bok's statement is the most respectful gesture that
Harvard could have made to its employees right now,'' said union
organizer Kristine Rondeau.
   Harvard, with its main campus in Cambridge, and the union have
agreed to 60 days of informal talks before entering contract
negotiations, Rondeau said.
   The union, which represents non-professional employees at the Ivy
League college, is affiliated with the 1.1 million-member American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
   Noting that 83 percent of the Harvard union's members are women,
AFSCME President Gerald McEntee said, ``The Harvard victory is
enormous and broadly meaningful _ and will help women in work places
all over the country.''
   The union won the May 17 election by a margin of 1,530 to 1,486.
Harvard filed a series of legal objections to the vote, contending
that union organizers kept track of voters at the polls and used
coercive tactics.
   After hearings in August, an administrative law judge issued a
strongly worded decision Oct. 24 dismissing Harvard's objections.

<HEAD>In Breakthrough, LOT Polish Airlines To Acquire 3 Boeing Jets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's national airline established two firsts
by ordering advanced U.S. aircraft and planning to offer two classes
of service in the new jets.
   Boeing Co. will sell three 767 wide-body jets to LOT Polish
Airlines, marking the first time a Soviet bloc nation has purchased
modern, American jets. The deal, announced Friday, is worth $220
million to Boeing and General Electric Co., the engine supplier.
   LOT also said it would offer business- and economy-class service
on the jets. Only one class of service currently is offered on the
Soviet-made aircraft that make up LOT's 45-plane fleet.
   The state-owned airline said the three jets would be used on
flights linking Poland with the United States and Thailand. It said
they should help double its traffic between Poland and the United
States as early as next year.
   The moves were seen as the first attempt by an Eastern bloc
airline to compete with Western concerns for Western passengers,
particularly business travelers, who pay higher fares but also
demand a high level of service.
   Boeing officials said they hoped the deal, though relatively
small, would lead to more deals with Poland and other Soviet bloc
nations.
   ``We're very proud and pleased that we were selected. It's a
major breakthrough for us,'' said Rudy Hillinga, director of sales
for Central and Eastern Europe for Boeing Commercial Airplanes Co.
   Boeing said it will be the first to deliver modern, wide-body
jets made in the West to a Soviet bloc nation because it will
deliver its first two planes to Poland before Europe's Airbus
consortium delivers two A-310s to East Germany under a previously
announced deal.
   Boeing will deliver two 767-200s in April and May 1989 and one
767-300 in June 1990. All will be extended-range models, powered by
General Electric CF6-80C2 engines. Boeing declined to specify how
the $220 million price was split between Boeing and GE.
   Although Poland has a desperate shortage of hard currency to buy
Western goods, the airline is an exception because it brings in hard
currencies every time it flies to the West. That made the financing
relatively easy.
   In a deal financed by unspecified Western banks, LOT will lease
the airplanes and engines for 12 years, at the end of which it will
own them, Hillinga said. Boeing and GE will be paid by the banks.
   LOT said it will use the jetliners on its routes between Warsaw
and New York, Chicago and Bangkok, Thailand. Later, Montreal and
Toronto will be added.

<HEAD>Black Officers Allege Discrimination In Dallas Police Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five black police officers filed a $55 million
federal lawsuit against the Dallas Police Department, alleging the
department ``intentionally mistreats its black officers.''
   The filing of the suit Thursday came less than two months after
the 207-member Black Firefighters Association filed another
discrimination suit against the city.
   Both lawsuits claim that longstanding discrimination by white
supervisors prevented black officers from advancing.
   The city denied the firefighters' charges. First Assistant City
Attorney Kenneth Dippel said Friday he had not yet seen the
pleadings in the latest lawsuit.
   ``It'd be inappropriate for me to comment at this time,'' he said.
   Defendants in the police suit are the city, former Police Chief
Billy Prince, current chief Mack Vines, Mayor Annette Strauss and
City Manager Richard Knight.
   The suit claims black officers don't receive equal treatment in
hiring, discipline and promotional consideration.
   ``The DPD intentionally mistreats its black officers,'' said C.
Victor Lander, a lawyer representing the five officers.
   It also requests class-action status to include all of the
estimated 300 black officers on the 3,100-member force.
   ``We realize we're going to receive some criticism from white
officers, and also some of the black officers,'' said Calvin Howard,
chairman of the National Black Police Association and one of the
five plaintiffs. ``A lot of young black officers are not familiar
with problems that have gone on in the past.''
   City Councilwoman Diane Ragsdale agreed that black officers face
discrimination. ``The concerns are quite legitimate,'' said
Ragsdale, who is black.
   The police department has been criticized this year for its use
of deadly force and its relations with minority communities.
   The issue came to a head in January when a white officer was shot
in the face three times with his own gun by a black homeless man
described as mentally ill. Two witnesses said the shooter was urged
on by a few young black men who yelled: ``Shoot him, shoot him!''

   A U.S. vice consul jumped into a chilly river to
save a drowning man who fell off a bridge, police said today.
   John Brennan, 38, a vice consul in Osaka, was driving to work
Friday with an unidentified colleague when they saw Masami Kamura,
48, fall from a bridge railing and plunge into the river, police
said.
   Brennan stripped to his underwear and dived in, the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The official said Kamura fell into the water when he and a friend
tried to walk on the bridge railing while intoxicated.
   The New Jersey diplomat, his hometown unknown, began working in
Osaka in July, the newspaper Asahi Evening News said.
   Brennan was not immediately available for comment.

   Two men acquitted of kidnapping and conspiracy
charges for abducting a Unification Church member and trying to
``deprogram'' her were relieved by the verdict and said they would
continue to work with cult members.
   ``I think (the verdict) is telling people there is such a thing
as coercive persuasion and saying people have the right to religious
freedom. Cults take those rights away from people,'' said Dennis
Whelan, 53, of Omaha, Neb.
   He and Robert Brandyberry, 41, of Columbus, Ohio, were acquitted
Friday after six hours of deliberation.
   Brandyberry, who cried after the verdict, and Whelan said they
would continue their work in some way.
   Using the rare ``choice-of-evils'' defense, the men contended
their actions were permissible because they intended to ``rescue''
the woman from a greater evil, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification
Church.
   They were charged with second-degree kidnapping and conspiracy in
the May 26, 1987, abduction of Britta Adolfsson, 30, from a Denver
street. The defendants had faced two to eight years in prison for
kidnapping and one to four years for conspiracy.
   ``This is a rescue, ladies and gentlemen, not a kidnapping,''
Whelan's attorney, James Martin Davis, said in closing arguments
Thursday. ``What Denny and Bob did was a necessary emergency measure
to avoid permanent injury.''
   Tord and Margit Adolfsson, the woman's parents, paid the
defendants about $8,000 to abduct and deprogram their daughter
because they thought she was going to South Korea to participate in
a second ``mass marriage.'' The Swedish woman's 1982 marriage,
performed during a mass wedding ceremony by the church, ended in
divorce in 1985.
   Deprogramming entails persuading a person to abandon rigid
commitment to certain values or beliefs of a cult by undoing the
effects of indoctrination.
   Prosecutors argued that Whelan, a private detective, and
Brandyberry, a deprogrammer and ex-Unification Church leader, were
motivated by money and hatred for the organization. Moreover, the
defendants created the ``emergency'' by playing on the family's
unfounded fear that the woman was being brainwashed and on the brink
of marriage, they said.
   Jeffrey Pagliuca, Brandyberry's lawyer, said Adolfsson, although
29 at the time of the abduction, was ``a naive little school girl''
when she came to the United States in 1979 as an exchange student
and was lured into the cult in 1980.
   Britta Adolfsson had said she was terrified by the abduction,
which ended when she escaped from a Lyons, Kan., house by jumping
through a second-story window. She remains a Unification Church
member.
   Unification Church President Mose Durst said the judge erred in
allowing the case to be tried.
   ``To put a religion on trial is to contradict everything in the
Constitution. The ramifications of this are horrible, especially for
minority religions,'' Durst said.

<HEAD>TV Network Files Complaint Over Seizure Of Videotapes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By K.P. HONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading television network went to court today
demanding prosecutors return seized videotapes allegedly showing a
businessman offering bribes to a lawmaker involved in a stock
trading scandal.
   The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office, investigating the
alleged bribery case, seized four master tapes from the Nippon
Television Network Corp. on Tuesday.
   Kyoichi Tokiwa, a network official, told a news conference today
his company filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court, seeking an
injunction against the seizure that he said ``violates freedom of
the press as guaranteed by the constitution.''
   The videotapes contain scenes, some broadcast by the network,
that reportedly show Hiroshi Matsubara, a Recruit-Cosmos Co.
official, offering cash packets to Yanosuke Narazaki, an opposition
party member of Parliament.
   Narazaki has been a leader of a parliamentary probe into a
scandal involving the sale of Recruit-Cosmos shares to dozens of
politicial leaders and other prominent people at bargain prices
before the stocks were publicly traded.
   When the shares were listed on the over-the-counter market in
1986, they quickly rose in value and the purchasers made large
profits.
   Network officials said they made the videotapes with Narazaki's
cooperation after he told them Matsubara tried several times to
bribe him $40,000 to tone down his investigation.
   The tapes reportedly were made with a hidden camera Aug. 30 and
Sept. 3 at Narazaki's residence near Parliament. After some scenes
were aired, Matsubara was arrested Oct. 20 and charged with
attempted bribery.
   Top politicians, including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita,
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, say they were not directly involved but that aides bought
the shares.
   Opposition officials and newspaper reports say at least 140
people and more than 1.2 million Recruit-Cosmos shares were involved.
   Government officials have said the stock sales were not illegal
unless they involved political or other favors in return. But the
case has raised ethical questions about links between business and
politics in Japan.
   Opposition parties say Hiromasa Ezoe, founder of Recruit-Cosmos'
parent company, Recruit Inc., offered the unlisted shares to
politicians, business leaders and others in exchange for privileges
and special favors for his company.

<TEXT>
   A law giving Orthodox rabbis sole authority over
conversions to Judaism stands a good chance of being passed by the
new parliament, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in an interview
broadcast today.
   The so-called ``Who Is A Jew'' law has been denounced as
discriminatory by American Jews. More than 80 percent of the 6
million U.S. Jews who are affiliated to congregations belong to
Reform or Conservative movements.
   The law is a key demand of four Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox
religious parties engaged in coalition talks with Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc after Tuesday's general election.
   Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member Parliament, and needs the 18
seats of the religious parties to form a majority government that
would also include extreme right-wing parties. Sixty-one seats are
needed to govern.
   The ``Who Is A Jew'' law does not appear to be a sticking point
in the coalition talks. Most Likud legislators, including Shamir,
voted for the proposed law when it was last put to a vote in 1987.
At the time it was narrowly defeated.
   ``If there are now more Parliament members who agree to this (the
law) there are more chances that it will pass,'' Shamir said on
Israel radio.
   Israel's Law of Return, which grants automatic citizenship to all
Jews, defines Jews as those born to a Jewish mother or converted to
Judaism. The amendment demanded by the Orthodox would change the
definition to read: ``Converted according to Orthodox Jewish law.''
   Although the law would not disqualify most Conservative or Reform
Jews, movement leaders have said it would symbolically expel them
from the Jewish fold and alienate them from Israel.
   But Shamir dismissed such concerns. ``Before every vote on some
religious law, there is a big noise among American Jews,'' Shamir
told Israel radio. ``I think there is a lot of exaggeration. I'm
convinced we'll reach some understanding with the American Jews.''
   Shamir also sought to allay fears by secular Israelis that Likud
would give in to blackmail by the religious parties that demand a
ban on driving, movies and soccer on the Jewish Sabbath.
   ``I don't foresee any decisive chances,'' Shamir said. ``Everyone
will be able to continue to live as he does now.''
   He did not specify which demands by the religious parties the
Likud would reject or accept.
   Shamir reiterated that he rejected demands by potential extreme
right-wing coalition partners to annex the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip and to expel the 1.5 million Palestinians living there.
   He told Israel radio that the Likud stuck by the 1978 Camp David
accords, which says the final status of the occupied lands should be
determined by negotiations between the parties to the conflict.
   Despite the differences, Shamir said he was confident he could
put together a coalition soon. ``Certainly, it will not be easy, but
a government will be formed,'' he said.
   The left-of-center Labor Party, which won 39 seats, also held
coalition talks with the religious parties, but its chances of
forming a government are seen as slim.
   Many top Labor officials have urged party leader Shimon Peres to
stop the negotiations and accept a role in the opposition.

<HEAD>Metropolitan General Manager Announces Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general manager of the Metropolitan Opera
surprised the company with his announcement that he will step down
to become chief executive officer of a New York-based corporation.
   Bruce Crawford, 59, announced Friday that he will quit as of
April 1 but will remain on the board of directors and executive
committee.
   In an interview published in today's New York Times, he denied
that there had been any limitations on his authority or personality
clashes. He said he had resigned solely because of the appeal of his
new position. He would not disclose his new employer's name.
   ``There is nothing that the Met could have done in light of the
opportunity that has presented itself to me,'' he said.
   The Met learned of Crawford's decision during its Friday morning
rehearsal of ``Carmen,'' when an announcement was posted, said
Johanna Fiedler, a company spokeswoman.
   ``I think everybody is extremely surprised. It was totally
unexpected,'' she said.
   As administrative head of the opera company, Crawford has been
credited with stabilizing it financially and artistically. Fiedler
noted that he has ``increased the box office percentage and reduced
the deficit.''
   In 1983-84, the season before Crawford became president of the
company, the Met ran a deficit after contributions of $8 million. In
the last two seasons it has essentially broken even.
   Louise Humphrey, president of the Met board, said, ``While we're
very sorry Bruce Crawford is resigning as general manager, we
understand his desire to return to the corporate world.''
   She said the executive committee would form a search committee to
look for a successor.
   Crawford left his position as chief executive officer of BBDO
International Inc., the sixth-largest advertising company in the
world, to become the Met's general manager.
   The Times said Cawford received a salary of $750,000 at BBDO,
according to proxy statements. The newspaper said Met officials
would not reveal his salary as general manager but did not deny
reports that it was about $300,000.

   An ethnic Albanian policeman has been
sentenced to five years in jail for assaulting a Serbian Orthodox
nun in ethnically troubled Kosovo province, newspapers reported
today.
   The district court of Pristina, capital of the southern province,
ruled Friday that policeman Ahmet Ljatifi on Aug. 28 ``physically
attacked'' Abess Tatjana, head of the Gracanica Orthodox monastery,
the Politika daily reported.
   Tatjana, in her early sixties, said in a recent interview that
the policeman, in his early thirties, grabbed her that night in the
monastery yard, threatening to rape her. She said she managed to
free herself.
   The attack ``has triggered anxiety'' among the Serbian minority
in the province, the newspaper quoted the court as saying. The court
added Ljatifi was aware of what he was doing, even though he was
``under slight influence of alcohol.''
   Thousands of Serbs protested near the monastery after the
incident.
   Kosovo's Slav minority claims it is being harassed, intimidated
and forced to leave the region by ethnic Albanians who make up 90
percent of the province's population.
   The majority of Kosovo's Albanians are Moslems, compared to the
mostly Orthodox Serbs and Montenegrins.
   Ethnic tensions in Kosovo have prompted demonstrations throughout
Serbia and Montenegro calling for more Serbian control of the
southern province, Yugoslavia's poorest.

   Staffers of Atlanta's two daily newspapers
expressed dismay over the resignation of their top editor, who cited
a lack of ``shared values and mutual trust'' with the newspapers'
senior management.
   Bill Kovach, who left the top post at The New York Times'
Washington bureau to take over the Journal and Constitution in
December 1986, announced his resignation Friday.
   Stunned staffers then gathered 119 signatures on a petition
urging Publisher Jay Smith to reconsider his acceptance of Kovach's
resignation.
   And a full-page advertisement in today's combined editions of the
papers _ which are essentially one newspaper with different
editorial pages _ was purchased and signed by 123 of the paper's
approximately 400 staffers.
   It said they were ``deeply saddened by the sudden resignation of
Editor Bill Kovach. We are disturbed that it was so readily
accepted.''
   According to a story in Friday's editions of The Atlanta Journal,
Smith said, ``An irreconcilable difference in management styles
surfaced in a discussion Friday morning.''
   Smith said that although he and Kovach were ``in accord
philosophically over the direction the newspapers have taken,'' the
management difference caused him to accept the editor's resignation.
   Kovach said his resignation brought to an end ``two years of
effort to develop a set of shared values and mutual trust with the
senior managers of the company. ... It became clear this week that
no such relationship existed.''
   Exactly what precipitated Friday morning's developments was
unclear. Neither the Journal's story nor Kovach's statement went
into detail.
   But according to today's edition of The New York Times, some
staffers suggested that the newspapers' management had been under
pressure to rein in Kovach because of his aggressive business-news
coverage.
   Kovach reportedly riled some of the city's most highly visible
corporate citizens with articles that included descriptions of
discriminatory lending practices in Atlanta's poorest neighborhoods.
   Spokesmen for concerns including The Citizens and Southern
National Bank, Coca-Cola Co. and Georgia Power Co. told the Times
that the companies had played no role in Kovach's departure.
   Smith said only that the disagreement was ``fairly narrowly
focused.'' He acknowledged that he and Kovach differed on several
issues, including control of the newspapers' Washington bureau and
the amount of money to be committed to covering news.
   He said the budget dispute was settled several weeks ago, but
Smith declined to comment on whether their dispute over control of
the Washington bureau was related to Kovach's resignation.

   The Soviet Union's decision to suspend
its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan violates the Geneva accords
and raises doubts about Moscow's commitment to end the war, a top
Pakistani official said today.
   Moscow announced the suspension Friday and said it sent advanced
weapons to Afghanistan because of unrelenting pressure from Moslem
guerrillas. Witnesses have reported seeing MiG-27 jets and SS-1 Scud
missiles in Afghanistan.
   The Soviets also accused the United States and Pakistan of
violating the Geneva withdrawal agreement by sending arms to the
insurgents.
   The Soviet actions reflected Moscow's frustration over how the
Afghan army has handled the fight in the nearly three months since
the Red Army reached the halfway point in withdrawning its estimated
115,000 men.
   The announcement Friday appeared to indicate the Soviet
withdrawal might not be completed by the Feb. 15 deadline set in the
April 14 Geneva agreement mediated by the United Nations. The
withdrawal began May 15.
   ``The decision of the Soviet Union to suspend further withdrawals
of its troops is a matter of concern and disappointment,'' Foreign
Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan said in a statement today.
   The suspension and the new Soviet weapons represent ``a violation
of the letter and spirit of the Geneva agreements and are
incompatible with the understanding that the only military activity
to be undertaken by Soviet forces would be in defense of their
withdrawing troops,'' Yaqub Khan said.
   He called the escalation of Soviet military activity a form of
``support of the desparate and isolated Kabul regime.'' Kabul, the
capital of Afghanistan, has recently come under heavy missile
attacks by the guerrillas.
   Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 to replace one
fledgling Marxist government with another.

   A Vietnamese politician predicted
today his country and the United States will normalize relations
next year, clearing the way for foreign investment needed to develop
the war-ravaged communist nation.
   The prediction was made by Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a member of the
Vietnamese Parliament with a doctorate in economics from Harvard. He
arrived in Manila two days ago from a monthlong lecture tour of the
United States.
   Oanh, who also visited France and South Korea, said his U.S.
visit was part of a tour of Western nations to persuade capitalists
to invest in his country.
   The economist, an adviser to the Vietnamese government, was a
deputy prime minister of South Vietnam before the fall of Saigon in
1975 and was jailed for a year after the communists came to power.
   Oanh said progress also was being made in international
negotiations to end his country's 10-year occupation of Cambodia as
well as in efforts to solve the problem of American soldiers still
missing in action after the Vietnam War.
   During his U.S. visit, Oanh met with administration officials and
lawmakers and ``received very encouraging and positive signs'' from
them, he said.

<TEXT>
   Indian and Maldivian military officers
negotiated on the high seas today with foreign mercenaries who fled
the Maldives in a boat with about 18 hostages after failing to
overthrow the government.
   ``We have started talking,'' said Maj. Zahir of the Maldives'
National Security Service. ``We have not yet reached any conclusion.
There are many lives involved. There are threats to life.'' The
major gave only one name.
   The negotiations began after two Indian warships halted the boat
with the mercenaries and their hostages. At sundown today, the talks
were still under way, said A.K. Banerjee, the Indian high
commissioner in Male, the capital.
   Zahir said that out of concern for the hostages' safety soldiers
refrained from boarding the boat, whose location he declined to
reveal. ``We fear that the mercenaries may harm the hostages, so we
want to be cautious,'' he said.
   The mercenaries' boat was intercepted en route to Sri Lanka, said
an Indian general who helped rescue besieged President Maumoon Abdul
Gayoom after the attempted coup Thursday on the Indian Ocean island
nation.
   Maldivian officials and foreign diplomats in Sri Lanka said the
mercenaries were thought to be Sri Lankan Tamil guerrillas. The
general, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the mercenaries'
boat escaped from Male on Friday after Indian paratroopers reached
the Maldivian capital. The Maldives is 500 miles southwest of India
and more than 600 miles west of Sri Lanka.
   Banerjee, whose rank is equivalent to ambassador, said between 27
and 32 people died in the attempted coup. ``This figure may be
understated because the mercenaries may have removed their dead,''
he said.
   He gave no breakdown of the deaths. A short time earlier,
Banerjee and a Maldivian Foreign Ministry official, Ahmed Suleem,
said at least 20 people were killed, including 13 civilians and
seven Maldivian security men.
   Banerjee said the mercenaries, estimated to number about 150,
fled in two boats and one dingy. He said the four who fled in the
dingy surrendered Friday on a neighboring island. One boat carried
mercenaries and the hostages, and the whereabouts of the other boat
was unknown, he said.
   Shops and businesses in the Maldives were closed today after
President Gayoom declared a day of mourning for those killed in the
attempted coup.
   Suleem said there were about 18 hostages aboard the boat halted
by the Indian navy and that the hostages included Transport Minister
Ahmed Mujithaba and his wife. No one could say how many mercenaries
were on the boat.
   A senior Indian air force officer at the south Indian airport at
Trivandrum said the hostages were hustled aboard the 5,000-ton boat
when the gunmen fled through blasts of Indian machine-gun fire on
Friday.
   In Sri Lanka, a spokesman for the biggest Tamil militant group,
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, denied involvement in the
attempted coup.
   The Tigers have been waging a five-year separatist war against
Sri Lanka's Sinhalese-dominated government.
   In the Maldives, Indian troops started a new house-to-house
search operation today for arms and foreign gunmen who may have
failed to escape, said a Male resident reached by telephone from
Colombo, Sri Lanka. The residents were advised by state radio to
stay indoors today.
   The Maldives, population 190,000, gained independence from
Britain in 1965 and became a republic in 1968.

   The South was belted by thunderstorms today after a violent
weather system in Alabama, Mississippi and Florida brought
destructive winds, hail the size of golf balls and numerous
tornadoes that killed at least one person.
   In Alabama, eight tornadoes were spawned Friday night by severe
thunderstorms, mainly in the northern portions of the state. One
tornado in Colbert County caused a truck stop to collapse, and
destroyed or damaged truck trailers.
   The tornado left 12 people injured in or near the truck stop and
a total of 17 people hurt in the county as a result of the violent
weather, authorities said.
   One man was admitted to a hospital but other injuries reported
were minor, officials said.
   ``I went inside the truck stop and lay down on the floor where
everybody else was,'' said Erskine Williams. ``All we could do was
pray.''
   In northeast Alabama, high winds forced workers to evacuate 30 of
52 residents of the Cherokee County Nursing Home, but no injuries
were reported. In Mississippi, thunderstorm winds caused heavy
damage to three homes in southeast Wayne County, where roofs were
blown off and large trees and power lines were downed. A mobile home
was blown off of its blocks near Meridian.
   Athens, Ala., was pelted by golf-ball-sized hail.
   Strong thunderstorms continued to develop over southern Alabama
and northwest Florida.
   In Florida, strong winds near Fort Walton damaged tree limbs and
blew out windows. Winds gusted to 61 mph at Pensacola. Early today,
a tornado touched down in Madison County, killing at least one
person, injuring five and destroying several homes, the sheriff's
department said.
   The Hawaiian Islands were lashed by the first storm of the
season. Heavy rains dumped 4.8 inches of water at Hilo Airport on
the Big Island. Throughout the islands, roads were closed and
boaters ran aground in the high surf. Power and telephone service
was knocked out in some areas.
   There were no reports of major damage or injuries.
   Today's forecast called for widespread rain from the East Coast
across the northern and central Appalachians to the Great Lakes
region; thunderstorms and rain from the eastern Great Lakes across
the central Appalachians to the middle and southern Atlantic Coast;
scattered rain from the middle Mississippi Valley across the lower
Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the southern Appalachians; snow over
western upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin and much of Minnesota;
rain in the Pacific Northwest; and strong winds in the Pacific
Northwest, and from the central Great Plains to the upper and middle
Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 30s and 40s from the
upper Great Lakes across the upper half of the Mississippi Valley to
the middle Missouri Valley; in the 50s over New England and from the
lower Great Lakes across the lower Ohio Valley, the central Plains
and the northern Rockies to Washington; in the 80s to near 90 over
much of Florida, southern Texas and the desert Southwest; and in the
60s or 70s throughout the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 18
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 80 degrees at Key
West, Fla., Naval Air Station.

   The Soviet Union's ambassador in Afghanistan today
said the Geneva agreement leading to the withdrawal of Soviet
soldiers from the war-torn country was near ruin, and he called for
a new international debate on it.
   The statement by Yuli Vorontsov to Afghan legislators came one
day after Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh said
the Soviet Union had stopped withdrawing its soldiers because of
unrelenting pressure from rebels.
   Bessmertnykh also said Moscow sent advanced weapons to
Afghanistan, an apparent reference to MiG-27 jets and SS-1 Scud
missiles spotted there.
   The moves appeared designed to increase pressure on anti-Marxist
Afghan guerrillas who have stepped up their attacks since the
Soviets began withdrawing May 15, and on their backers _ the United
States and Pakistan.
   Pakistan today condemned the Soviet moves, saying they violate
the Geneva accords and raise doubts about Moscow's commitment to end
the war.
   Vorontsov told a group of Afghan legislators that the supply of
modern weaponry to the guerrillas by the United States and Pakistan
``is a very serious blow to the Geneva accords, which practically
torpedoes them.''
   ``The time has come for a new international debate of all aspects
of the situation in Afghanistan and around it, because foreign
powers _ Pakistan and the United States _ are involved here,'' the
official Soviet news agency Tass quoted Vorontsov as saying in Kabul.
   Vorontsov said the United Nations, which helped negotiate the
April 14 Geneva agreement, could help straighten out the situation.
   Bessmertnykh said the Soviet Union still is committed to
completing its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by Feb. 15. But he
added that Soviet compliance with the Geneva accords also depended
on whether the other signers obeyed it as well, indicating that the
Soviets may be considering keeping soldiers in the country after the
deadline.
   Vorontsov did not address that issue and did not say what kind of
an international debate the Soviet Union wants on Afghanistan.
   Soviet newspapers published this morning did not carry
Bessmertnykh's announcement that the Soviet Union was halting its
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   In a statement from Islamabad, Pakistan's foreign minister,
Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, said the suspension and the indroduction of
new Soviet weapons ``are incompatible with the understanding that
the only military activity to be undertaken by Soviet forces would
be in defense of their withdrawing troops.''
   More than 13,000 Soviet soldiers have died in Afghanistan and the
war has become increasingly unpopular in the Soviet Union. Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev calls the war a ``bleeding wound,''
and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Andrei Sakharov says it is ``one of the
greatest tragedies of our times.''
   But Bessmertnykh's statement showed deepening Soviet frustration
with how forces of Afghanistan President Najib's pro-Soviet
government are faring against the insurgents since the Soviet
withdrawal began.
   In September, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnaze said the
Soviets had finished the first part of a pullout set to end Feb. 15,
but had not begun the second phase, saying it depended on whether
violations of the accords cease.
   U.N. observers have said half the Soviet troops withdrew by Aug.
15, so Shevardnadze's statement meant the Red Army retreat stopped
since then. The withdrawal began May 15.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of protesters
screaming for the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan on
corruption charges battled riot police and demonstrated today in
eight South Korean cities.
   At least 11 officers were injured, including 10 when a police
station in Seoul was firebombed, authorities said.
   Witnesses said dozens of protesters were injured but police
provided no details. Tear gas was used to break up demonstrations in
all eight cities.
   Fierce fighting broke out in the Seoul, the capital, when riot
police stopped 10,000 dissidents and students trying to march to
Chun's house after an anti-Chun rally at a downtown park.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!'' demonstrators shouted as they charged
riot police with rocks, bricks and clubs. Police fired barrages of
tear gas and chased protesters into sidestreets and alleys.
   The number of protesters swelled to more than 15,000 at one
crowded shopping district, and clashes continued several hours after
nightfall.
   Protesters burned effigies of Chun, President Roh Tae-woo and
Uncle Sam. Some shouted slogans demanding the withdrawal of the
42,000 U.S. forces in South Korea. Others demanded the overthrow of
Roh, claiming his government is a front for military rule.
   Police martial arts squads charged protesters into sidestreets,
beating and kicking, but the protesters regrouped and occupied
several other boulevards.
   A police officer was injured seriously on the southern outskirts
of Seoul when students brandishing firebombs and iron bars attacked
an office of the governing political party.
   Police said 10 other officers were injured when a three-story
police station was firebombed in another section of Seoul.
   Dissidents and radical students had called for nationwide rallies
today to demand the arrest and punishment of Chun for alleged
corruption and violations of human rights during his seven-year
tenure, which ended in February.
   Police reported firing tear gas to thwart anti-Chun rallies in
seven other cities _ Cheju, Chunchon, Kwangju, Pusan, Taegu, Taejon
and Wonju.
   In Pusan, an opposition stronghold south of Seoul, fighting began
late today when police fired tear gas at thousands of protesters
trying to burn an effigy of Chun after a street march, the South
Korean news agency said.
   In Kwangju, police said hundreds of students armed with firebombs
and rocks attacked a government prosecutors' building, burned two
police buses and damaged eight cars. Dozens of windows were smashed.
   At least one student was injured when he fell off a third-floor
window to the ground, and eight students were arrested for seizing
the prosecutors' building, police said.
   During the Seoul rally today, dissident leaders called for bigger
rallies next week and vowed to attack Chun's house.
   As part of their anti-government campaign, radical students have
attacked government buildings and offices of the governing
Democratic Justice Party since riot police thwarted a march Thursday
by thousands of students hurling rocks and firebombs.
   Opposition parties today turned down a governing party proposal
that Chun apologize or respond to allegations of corruption during
his tenure. The three major opposition groups are moving to subpoena
the ex-president to testify in a parliamentary investigation, but
the governing party objects to the move.
   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was recently sentenced
to seven years' in prison for taking bribes and misusing millions of
dollars in government money while he headed a rural development
program.
   Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980, also is being
investigated for his alleged role in putting down a 1980 civil
uprising in Kwangju. By official count, about 200 people died in the
military suppression of the nine-day uprising.

   A mixed-race man who claimed he
was wrongly arrested and tortured by police has received $5,000 from
authorities in an out-of-court settlement, the South African Press
Association said today.
   Trevor Williams said he was arrested June 3, 1987, after he went
to police and told them he had been robbed while driving his
delivery truck, the news agency said.
   Williams, of Mitchells Plain outside Cape Town, said police then
began questioning him. The dispatch did not indicate what the
alleged interrogation concerned.
   He said his hands were handcuffed behind his back, and he was
told to lie on the floor, the news agency said. Police placed a
canvas bag over Williams' head and poured water into the bag, the
agency quoted him as saying.
   Williams said he eventually passed out, the news agency reported.
   A statement issued on behalf of Minister of Law and Order Adriaan
Vlok said the settlement was made ``without any admission of
(police) liability.''

   The campaigns of Republican George Bush and
Democrat Michael Dukakis ushered in the final few days of the
contest with a flurry of new ads, including the debut of two appeals
from Bush and a Dukakis attack ad on drugs.
   The candidates were spending millions on television in key states
such as California, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York
and Illinois, in addition to network slots during the final four-day
push.
   Bush also arranged a $1.3 million advertising drive on ABC and
CBS from Friday through Monday, with five primetime slots on each
network and another during Saturday afternoon sports events on each
network.
   Dukakis planned to repeat a five-minute, populist-flavored
message originally broadcast Tuesday on NBC. It will be rebroadcast
Saturday at 10:55 p.m. EST on NBC and ABC. Cost of the time: about
$375,000 for both slots.
   In addition, each candidate has paid nearly $1 million to buy a
half-hour on all three networks on Election Eve. Dukakis will make
his final appeal at 8 p.m. EST followed by Bush at 8:30 p.m.
   And they were taking advantage of another round of appearances on
news and interview programs. Both candidates were interviewed Friday
on ABC's World News Tonight and by David Frost for an hour-long
syndicated show airing Saturday and Sunday. Dukakis also was
scheduled to be on an NBC News campaign special Sunday night.
   One of the new Bush ads shows the vice president talking into the
camera asking voters to look at his and Dukakis' records ``because
this campaign is about very real differences, very real hopes, very
real dreams.''
   ``My vision is a growing and strong America, with low taxes, a
strong national defense and tough laws to fight crime,'' Bush says.
``My mission is to keep building a better America, an America that
remains second to none.''
   The other spot is set to the song ``God Bless the USA'' sung by
Lee Greenwood. The lyrics include lines such as, ``I'm proud to be
an American where at least I know I'm free... 'cause there ain't no
doubt I love this land _ God bless the USA.''
   The lyrics are intercut with narration to the effect that Bush is
the only candidate qualified to be ``the next leader of the free
world.'' The ad is set to images of Bush on the campaign trail, with
children, with Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev and with British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The new Dukakis ad, a variation on several he has released on the
drug theme, attacks Bush's plan to make his running mate, Indiana
Sen. Dan Quayle, the nation's drug czar.
   ``First he said he'd put Dan Quayle in charge,'' a narrator says.
``Now he refuses to cut off aid to countries that allow drug
traffic. Mike Dukakis thinks he's dead wrong.''
   The scene shifts to a large rally, where Dukakis is saying, ``If
you're against us, don't expect a dime of American foreign aid. ...
I'll work with other countries but I'll be damned if I let those
countries send their poison into the United States of America.''
   In Texas, meanwhile, Democrats began running a radio ad to
counter Republican-sponsored, Spanish-language radio spots carrying
two warnings that ``voting officials will be watching closely'' on
Election Day to make sure non-citizens do not vote and voters do not
accept money.
   The Democratic spot, running on 36 stations throughout Texas,
features a husband and wife wondering whether the GOP is trying to
intimidate them and saying they will vote Democratic ``without fear
and with lots of pride.''
   The GOP ad is sponsored by the Hidalgo County Republican Party
and has been disavowed by the Republican National Committee. The
Justice Department is investigating the spot.

   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq today met
for the third time since U.N.-mediated peace talks resumed six days
ago.
   Neither minister made any comment before entering the session,
mediated by by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The ministers last met Wednesday. Since then, technical experts
from each side have held one meeting, and Perez de Cuellar met
separately once with the two foreign ministers, Ali Akbar Velayati
of Iran and Iraq's Tariq Aziz.
   Perez de Cuellar announced he would leave Geneva tonight for
Paris and return Sunday to New York. His special representative, Jan
Eliasson of Sweden, was to take over for him in Geneva.
   The talks are aimed at implementing U.N. Security Council
Resolution 598, which outlines the terms for a cease-fire and peace
in the region after their 8-year-old war. The talks began in Geneva
Aug. 25, five days after a cease-fire went into effect. A second
round of talks was held in New York last month.
   Questions that need to be resolved include troop withdrawal,
delineation of the common border and exchanging an estimated 100,000
prisoners of war.

<HEAD>President Appoints New Premier To Form Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid appointed a
premier today and asked him to form a new government to begin
solving the country's economic crisis, the Algerian news agency
reported.
   The appointment of Health Minister Kasdi Merbah to the post came
two days after Algerians overwhelmingly approved changes to the
constitution that grant the premier new powers.
   Another provision of the reform, approved by 92 percent of the
voters in Thursday's referendum, is aimed at separating the ruling
National Liberation Front, the only legal political party, from the
day-to-day running of the government.
   Algerians took to the streets last month to protest a declining
standard of living, food shortages and a lack of jobs. By official
count, the riots left 176 people dead when troops fired into crowds
that failed to disperse.
   The rioting ended when Bendjedid promised political and economic
reforms, begining with the referendum and the naming of a new
government.
   Merbah, 50, replaces Brahim Brahimi, whom the official news
agency, Algerie Presse Service, did not mention in its dispatch.
   The new premier has served under Bendjedid as minister of
agriculture, and for the past 10 months as minister of health.
   Merbah oversaw the conversion of many enormous state farms into
small, private collectives _ a change regarded by Western economists
as one of Algeria's more successful attempts at making the economy
more productive and efficient. ``He is known as a can-do guy,'' said
one Western diplomat.
   It was not immediately known when the rest of the new government
would be named. It faces the immense challenge of pulling Algeria
out of a crisis brought on by the plummeting price of oil, which
represents 97 percent of the country's export earnings.

<HEAD>Driver Fired For Letting Passenger Take Over Bus After Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bus driver whose vehicle was
commandeered by a passenger who accepted his challenge to ``drive
this better than I can'' has been fired, transit officials said.
   Kim Dale Miller, 36, was dismissed Friday, a day after his case
was heard by an Orange County Transit District committee, said
transit district spokeswoman Claudia Keith.
   The driver was dismissed for berating a passenger and leaving a
bus unattended, Ms. Keith said.
   Miller could not immediately be reached for comment. His phone
number was not listed in the Anaheim directory.
   He had not driven for the district since Oct. 19 when witnesses
said he stepped off his bus after challenging passenger James G.
Biddle to do a better job than him.
   Biddle, a 52-year-old Buena Park engineer, said the dare came
after he complained about the driver's berating a passenger for not
giving him the proper bus fare.
   He also said he chided Miller about his driving, complaining that
his sudden starts and stops were throwing people back and forth in
their seats.
   At that point, Biddle said, Miller told him, ``I suppose you
think you can drive this better than I can.''
   When Biddle said he could, Miller got off the bus and stood on a
street corner with his arms folded. He was left there when Biddle
put the bus in gear and pulled away.
   He carried the vehicle's 31 passengers more than mile, stopping
to let people off and on, before police pulled him over. Other
passengers said later that Biddle made change, gave them transfer
tickets and was courteous.
   Biddle was cited for joy riding and operating the vehicle without
a bus-driver's license. He is scheduled to appear in Municipal Court
on Monday and faces a maximum of $400 in fines and three months in
jail.

election campaign is viewed abroad.

presidential race:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JAPAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Japan Times (English-language, independent) of Tokyo: ``With
only a few days left before the U.S. presidential election next
Tuesday, we cannot help but ask ourselves: What does this election
mean for Japan?
   ``A `black and white' view of the election might suggest that
Vice President George Bush represents continuity whereas Gov.
Michael Dukakis stands for change. Mr. Bush supports free trade
whereas Gov. Dukakis seems to be leaning toward protectionism. Mr.
Bush defends the free market whereas Gov. Dukakis supports
government intervention. And yet the distinctions between these two
men are not at all so clear.
   ``Either of them will be likely to emphasize Japan-U.S. relations
as a central element in their foreign policy. ...
   ``On trade, Mr. Bush has vowed to uphold the Reagan
administration's devotion to free trade in principle, if not always
in practice. ... Gov. Dukakis has been transformed in a few short
months from the free trader among the Democratic contenders to a
protectionist in comparison with Mr. Bush. ...
   ``On the economy, Mr. Bush adheres to the laissez-faire
principles of the Reagan era. Gov. Dukakis, meanwhile, proposes an
`economic development strategy' which at times follows closely on
the model of Japanese industrial policy. ...
   ``Paradoxically, perhaps, a revival of U.S. competitiveness would
serve Japan's best interests in the long run. If the U.S. industrial
erosion continues, no American leader will be able to fight off the
forces of protectionism. If the U.S. economy resurges, however, this
could provide an important engine for growth in Japan.
   ``If Mr. Bush wins, as the polls indicate he will, we can only
hope that he will be magnanimous enough in victory to learn some
lessons from his opponent as from his predecessor.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Times of London (independent): ``The suspicion that the
country may have lost some of its freedom of maneuver through
careless expansion of the budget deficit has encouraged the drift
towards economic jingoism.
   ``This has been more pronounced in the case of Gov. Dukakis and
Sen. Bentsen, who cheerfully reneged on earlier free trade
convictions, but Vice President Bush's recent lunge at Japan was
also depressing. ...
   ``Mr. Bush's promise to balance the budget by 1993 ... is .. .
not credible. He promises to do so through a `flexible freeze' of
spending, without raising taxes. ... Mr. Dukakis' recipes seem
equally implausible: economic growth, some spending cuts, lower
interest rates and efforts to collect unpaid taxes. ...
   ``Whoever wins on Tuesday, the European Community and Japan .. .
will have to reckon with the deficits as an international problem
which the incoming administration is powerless to tackle without
their cooperation. This means that Western Europe must do nothing to
fuel protectionism on the other side of the Atlantic. ...
   ``The European Community could make a start ... by offering
clear, timetabled commitments to roll back agricultural
protectionism. It is economically in Western Europe's interest. This
campaign has also made it clear that it is also a political
imperative. The next U.S. president will need to enter the White
House in January bearing gifts from America's friends.''

<HEAD>NORWAY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Aftenposten (conservative) of Olso: ``The two main candidates
have appeared as ``doublehumans.'' George Bush, the favorite, has
carried out a tactless and dirty election campaign with parts of the
struggle taking place in the gutters, while sometimes talking about
creating a more friendly and kinder nation. Michael Dukakis has
mostly been a gray, steady and uninspiring candidate, but has
occasionally shown proof of being witty, aggressive and a committed
person with human warmth. The voters cannot know what type of
personality they will get in the White House when Ronald Reagan
leaves.''
   _Verdens Gang (independent) of Oslo: ``In three days the
superpower U.S.A. will elect a president not really wanted by the
large majority of the American people. Regardless of the outcome:
It's frightening that so many Republicans and Democrats seem to feel
that none of the candidates deserves to win. Both have been so busy
with hitting under the belt that even the most callous bystanders
think the play has been too rough.''
   _Ny Tid (Socialist Left Party's weekly) of Oslo: ``Regardless of
who wins ... the new president will have the support of only one
fourth of the American people. Regardless of who wins, the United
States will not get a social democratic president. The most recent
public opinion polls indicate that Bush will be the next president.
That does not promise well, especially not for the United States.''
   _Klassekampen (daily newspaper of the Workers' Communist Party)
of Oslo: ``On Tuesday Michael Dukakis will lose the U.S.
presidential election. Bush's negative campaign against Dukakis has
succeeded. Agressive and deliberately untruthful attacks on Dukakis
have been repeated ... in Bush's television ads. The campaign has
not concentrated on the classical slogan `How to sell a President,'
but instead on `How to create a Loser'.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MEXICO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _La Jornada (leftist) of Mexico City: ``Dukakis made some
statements on Central America that, without breaking new ground, at
least reaffirmed that in a Dukakis White House there'd be a change
in policy towards Latin America, and especially in the focus on the
Central American drama.
   ``Unfortunately, most Americans are not very interested in the
subject; for them the most important issues are fiscal policy, the
death penalty and drug trafficking.

   _Ya (Roman Catholic) of Madrid: `` ... although the protagonist
of the `Reagan Era' obviously has been Reagan, some of its legacy
must correspond to his vice president, Bush, who offers above all
the calming banner of continuity.
   ``What can Dukakis offer to confront this? The commentators,
above all those outside the USA, have concentrated on his qualities
as a brilliant, intuitive man along Kennedyesque intellectual lines.
But they have forgotten that these qualities, fascinating to
Europeans, are not irresistable to American voters who mainly look
to their government leaders for security, efficacy and consistency,
qualities Bush has in good supply. In addition, Dukakis is no
Kennedy.''

   The former Swiss boxing champion, Walter Blaser,
stabbed his wife to death in the cafe where she worked, then
committed suicide with the same knife, police said Saturday.
   Blaser, 41, killed his 29-year-old wife Marie-Luce on Friday
night, according to police, who gave no motive for the boxer's
action. The couple had been married six months.
   Blaser was held under investigative custody from January to June
after he injured a policeman, who he alleged was trying to harm his
future wife, Swiss newspapers reported Saturday. They said the
couple was married in May, while Blaser was in jail.
   Blaser was the Swiss featherweight champion from 1972 until he
retired in 1975 after losing the European championship match to Jose
Ramon Gomez Fouz of Spain.
   During his six-year career, he won 27 of his 29 bouts, scoring
knockouts in 15 of them.

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although they are U.S. citizens,
Puerto Ricans cannot vote for president on Election Day. But the
next occupant of the White House could help determine whether this
Caribbean island remains a U.S. commonwealth or becomes the 51st
state.
   The Republican candidate, Vice President George Bush, has aligned
himself with the pro-statehood party. Democrat Michael Dukakis is
for commonwealth.
   The Spanish-speaking island of 3.3 million people 1,000 miles
southeast of Florida has been a U.S. commonwealth for 36 years.
   Although it has nearly as much control over its affairs as the 50
states, Puerto Rico is not a state. It is not a colony either,
although some say it comes close. A small but vocal minority favors
independence.
   All three main parties _ Popular Democratic, Independence and New
Progressive _ want the relationship with the United States to
change. They are putting up candidates for governor, legislators,
mayors and one non-voting U.S. Congressional delegate.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, the pro-commonwealth candidate, is
seeking a third term and in polls has maintained a comfortable lead
over his chief rival, San Juan Mayor Baltasar Corrada del Rio, who
favors statehood.
   Hernandez Colon wants strong U.S. ties but more autonomy. Dukakis
is his man.
   ``I am a Dukakis supporter and Dukakis supports me,'' he said in
an interview with The Associated Press. ``The statehood party is
with George Bush and the Republicans deny Puerto Rico any change.''
   For example, Hernandez Colon was not pleased when Secretary of
State George Shultz turned down a request in 1986 to seek a treaty
with Japan to give Japanese firms tax breaks in the island.
   Hernandez Colon, first elected in 1972 and re-elected in 1984,
wants more leeway in economic, foreign trade and immigration issues.
   His Popular Democratic Party runs under the slogan ``bread, land
and liberty,'' implying Puerto Rico has its cake and eats it too.
   ``We have the best of both worlds,'' said law professor Marcos
Ramirez. ``Puerto Rican people don't want the U.S. to get out, but
they also don't want them to rule the country.''
   As U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans are eligible for U.S. military
service and welfare benefits. But they don't pay federal taxes and
can't vote for president.
   The island received $6.5 billion in U.S. aid this year, and with
tax exemptions for American companies, it has Caribbean's strongest
economy.
   Hernandez Colon's campaign focuses on economic gains. He cites a
drop of 14 percent in the unemployment rate, which was more than 23
percent in 1985 when he took office. Economic growth has been 5
percent over the same period, according to government figures.
   Corrada del Rio says the governor should thank the United States
for the strong economy.
   ``If the economy has grown, the credit belongs to President
Reagan, not to you,'' he said in a television debate.
   His New Progressive Party, whose slogan is ``statehood, security,
progress,'' says a statehood advantage would be to vote in U.S.
elections.
   ``It's a sovereignty issue,'' said the party's Sen. Oreste Ramos.
``We are governed by people we can't vote for. And we want to
participate in that process.''
   The Independence Party's gubernatorial candidate, Ruben Berrios
Martinez, a Harvard-educated law professor, says Puerto Rico is
grossly overdependent on the United States.
   ``Chickens! We import chickens!'' he said. ``We're not capable of
raising our own?''
   Berrios' party hasn't won more than 6 percent of the vote in 20
years.
   All candidates have promised a referendum on the status issue
after the election. But Hernandez Colon said he wants beforehand a
U.S. pledge to honor the outcome.
   In the last referendum in 1967, 60 percent wanted commonwealth to
continue, 39 percent preferred statehood and 1 percent supported
independence.
   Whatever this election's outcome, Puerto Rico's status is not
likely to change soon. Congress would have to approve any proposal.
   Still, if Corrada del Rio's statehood party wins and so does
Bush, the chances of Puerto Rico becoming a state would be enhanced.
   And what if the polls are right and Bush and Hernandez Colon both
win?
   ``I can work with the Republican administration,'' the governor
said. ``It's just in relation to our status that the Republicans
don't cooperate.''

<TEXT>
   Israel's election failed to produce a clear
statement on how Israelis want to approach peace with the Arabs and
on the future of the occupied territories.
   The balloting for Parliament seats was seen as a referendum on
the peace issue after 11 months of a Palestinian uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But results indicate Israelis
remain deeply divided on the issues.
   Shlomo Avineri, a political scientist at Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, said about 30 percent of Israelis want to annex occupied
land, while another third prefer territorial compromise.
   ``The people in the middle found an easy option, voting for
ethnic or religious parties, but not coming down on the major issue
of peace,'' said Avineri.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc will likely lead the
next government, probably by forming a coalition with small
right-wing parties and Orthodox religious factions. But the
electorate did not give Shamir a mandate for introducing hard-line
policies.
   Shamir is committed to expanding Jewish settlements, but he was
quick to assure voters he would not go along with right-wing calls
to annex the West Bank and Gaza Strip or expel its 1.5 million
Palestinian residents.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the leftist Labor Party,
failed to convince voters there was a reliable Arab partner for
peace.
   Peres had argued that Israel should accept Arab demands for an
international conference because it was the only way to get Jordan's
King Hussein into the process as a stand-in for the PLO.
   But Hussein appeared to vacillate, reinforcing a widely held
belief in Israel that he lacked the courage of the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat, who came to Jerusalem to make peace.
   Hussein announced July 31 that he was cutting ties with the
Palestinians and the occupied lands. Then in the final days of the
campaign he signaled he had changed his mind. He met with PLO Chief
Yasser Arafat and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and gave a belated
endorsement to Peres' plan as a ``step forward.''
   At the same time, Arafat's supporters let it be know the
Palestine National Council was planning a declaration of Palestinian
independence, reinforcing right-wing alarms that Peres' approach
would lead to creation of a Palestinian state.
   ``What the organization (PLO) had somehow neglected to do was to
offer any convincing proof that it was itself a legitimate partner
to peace talks,'' said the pro-Labor Jerusalem Post.
   The final blow for the credibility of Arab intentions came in
firebombings in the final days of the campaign. An Israeli woman and
her three children burned to death last Sunday and a Likud supporter
was seriously hurt as voting was under way Tuesday.
   ``Israelis go to the right when fears for security go up,'' said
Jay Rothman of the independent Leonard Davis Institute for
International Relations.
   He said Israelis feared that in an international conference,
other countries would gang up and demand concessions that would
threaten the nation's security.
   Moderate Palestinians, however, were equally disappointed in the
Israelis for failing to give a mandate to negotiations.
   ``In the past, Israelis complained that they lacked a partner for
peace. Now, it's the Arabs who cannot find a partner in Israel,''
said Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab.
   Some Palestinians, like Nablus businessman Said Kenaan, predicted
Palestinians would react by stepping up violence in the occupied
lands. More than 300 Arabs, and 10 Israelis, have died since the
uprising began Dec. 8.
   ``It's obvious Israelis don't want peace, but we will hit back,''
said Kenaan.
   In meetings with small right-wing parties, Shamir refused
extremist demands for annexation of the occupied land and the
expulsion of Arabs.
   ``Shamir clarified that the idea of transfer (of Arabs) will not
be included in the guidelines of the next government. The concept is
rejected by the Likud,'' said Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.
   Shamir pledged to support new Jewish settlements in occupied
areas, but Ahimeir noted the effort would be constrained by the
amount of money available.

   The government said Saturday it will fine and
close the growing number of factories that illegally employ
children, the official China Daily reported.
   Factories that hire workers under the age of 16 face fines of
$810 to $1,350 per child and will have their licenses revoked if
they continue to defy the labor laws, the report said.
   It quoted a Labor Ministry official as saying child labor is
particularly prevalent in economically booming areas.
   In some rural factories, 20 percent of the workers are children,
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In August, coastal Guangdong province banned the recruitment of
child laborers after news reports said more than 1,000 children were
working in factories in the city of Shenzhen.
   Many of the factories using cheap child labor are foreign joint
ventures or foreign-funded firms, the reports said.
   The government said all private enterprises and individuals
wishing to recruit workers have to sign contracts with the employees
that must be approved by labor authorities.
   Schools have been asked to tighten controls over dropouts, and
parents who force children under 16 to work will be liable to fines
and punishment, the report said.

   ``Well, what do we do now?'' George Bush asked
Ronald Reagan the morning after they were elected eight years ago.
Either Bush or Michael Dukakis will face that question come
Wednesday, and the answer is not as evident now as it was in 1980.
   The long campaign between Republican Bush and Democrat Dukakis
has been filled with political symbols, such as the flag and the
Pledge of Allegiance, but short on specifics about what either
candidate actually would do in the White House.
   There have been no overriding issues, such as a faltering economy
or a threat to peace that have compelled Bush or Dukakis to come
forward with bold ideas. For example, neither candidate has been
willing to offer a concrete program for shrinking the huge budget
deficit.
   Reagan's election was viewed as a mandate for a change in course
from the Carter administration. He pledged to cut taxes, build up
the Pentagon and cut down the government.
   Bush, ahead in the polls a few days before the election, promises
to stay the course set by Reagan. ``When you have to change horses
in midstream, doesn't it make sense to switch to the one who's going
the same way?'' Bush asked.
   On the other hand, if Dukakis managed an upset, there would be a
major upheaval in policy and personnel. ``The best America is yet to
come,'' he promises. But again, few specifics.
   With the now familiar invitation to ``read my lips,'' Bush says
he will not raise taxes and, indeed, will try to cut capital gains
taxes. He says he will oppose new spending by Congress and
personally negotiate with lawmakers for a ``flexible freeze'' on the
budget.
   He promises to keep America's military strong, pressing ahead
with research and eventual development of the Star Wars missile
defense shield, while at the same time seeking progress with the
Soviet Union. And he says he will clean up the environment and
strive to improve education.
   Bush also promises more money for child care, including a toddler
tax credit of up to $1,000 per child under age 4 for poor families.
   He has proposed no less than five summits, including an early
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to ``size each other up
correctly.''
   Bush has pledged to convene a NATO summit ``as one of my first
acts as president.'' He says there will be a global conference on
the environment at the White House within the first year in office
and a summit of Western hemisphere nations to chart strategy for a
war against drugs.
   Moreover, Bush says he will ``meet with all the governors to
discuss the most urgent problems facing our nation's schools.''
   In addition, each year the president of the United States meets
with the leaders of the six other richest nations in the world at an
economic summit. Bush says he will make agriculture the top item on
the agenda.
   Dukakis promises a crackdown on tax cheats who he says beat the
Treasury out of $110 billion a year. He says he'll hire more tax
inspectors _ which Bush seized on as a promise that Dukakis would
put an IRS agent in every kitchen.
   On taxes, Dukakis says no responsible candidate can rule out the
possibility of new taxes, but that he'd ask an increase only as a
last resort.
   To fight drugs, Dukakis said he would double the number of agents
at the Drug Enforcement Agency within five years and hire 800 more
federal prosecutors to handle drug cases.
   He says he will wipe out the trade deficit in four years and put
the country on the course toward a balanced budget.
   On defense, he calls Star Wars a fantasy but still would put $1
billion in the budget for it, about 25 percent of what it gets now.
Dukakis promises to find a ``sensible, affordable'' way to modernize
the land-based nuclear missile arsenal but opposes the MX missile.
   Dukakis also would scrap two planned aircraft carrier task
forces, but said he would bolster military readiness with a
``conventional defense initiative.'' He says he would lay out the
prospect of better economic ties to the Soviet Union as a way of
achieving concessions on arms control, human rights and other
superpower problems.
   Under Dukakis, the Environmental Protection Agency would become a
Cabinet agency.
   Dukakis would seek legislation to require employers to provide
health insurance to all employees. He also proposes to raise the
minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to at least $4.55.
   While a Dukakis administration would bring a wholesale turnover
in government managers, Bush would be expected to keep at least
several of Reagan's Cabinet officers, including possibly Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   Former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, now Bush's campaign
chairman, is a likely bet for secretary of state in a Bush
administration.

   Rare furniture designed by architect
Frank Lloyd Wright will return to its original home in Springfield
following efforts by Gov. James R. Thompson and more than $800,000
in donations.
   Thompson said Friday he has negotiated deals for the state-owned
Dana-Thomas House museum to buy the furniture, a $704,000 double
pedestal table lamp, a $20,000 drafting table and four dining room
chairs costing $120,000.
   ``There are only a few major pieces from the Dana home that are
still privately owned, so the opportunities to purchase them, either
at auction or by private sale agreements, are extremely rare,''
Thompson said.
   Experts describe the Dana-Thomas house, built by Wright for
$60,000 around 1903, as one of the finest examples of the
architect's Prairie School houses open to the public.
   The house, commissioned by Susan Lawrence Dana and now maintained
by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, is one of the most
completely furnished of all Wright's buildings.
   The lamp was purchased by the Dana-Thomas House Foundation
through a direct sale arranged without fee by Christie's auction
house in New York, Thompson said, noting that it is scheduled to
arrive upon final payment next June.
   ``Considering the near-hysteria surrounding the acquisition of
authentic Wright pieces and the rapidly escalating prices being
offered by collectors, we were pleased that Christie's agreed to the
private sale of this rare lamp,'' he said.
   The chairs were bought from a Colorado family and were returned
to the Dana House in September. The drafting table will be bought
from a private owner through Christie's.

   George Bush said today he will continue
campaigning hard against the Democrats, who he said ``thought they
were going to kick my brains out and get away with it'' at their
Atlanta convention.
   ``They can dish it out but they can't take it,'' he told campaign
workers at Republican headquarters, before setting out on a
door-to-door get-out-the-vote tour.
   In answer to reports that he was tiring and cutting back, the
vice president promised that the day would be ``one of the darndest
days we've ever seen so that everybody will be exhausted.''
   His campaign schedule, however, was being altered. A rally in
Colorado Springs tonight was rescheduled for Sunday morning,
replacing a Fresno, Calif., event.
   A CBS poll showed his race with Michael Dukakis tightening but
Bush said ``I don't believe those polls.''
   And finally, he told reporters, ``Do I feel I've got a good shot
at winning? Absolutely.''
   In Livonia, Mich., Friday night, with his wife Barbara and
daughter Dorothy at his side, Bush said ``You're looking at three
tired people here.''
   Bush's campaign strategists were changing his schedule several
times a day as they figured which battleground states to send him
into.
   ``They're making strategic decisions based on a whole lot of
last-minute data including polling, local pressures and the ability
to checkmate our opponent,'' press secretary Sheila Tate said.
   The idea is to use the last three days of the campaign ``trying
to make inroads, not let him get any momentum'' and make it
impossible for Dukakis to win the states his campaign says it is
counting on to garner the 270 electoral votes needed for victory.
   Bush's schedule changes were coming on such short notice that the
Secret Service was doing only a fraction of the advance work that
normally begins several days before a visit to any city.
   Today's swing included New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois and
Colorado.
   On Friday, Bush was in Michigan for the second time in a week, as
a poll published in the Detroit News showed Dukakis had pulled
within four percentage points of him statewide.
   Bush planned to be back again in Michigan on Sunday night, after
a day trip to California.
   Earlier Friday, in an interview with The Associated Press, Bush
said he was satisfied with the conduct of a presidential campaign
some have labeled one of the most negative in recent history.
   ``The idea that this campaign is so different from others _ I
don't believe it. I don't think the American people believe it, all
this stuff about being turned off. You can always go out and find
people to say that,'' he said.
   He also expressed dismay that a consulting firm headed by his
longtime associate Frederick M. Bush (no relation) had sought
business with the Haitian government by touting the firm's ties to
the vice president.
   ``I denounce it, I don't like it, I think it's wrong,'' Bush said.
   Frederick Bush said the intiative in his name was done without
his approval by his partner, Michael Govan.
   Asked how Frederick Bush, deputy fundraising director of Bush's
primary election campaign and now a Republican National Committee
consultant, could have allowed it to happen, George Bush said: ``Ask
him how he could allow it to happen.''
   Bush said the lobbying episode does not indicate what would
happen in a Bush administration, because, ``I've been in public life
for 20 years, and no one has ever made any allegations about
impropriety on my part because they know how strongly I feel about
ethics in government.''
   The vice president, interviewed on his plane between events in
Connecticut and Ohio, dismissed suggestions that his campaign was
easing off in anticipation of victory, as his weekend schedule
filled up to bolster his argument.
   ``We can't do any more, we just can't,'' Bush said.
   Also in the AP interview, Bush suggested working toward a free
trade pact with Mexico similar to the one recently negotiated with
Canada. He said he opposes such an arrangement at this time with
Japan.

<TEXT>
   The morning of Nov. 10, 1938, Fritz
Kleinmann saw synagogues aflame. By afternoon, the 15-year-old boy
and his father had been arrested and beaten by Nazis. Within months,
Fritz, his father and thousands of other Austrian Jews were deported
to the Buchenwald concentration camp.
   In April 1945, Kleinmann was freed from the dreaded Mauthausen,
the third death camp in his ghoulish odyssey through Nazi terror. He
weighed just 77 pounds.
   Today, Kleinmann, 65, a slender, quick-witted man, sits in his
apartment in a nondescript tenement bloc in suburban Vienna and
recalls how his terror began on the night now called Kristallnacht:
   ``In the morning of Nov. 10, we saw two synagogues burning in the
Leopoldstadt (then a largely Jewish district of Vienna). Then we
waited for the knock on the door.
   ``In the afternoon I was arrested. So was my father. After I was
maltreated at police headquarters ... I was allowed to go home
because I was only 15.''
   A day later, police released Kleinmann's father, who two decades
earlier had been seriously wounded and decorated as a soldier in the
Austro-Hungarian army.
   Those World War I decorations did not impress the Nazis when
Kleinmann and many of his family were deported the next year.
   ``Half of my family were gassed, including one sister and my
mother,'' Kleinmann said. Another sister and a younger brother
escaped and ended up in the United States, where they still live.
   ``They burned synagogues and other places of worship. It was
terrible ... howling people were standing by,'' screaming
anti-Semitic slogans, Kleinman recalled.
   ``The firefighters arrived all right, but they were under orders
not to extinguish the synagogue fires. They protected nearby
buildings from catching fire until the Jewish temples were burned
out.''
   Speaking the broad German dialect of the Viennese working class,
Kleimann said the officially endorsed pogrom was a welcome
opportunity for many Viennese to vent their anti-Semitism. They
looted and stole from Jews, humiliated and mistreated them.
   ``The terrible thing was that our neighbors, my friends, my
father's friends, were among those beating us, vilifying us,
spitting at us. Young people who had been my playmates were suddenly
Nazis who turned against us,'' he said.
   Unlike in Germany, the Nazis in Vienna, then home to some 200,000
Jews, did not wait for Kristallnacht to start burning and
ransacking. Existing Nazi documents and data in Vienna's fire
department show numerous Jewish temples were devastated in October
that year.
   On Oct. 16, firemen were called to extinguish a fire involving
the Community Temple, records show.
   According to a report on Kristallnacht by Austrian Jews, some
7,800 people were arrested and an unknown number killed in Vienna
alone. The detained were taken to so-called collection camps and
brutally treated, while 4,083 Vienna shops were plundered, the
report found.
   Some 680 people, many of them Jews, committed suicide on Nov.10
and subsequent days, said the report by intellectuals, camp
survivors and members of the Jewish community.
   Many synagogues, some of them local landmarks, were completely
gutted, with mobs throwing hand grenades to set them ablaze.
   It was only this year that Vienna city authorities unveiled
plaques to mark remind citizens of the sites where synagogues stood
50 years ago. But Kleinmann and the few who survived the Holocaust
never forgot.
   It took only three weeks after the Nazi Anschluss of March 1938
for Kleinmann to lose his apprenticeship in house decorating, his
father's trade.
   Like tens of thousands of others, he was jobless because he was a
Jew. His family was too poor to emigrate and survived on meals from
a Jewish relief service.
   At first, Aryan friends helped Kleinmann's father survive,
slipping him illegal work. Soon, the help turned to scorn and
insults.
   Kleinmann's two sisters were often picked up by Nazi patrols,
mostly former friends, for ``rubbing,'' the practice of forcing Jews
to rub walls, pavements and cobblestone roads to remove painted
slogans predating the Nazi annexation.
   ``I remember that one day I asked a former friend why he was
picking up my sister,'' Kleinmann said. ``He said he was ordered to
get hold of the girl by a Nazi cell foreman, whom she had once
refused to kiss in the doorway.''

   As in hundreds of other towns across
Nazi Germany, terror struck Jews in this picturesque village on the
infamous ``Kristallnacht.'' A half-century later, students there are
still confronting the Nazi past.
   Last month, the 23 students in Stephan Kolb's history class heard
a former Jewish resident describe the tensions that led up to the
brutality of Nov. 9-10, 1938.
   Later, in a roundtable discussion with The Associated Press,
students in this town of 11,400 people north of Frankfurt discussed
the night when thugs ransacked the homes of the 10 to 15 Jews who
lived in Usingen, then a rural village.
   Martin Stenzel, 18, said Kristallnacht, named for the sparkling
shards of broken glass that littered streets and sidewalks after the
vandalism, was a ``channeling of aggression'' against the Jews.
   Asked about constant reminders of Kristallnacht and other Nazi
atrocities, he said: ``There is the danger the Nazi era could be
disposed of, or settled in a way. But this history should always be
alive.''
   Stenzel also sees sharp differences among generations in West
Germany, which has paid more than 80 billion marks ($44 billion at
1988 values) to Nazi victims and their families.
   ``The older generation has kept the prejudiced view of Jews,'' he
said, adding that this wasn't true with younger generations.
   Sonja Moses, 20, said: ``I can well imagine there were feelings
of jealousy because the Jews were merchants and in general were
better off financially. But I just don't think it could happen
again. People are more broad-minded now. They wouldn't do it again.''
   None of the six students taking part in the Oct. 13 discussion at
the Christian-Wirth School was Jewish. All are working toward the
Abitur, the examination which grants a prestigious diploma roughly
equivalent to a junior college degree in the United States.
   Ms. Moses, like her classmates, also said the older generation
views the Nazi era far differently from today's younger Germans.
   ``My grandmother tells me that Hitler brought order to the
country,'' said Ms. Moses, adding that her grandmother dwells on the
chaos that plagued the Weimar Republic after World War I. ``She says
after Hitler came to power, it wasn't that way anymore. You could
walk down the street without being afraid.''
   Albrecht Pachl, 18, agreed the ``biggest danger'' was that the
legacy of the Nazis could eventually be put aside.
   But he, too, noted that some Germans think it is time to stop
dwelling on the past.
   ``Many people feel under attack, including from people outside
the country,'' Pachl said of Holocaust reminders.
   He said he remembered watching television documentaries as a
child.
   ``I had the feeling it was aimed at me as a German,'' Pachl said.
   Kerstin Dumke, 18, said of Kristallnacht violence, ``I can
imagine that some people were swept up by what was happening, even
if they didn't have any hatred for the Jews beforehand.''
   Like the others interviewed, Ms. Dumke has traveled to other
countries, and she said the Nazi past comes up there, too.
   ``There's less interest in what is happening today than what
happened in the past. It's something that you drag around with you
all the time,'' she said.
   The students had heard from Ernst Lilienstein, 67, an Usingen
native who emigrated a year before that terrible night. A retired
New York City educator, Lilienstein studied at the Christian-Wirth
School more than 50 years ago, according to the 42-year-old Kolb.
   ``For some of them, it was the first time they'd ever seen a Jew,
knowing it was a Jew. Certainly, it was the first time many had
really talked to a Jew,'' Kolb said.
   In a telephone interview from his home in New York City,
Lilienstein said of his meeting: ``I was amazed both at their lack
of knowledge about what really happened, but also at their interest
in questioning me.''

   Mitchell Maulfair claimed he got bladder cancer
because he handled plutonium during the 26 years he worked at the
Rocky Flats nuclear plant near Denver.
   Maulfair, who retired about two years before the cancer was
diagnosed, filed suit against the Energy Department contractors who
operate the nuclear weapons facility. As part of a 1986 out-of-court
settlement, Maulfair agreed not to discuss any payments he might
receive or make any further charges that the cancer, which was
removed surgically and has not recurred, was caused by exposure to
the plutonium processed at Rocky Flats.
   ``If I disclose anything about the agreement, they can come back
and sue me,'' said the 71-year-old Maulfair, who now lives in Fort
Laramie, Wyo. ``They have people like me pretty well shut-up.''
   Maulfair's case is symptomatic of the problems faced by the
90,000 workers at the Energy Deparment's nuclear weapons production
complex in documenting any relation between exposure to radiation
and cancer or other diseases.
   Four of the 17 major facilities operated by the department in 13
states have been wholly or partially closed down for safety reasons,
bringing nuclear weapons production to a virtual halt. And Energy
Secretary John S. Herrington has informed Congress that it could
cost as much as $110 billion to clean up radioactive contamination
at the sites and make them safe.
   However, present and past workers in the nuclear weapons complex
say they still face a wall of secrecy around the effects of
radiation on their health.
   Safety concerns have prompted unions and individuals to file
dozens of lawsuits across the country.
   Additionally, some unions and other critics are demanding that
the Energy Department provide independent researchers or another
federal agency with data it has collected on 600,000 people who
worked in the nuclear weapons production complex, starting with the
top secret Manhattan Project in 1942.
   The research is being conducted by Oak Ridge Associated
Universities, a consortium of 49 colleges, unversities and other
institutions analyzing the data under contract with the Energy
Department.
   Critics, and they are legion, have accused the Energy Department
of suppressing and distorting data and delaying the research, and
failing to inform workers at nuclear weapons plants of the practical
implications of scientific findings.
   Dr. Anthony Robbins, director of the federal government's
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health from 1978 to
1981, said ``there is a potentially great risk'' to workers in the
nuclear weapons complex.
   ``The real issue is that the Energy Department has chosen not to
look too closely at the problem,'' said Robbins.
   The criticism had prompted senior officials in the department to
review their health policies, said C. Anson Franklin, assistant
energy secretary for public affairs.
   ``There are two issues we are looking at. One is the narrow issue
of access to the data, for people who claim they have attempted to
see it and have been denied,'' said Franklin. That issue might be
resolved within the month, he said.
   The department also is reviewing ``the wider issue of what we are
doing with epidemilogical studies,'' and that officials might decide
that major changes were needed in the way scientific analysis is
conducted and how the results are presented to workers.
   The department has spent $42 million since 1964 analyzing the
health and death records of 300,000 of the 600,000 workers who have
worked in the federal nuclear weapons complex.
   That research has been turned over to the Oak Ridge group, and
its published findings are ambiguous. An Oak Ridge research team
headed by Donna L. Cragle, under contract from the Energy
Department, found in a study released last month that a
``statistically significant'' number of a sample of 1,274 male
workers at the Savannah River Plant died from leukemia, a cancer of
the blood system.
   However, the study also said the incidence of leukemia was
``unexplained,'' meaning that researchers were unable to establish a
direct link between cancer and possible exposure to radiation at the
plant, which produces plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons.
   And it found ``fewer than the expected number of deaths'' from
other types of cancer and diseases sometimes associated with
exposure to radiation.
   The three working reactors at the plant, near Aiken, S.C., have
been closed down for safety reasons and the first will not be
restarted until next month at the earliest, according to Energy
Department officials.
   ``Workers at the plant could have been exposed to external
radiation from nuclear fuel processing activities and internal
radiation from inhalation or ingestion of tritium, uranium, fission
products, iodine, activation products, or other radionuclides
including americium, plutonium, and neptunium,'' the Oak Ridge group
said in a statement.
   It said that ``while examining individual cases, the researchers
also found that a statistically significant, but yet unexplained,
increase in the number of deaths from all types of leukemia combined
among hourly employees hired before 1955 who were employed at SRP
(Savannah River Plant) between five and seven years.''
   An Energy Department spokesman, Will Callicott, said that the
results obtained by the Oak Ridge group indicate ``the work needs to
continue.''
   Robbins, a professor of public health at Boston University and
former Colorado state health commissioner, said the Oak Ridge
results were skewed because they failed to take into account the
``healthy worker effect.'' The disease rates among Savannah River
workers, he said, were compared with those of the general
population, which includes elderly and hospitalized people, rather
than the working population, which is healthier overall.
   ``If they come back with an answer that says that leukemia is
elevated, then my conclusion is that the rates are much higher than
normal,'' Robbins said.
   Cragle, the Oak Ridge researcher, said ``a lot of the criticism
kind of goes overboard.'' The healthy worker effect was not
relevant, because if you keep track of the popluation over a period
of 20 years, the worker population begins to resemble the overall
population,'' she said.
   And she said the research was going as quickly as possible, under
the current budget.
   David Ortlieb, director of the health and safety department of
the International Chemical Workers' Union, based in Akron, Ohio,
complained that the Energy Department had not told nuclear complex
employees about the results of the Oak Ridge survey.
   ``The Energy Department has not notified workers of their
studies,'' said Ortlieb. ``It seems that their primary interest is
to publish their findings in scientific journals. Workers do not
read scientific journals. There is not a system of informing
workers.''
   Cragle said that she and other researchers met regularly with
workers at the Feed Materials Production Center, in Fernald, Ohio,
and had prepared a video for the Savannah River Plant. Moreover, she
said, the results were published in layman's terms in the plant
newspaper at Savannah River.
   A Pennsylvania group, the Three Mile Island Public Health Fund,
filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Energy
Department in May 1987 to gain access to the disputed data, with the
intention of turning the information over to a noted British
epidemiologist, Dr. Alice Stewart, said fund executive seretary
Jonathan Berger.
   Anson, the senior department spokesman, said a decision would be
made on the request ``in a couple of weeks,'' but declined to
elaborate.

   The election of 100 years ago Sunday was one of
strangest in U.S. history: the candidate who won the popular vote
lost the election.
   Grover Cleveland, the incumbent president, won a narrow popular
victory against challenger Benjamin Harrison. Cleveland had
5,540,309 votes and Harrison 5,439,853.
   But Harrison took New York, Ohio and Indiana by narrow margins
for an electoral vote total of 233 to the president's 168. That has
not happened since, but New York and Ohio are among the pivotal
states this time, too.
   Both Cleveland and his wife took the defeat as a temporary
setback. On leaving the White House, Frances Cleveland told the
staff:
   ``I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments
in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now when
we come back again ... four years from today.''
   They did come back, too. In 1892, Cleveland defeated Harrison,
winning both the popular and electoral vote to become the only
president who ever served two terms that were not consecutive.
   Unknown practitioners of dirty tricks started a rumor in the 1888
campaign that Cleveland abused his young wife, whom he married in
1886. There apparently were no grounds for the rumor, which seemed
to have done him little harm _ any more than the story that he was
supporting an illegitimate child. That one was true and he admitted
it at once. The story gave rise to a celebrated street song:
   ``Maw, Maw, where's my paw?
   ``Gone to the White House
   ``Haw, haw, haw.''
   There was some doubt whether the child was his. He had known the
mother, a widow named Maria Halpin, during his early political
career in Buffalo, N.Y. She named her son Oscar Folsom Cleveland.
   In the 1884 election, which Cleveland won over James G. Blaine, a
supporter suggested:
   ``We are told that Mr. Blaine has been delinquent in office but
blameless in private life, while Mr. Cleveland has been a model of
official integrity but culpable in his personal relations. We should
therefore elect Mr. Cleveland to the public office which he is so
well qualified to fill and remand Mr. Blaine to the private station
he is admirably fitted to adorn.''
   The voters took the advice.
   Indifference to scandal was not the only thing that made
campaigns different then. Cleveland ran into trouble in 1888 because
he had a budget surplus _ the federal government's revenue amounted
to $371 million, $103 million more than its spending.
   Much of the embarrassing surplus came from tariffs on imported
goods. Cleveland, a Democrat, wanted lower tariffs. That was partly
because he wanted to import more cheap manufactured goods for the
benefit of farmers who were important supporters of his party.
   Harrison, a Republican, got support from industrialists who
wanted a high tariff to protect their products from foreign
competition.
   After the 1888 election, Harrison and the 51st Congress got rid
of the surplus. It was called the ``billion-dollar Congress''
because it was the first that ever spent that much. There was some
help from Harrison. A Civil War hero himself, he appointed as
commissioner of pensions ``Corporal'' James Tanner, whose policy was
to help ``every old comrade that needs it.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, buoyed by surveys indicating a
tightening presidential race, declared today that ``the Republicans
began celebrating a little early.'' George Bush shrugged off the
numbers and said, ``You know me, I don't believe those polls.''
   The candidates launched their final weekend of campaigning amid a
blizzard of pre-election polls. Aides hastily re-constructed
campaign schedules on the basis of those numbers and thus Dukakis
was spending the day in Illinois, Michigan and Texas while Bush
focused on New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Colorado.
   In Rock Island, Ill., Dukakis told a warehouse rally, ``I think
the Republican Party began celebrating a little early, don't you?
They were taking you for granted.''
   He also continued his populist appeal.
   ``We're on the side of people who live off a family budget, not a
family fortune,'' he said. ``He's on their side. We're on your
side.''
   Bush said he didn't trust new polls indicating a closer race.
``You know me, I don't believe those polls,'' he said.
   The Republican nominee told workers in his Clark, N.J.,
headquarters that the Democrats set the negative tone of the
campaign.
   ``Let me tell you ... what I've had to do because I think
everybody here and everybody across the country knows that when the
national Democratic campaign came on and that convention, they
thought they were going to kick my brains out and get away with it.
They can dish it out but they can't take it,'' he said.
   Both presidential candidates were showing no signs of letting up
in the final three days of the campaign, as a poll released Friday
showed that Bush's lead shrank from 12 points to seven points in
three days. The CBS News poll said Bush was leading 51 percent to 44
percent among probable voters, but also indicated as much as 24
percent of voters may not have made a final decision.
   Another half dozen national polls were expected over the weekend
as well as a flurry of state-by-state surveys.
   A poll of Minnesota voters, for example, showed Bush leading 48
percent to 45 percent, the first time the Republican has led Dukakis
in that state. The Northstar Poll was conducted by the St. Paul
Pioneer Press Dispatch, WCCO-TV and WCCO-Radio. The four-point
margin of error made the lead statistically meaningless.
   Lloyd Bentsen was in Los Angeles for a rally aimed at nabbing
California's 47 electoral votes. ``We win this one, we win it all,''
he said upon arrival Friday at Burbank airport.
   Dukakis, who has entered the final stages of his campaign by
invoking traditional Democratic themes and names, further aligned
himself with that past by marching in Chicago's Democratic
torchlight parade.
   Although Dukakis had been growing increasingly hoarse in this
final week, his voice was working at nearly full throttle when he
told a post-parade rally:
   ``In 1960, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson went into that last
weekend down eight points in the polls,'' he told an audience that
went to its feet more than a dozen times. ``We're doing better than
that. You can feel that surge and you can feel that excitement.''
   He was joined by his wife, Kitty, who was recovering from a viral
infection, and four former rivals: Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., Jesse
Jackson, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and Sen. Al Gore Jr.,
D-Tenn.
   Bush interspersed his campaign appearances with individual media
interviews. He, President Reagan and running mate Dan Quayle pounced
on a Boston Herald headline, ``What a Mess!,'' referring to the
state's finances.
   ``He got into it by overspending,'' Bush told a rally in
Fairfield, Conn., ``How did he get out of it or try to? By raising
taxes a total of $180 million this year alone. ... Now he's
borrowing like mad, writing checks that he doesn't even have enough
money in the bank to cover.''
   Reagan, campaigning in Voorhees Township, N.J., said
Massachusetts ranked 30th among states in annual job growth in 1986
and 1987, ``and with yesterday's papers reporting a state bank
account overdrawn by as much as $190 million for a month, the
Massachusetts mess is getting sloppier and sloppier by the day.''
   ``He likes to talk about a Massachusetts miracle,'' Quayle said
in Monroe, La., ``But the only miracle involving Massachusetts will
be the one he needs to get out of the mess he created for his
state.''
   Bush and Dukakis, interviewed back-to-back Friday on ABC's
``World News Tonight,'' were asked about the nastiness that has
pervaded their race. Bush said his own campaign has been
``hardhitting but it's been fair and it's been accurate.''
   Dukakis countered that Bush was attacking him to ``divert
attention from a failed record on the war against drugs, from the
kind of sleaze and corruption we've seen in Washington.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Bush also said: ``The
idea that this campaign is so different from others _ I don't
believe it. I don't think the American people believe it, all this
stuff about being turned off.''
   Both campaigns were pouring a fortune into network advertising
campaigns over the weekend _ $1.3 million was the announced figure
for Bush and $375,000 for Dukakis _ not to mention additional
thousands on both sides for commercials targeted to battleground
states.
   In addition to their weekend advertising plans, each candidate
has paid nearly $1 million to buy a half-hour slot on all three
networks on Election Eve. Dukakis will make his final appeal at 8
p.m. EST followed by Bush at 8:30 p.m.

   George Bush's lead in the polls is causing some
political operatives to worry that the networks might call a
landslide win early on election evening and discourage potential
voters in some close Senate races.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said pleas to the TV networks to withhold
conclusions about the election's outcome until after West Coast
polls are closed have yielded little.
   ``We have asked them not to call the race based on exit
polling,'' Kerry said. But he acknowledged that ``the competitive
drive is going to escape any kind of restraint.''
   Both Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis have pledged not to make
any statement of victory or defeat until all polls on the West Coast
have closed.
   The pledges from the two camps are ``a significant step to
increase voter participation in Tuesday's election,'' said Rep. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., who solicited the statements from the two campaigns.
   Television executives have said they will not call the election
in any state until its polls are closed. But they also have made it
clear that if a candidate exceeds the 270 electoral vote margin
needed for election, they will not sit on the news.
   Polls in Eastern states begin to close as early as 6 p.m., while
the closing time in California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii is 11
p.m. Eastern time. For Alaska, poll closing is midnight Eastern time.
   Kerry said the effect of announcing a presidential election
victory before all polls are closed might be to discourage West
Coast voters from casting their ballots, even though local races
might be very tight.
   In Washington, the race between Democratic Rep. Mike Lowry and
Republican former Sen. Slade Gorton is a dead heat, as is the Nevada
contest between incumbent Sen. Chic Hecht, a Republican, and
Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan.
   Those races, as well as potentially close Senate contests in
Montana and California could be affected by an early outcome in the
presidential race, Kerry said.
   ``It was disastrous in 1980,'' when Democratic Sen. Warren
Magnuson of Washington lost after the networks called the election
for Ronald Reagan shortly after 8 p.m. and President Carter conceded
soon afterward, Kerry said.
   Then, there were reports that voters lined up at polling places
went home without voting after hearing the outcome of the
presidential race reported, based on network exit polling.
   This time, it is unclear what effect an early call might have on
the closest Western Senate races. Kerry said, for example, that
because Lowry has devoted followers and a highly organized campaign,
he might be able to turn out his supporters anyway and such a
development might hurt his opponent, Gorton.
   But regardless of the effect, he said, discouraging any voter
``negates the electoral process'' and is wrong.
   Legislation to address the problem through instituting a uniform
poll-closing time across the country's six time zones has not been
able to get through Congress.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas have stepped
up attacks in the capital, staging bold daylight raids and
threatening to fulfill their pledge to bring the 9-year-old war to
the cities.
   Urban commandos last week hit the national guard headquarters
with mortar and rifle fire, killing four soldiers and wounding 38
people. It was the largest attack in the city in seven years.
   ``This is only the beginning,'' the rebels boasted in a broadcast
on their clandestine Radio Venceremos. ``Prepare yourselves
Salvadorans, the hour is near.''
   The barracks attack capped more than a month of increased
activity by the Farbabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a group
of five leftist armies battling the U.S.-backed and -supplied
government since 1979.
   The rebels say they are showing their strength. The U.S. embassy
says the guerrillas are losing in the country and the city attacks
are an act of desperation and a search for publicity.
   The ultra-convervative National Republican Alliance, known as
Arena, blames the raids on a ``power vacuum'' in President Jose
Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democratic government.
   Duarte is ill with terminal cancer and, for the first time in
years, the March elections will include leftist candidates.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker linked renewed rebel activity to
the presidential elections and a Nov. 14 meeting of the Organization
of American States in San Salvador.
   ``With the world's, or at least the hemispheric spotlight on
them, they are using dramatic gestures to say `we're here,''' the
ambassador said.
   The guerrillas promised to take the war to the cities early last
year, but until recently their attacks were infrequent and small.
   However, since Sept. 13 the guerrillas have maintained pressure
in rural areas and moved into new regions of this
Massachussetts-sized nation of 5 million.
   ``As of today I know what the war is. Before it had been only on
the television,'' said Isabel Burgos, a resident of Zaragoza, after
an Oct. 6 attack on the town 12 miles south of San Salvador.
   That same day commandos using grenade launchers staged a
rapid-fire morning attack on the Legislative Assembly in San
Salvador.
   On Oct. 18, two car bombs exploded in parking lots in the posh
Escalon neighborhood.
   ``There are no more areas of tranquility for the guardians of
exploitation. It is not fair that the bombs and explosions are heard
only in the rural zones, in the homes of the poor,'' the rebels said
in a broadcast.
   The military has increased patrols in the sprawling capital, but
the 1 million or so inhabitants seem unaffected by the war.
   Working-class neighborhoods still teem with activity. Crowds cram
the outdoor cafes in the chic Zona Rosa, scene of a 1985 hit-and-run
shooting that killed six Americans, including four U.S. Marines.
   However, the guerrillas' occasional calls for transportation
stoppages are largely respected.
   The U.S. Embassy, which overseas $1.5 million in aid per day to
the Salvadoran government, says the guerrillas are frustrated
because they haven't been able to topple the elected Duarte
administration.
   ``There's no doubt of increased actions (in the capital) in the
last couple of months,'' Walker said in an interview last week.
``But blowing up a hamburger joint is not a great demonstration of
military strength.''
   Asked about Wednesday's national guard attack, he said: ``They
can do that on occasion and will be able to do that for some time.
But it doesn't particularly demonstrate military prowess.''
   More than 65,000 Salvadorans, many of them civilians, have been
killed in the war. The last attack as large as the national guard
attack came in January 1981, when the guerrillas launched a failed
``final offensive.''
   Groups traditionally sympathetic to the guerrillas, including the
Roman Catholic Church, criticized the recent actions, especially the
car bombs.
   Carlos Diaz Barrera, a member of the newly formed Democratic
Convergence, a coalition of three leftist parties, also said
civilians should be respected but added that the barracks attack was
a legitimate act of war.
   ``These are the effects and not the causes of the war. The causes
are internal, produced by extreme poverty, the oligarchy and U.S.
intervention,'' Diaz Barrera said.

   Far longer than it had to be, and too nasty as
well, the 1988 presidential campaign is as certain to trigger calls
for reform as it is to elect the 41st president of the United States.
   The money, the tone and the timing are ripe for examination
whether Republican George Bush or Democrat Michael Dukakis is the
winner on Tuesday.
   A Bush victory would send the Democrats into another agonizing
round of internal debate. This was the guy the Democrats wanted to
run against, the wimp who couldn't win.
   Republicans are less inclined to try to reinvent the wheel after
every defeat. But a Dukakis victory would accelerate the
conservative drive to purge moderates and create a more
ideologically oriented party.
   A Bush victory would revive talk by Republicans of a political
realignment in their favor and would force Democrats to confront new
evidence that Americans like divided government _ Republican
presidents and Democratic Congresses.
   Whichever candidate wins, the big loser could be Iowa.
   Politicians are growing weary of the state whose caucuses
dominate the first two months of the nomination campaign.
   Bush finished an embarrassing third in the 1988 Iowa caucuses,
reason enough for him to support any move to diminish the state's
influence.
   On the Democratic side, the state often seems a collection of
special interest groups intent on demanding that candidates take
positions they'll regret during the general election campaign.
   New Hampshire does its best to diminish Iowa's impact by
consistently reversing the results of the caucuses. But the early
New Hampshire primary doesn't have much more support than the Iowa
caucuses.
   Beyond the purely political consequences of Tuesday's outcome,
the sheer ugliness of this campaign ought to prompt calls for change.
   A familiar figure returned to prominence in 1988 _ the fat cat.
Through much of the campaign, the candidates disappeared from public
view after dark.
   They weren't getting some rest or curling up with position
papers. They were schmoozing with $100,000 contributors.
   Dukakis liked to say he was ``more interested in the lathe
operators and the machine operators'' than in the ``sharp
operators'' on Wall Street. But his campaign spent a lot of time
getting the candidate together with the operators willing to write
big checks toward a $50 million fund-raising goal.
   The Democrats were only trying to catch up with what the
Republicans had been doing for years _ raising big bucks for
``party-building'' _ political activity not covered by federal
limits on contributions.
   That ``soft money'' was a campaign asset over and above the $46.1
million in public funds given to each candidate.
   A lot of the money went for good causes such as voter
registration drives, but it also returned the parties and the
candidates to an uncomfortable dependence upon fat cats. Maybe $100
contributors will have the same access to a President Bush or a
President Dukakis as $100,000 contributors. Maybe not.
   A common saying during much of this as well as past past
campaigns was that ``voters haven't started paying attention yet.''
For months and months and months, we were told that voters were
ignoring the whole process.
   Then why in heaven's name will the 1992 presidential campaign
begin on Nov. 9, 1988?
   The simple answer is the need to raise millions of dollars. The
only solution probably is to have a late-starting candidate win his
party's nomination and go on to be elected president. Politicians
are like television programmers, they always try to duplicate the
most recent hit show.
   The most disturbing aspect of the 1988 campaign was the negative
tone.
   Can that be changed? Not so long as it works. Every politician
who knows the road to election is the low one won't hesitate to take
it.

   Michael Dukakis told voters today the
Republicans were ``taking you for granted'' and predicted he would
upset George Bush on Election Day.
   Dukakis continued his populist appeal as he addressed a warehouse
rally of 5,000.
   ``We're on the side of people who live off a family budget, not a
family fortune,'' he said. ``He's on their side. We're on your
side.''
   Dukakis noted new polls showing him closing the gap.
   ``I think the Republican Party began celebrating a little early,
don't you? They were taking you for granted,'' he said.
   Dukakis had another grueling day planned today, with more rallies
in Lansing and Detroit, Mich., and a joint appearance with running
mate Lloyd Bentsen in Texas before heading to Colorado to spend the
night.
   The Democratic presidential nominee received a rousing welcome in
Chicago on Friday night, marching with four former rivals and 15,000
people in a traditional torchlight parade and later addressing a
rowdy rally attended by another 6,000 supporters.
   ``In 1960 John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson went into that last
weekend down eight points in the polls _ We're doing better than
that,'' Dukakis said. ``You can feel that surge and you can feel
that excitement.''
   His voice has been raspy for days because of the busy schedule,
but Dukakis sounded Friday night as if his voice was making a
comeback.
   ``We know this race is not over,'' he said to thunderous applause
at the post-parade rally. ``We're going to work even harder and
every day until those polls close on the 8th of November and we're
going to retire Mr. Bush.''
   Dukakis recalled a joke used by John Kennedy in the 1960
campaign, when then-Vice President Richard Nixon was trying to
succeed President Eisenhower. He amended it for the current race, in
which Vice President Bush is vying to succeed President Reagan.
   ``The lead elephant is about to leave the circus,'' Dukakis said
of Reagan and the animal that serves as the symbol of the Republican
Party. ``And the No. 2 elephant has stopped dead in his tracks. He's
coasting and we're fighting, all over this country.''
   Dukakis aides, to support their contention Dukakis is closing
fast on Bush, cited a new CBS poll that showed Dukakis trailing Bush
51 percent to 44 percent. They also said internal campaign polls
said Dukakis was now ahead in Illinois and Michigan, must-win states
in his upset formula.
   But Dukakis trails in Texas, Ohio and New Jersey and would need
to win at least one of them if he is to realize his plan, which also
counts on victories in Pennsylvania, New York, California and a
number of smaller states.
   It appears the Dukakis campaign has given up on Ohio and will
attempt to win Texas. Dukakis aides had been talking about returning
to Ohio but no such stop is scheduled and Dukakis may make a second
appearance in Texas tonight if arrangements can be worked out.
   Polls have shown Bush with a consistent lead in Texas but the
Dukakis camp insists Bentsen, a Texas senator, is still capable of
delivering his state.
   At the Chicago event, as he did earlier in the day in New York
and Kentucky, Dukakis ridiculed Bush's recent adoption of the new
Dukakis battle cry _ ``I'm on your side.''
   ``Four days before the election, after all the ads and
distortions and the rest of it, he says he's on your side.'' Dukakis
said. ``Who's he kidding. Who's he kidding.''
   Dukakis chided Bush for supporting a capital gains tax break the
Democrat called a boon for the rich and declared:
   ``He's not on our side. He's on their side. And the American
people are going to reject him on Tuesday.''
   Marching in the parade with Dukakis were former rivals Paul
Simon, the Illinois senator, Jesse Jackson, Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt.
   Also on hand was Kitty Dukakis, who rejoined her husband after
spending several days in a Minnesota hospital with a respiratory
virus.

<HEAD>Bush Hotter Favorite Than Ever With British Oddsmakers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British bookmakers say George Bush is now a hotter
favorite than at any time in the campaign to defeat Michael Dukakis
in Tuesday's presidential election.
   William Hill and Coral, two of the country's major bookmakers,
said Saturday they had shortened the odds to 1-to-7 on Vice
President Bush, and lengthened the odds on the Massachusetts
governor to 4-to-1.
   The 1-to-7 odds on Bush means if the Republican candidate wins, a
bet of $7 would win $1 plus the original stake. A bet of $1 on
Dukakis, the Democratic candidate, would win $4 plus the stake.

   A Cornell University student whose father is a top government
computer security expert created the ``virus'' that slowed 6,000
computers nationwide, said a report today, and the school found that
the young man possessed unauthorized computer codes.
   But Cornell staff may not be able to determine if Robert T.
Morris Jr., a graduate student in the university's computer science
program, was the source of the virus, M. Stuart Lynn, vice president
of information technologies at Cornell, said at a news conference
today in Ithaca, N.Y.
   Three sources with detailed knowledge of the case told The New
York Times that Morris, 23, whom friends describe as ``brilliant,''
devised the virus as an experiment.
   Cornell officials did not suspect the virus may have originated
in their computer system until reporters asked questions Friday
night after the Times report was published, Lynn said.
   ``We are investigating his computer files at Cornell, and so far
we have determined that his account contains files that appear to
hold passwords for some computers at Cornell and Stanford to which
he is not entitled,'' lynn said. ``We also have discovered that
Morris' account contains a list of passwords substantially similar
to those found in the virus.''
   Passwords are the codes needed to gain access to computer systems.
   The student's father, Robert Morris Sr., is chief scientist at
the National Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md., the arm of
the National Security Agency devoted to protecting computers from
outside attack. He has written widely on the security of the Unix
operating system, the computer master program that was the target of
the computer virus.
   The elder Morris, reached today at his home in Arnold, Md., said
his son would not be available for comment until next week.
   Computer viruses behave like biological viruses in that they
duplicate themselves and spread from computer to computer, through
``electronic mail'' systems or other networks. They consume computer
processing power and storage space, and some _ but apparently not
this one _ destroy stored information.
   The virus was introduced into Arpanet, a Department of Defense
computer network linking universities, research centers and defense
operations, officials said. It was intended to remain there
undetected, slowly making copies that would move from computer to
computer, the Times said.
   But a design error caused it instead to replicate out of control,
the Times reported Friday, quoting an anonymous caller to the
newspaper who said he was an associate of the program's designer.
   The virus jammed more than 6,000 computers nationwide starting
Wednesday. But it apparently caused no damage other than lost
research time and the thousands of costly hours that computer
scientists and programmers were spending to remove it from their
systems. By Friday, most universities and research centers had
turned their computers back on.
   George Strawn, director of the Computation Center at Iowa State
University in Des Moines, described the impact of the virus at his
school as ``a slight case of the sniffles.''
   Doug Van Houweling, vice provost for information technology at
the University of Michigan, said no files were damaged but many
hours of work were needed to clean out ``duplicate waste files'' the
virus created.
   Hans-Werner Braun, a computer expert at the Ann Arbor, Mich.,
school, said the main effect of the incident was to call attention
to the system's vulnerability.
   The elder Morris told the Times that the virus ``has raised the
public awareness to a considerable degree. It is likely to make
people more careful and more attentive to vulnerabilities in the
future.''
   Sources told the Times that his son flew to Washington on Friday
and planned to hire a lawyer and meet with officials in charge of
the Arpanet network to discuss the incident.
   Computer scientists said the younger Morris worked in recent
summers at the American Telephone and Telegraph Co.'s Bell
Laboratories. One of his projects included rewriting the
communications security software for most computers that run the
Unix operating system, which AT&T developed, the Times reported.
   Computer scientists who are disassembling the virus to learn how
it worked said they have been impressed with its power and
cleverness.
   The elder Morris, 56, told the Times that it was ``the work of a
bored graduate student.''
   Dexter Kozen, the graduate faculty representative in Cornell's
computer science department, said he chuckled when he heard that
quote.
   ``We try to keep them from getting bored,'' he said. ``I guess we
didn't try hard enough.''

   Seething hatred of the Jews,
fanned by Adolf Hitler's propagandists, exploded 50 years ago in the
Nazis' well-coordinated night of ransacking, torching and beating
called ``Kristallnacht.''
   Boastfully dubbed Crystal Night by the Nazis because of the
sparkling shards of glass from thousands of smashed windows, that
single night of terror was also the dawn of the murderous seven-year
Holocaust.
   The Nazis eventually killed an estimated 6 million Jews and
hundreds of thousands of others they labeled ``undesirables.''
   Throughout Germany on Nov. 9-10, 1938, Nazis rampaged against
Jews in major cities as well as those few left in small towns after
years of persecution.
   The balance of the terrifying destruction, according to official
Nazi count: 195 synagogues and 7,500 businesses destroyed, thousands
of homes ransacked. Officially, 36 Jews were slain, some as they
fled burning buildings. Other accounts, however, indicate that at
least 1,118 synagogues were vandalized and as many as 1,000 Jews
were killed or committed suicide.
   Thousands more Jews _ men, women and children _ were beaten. More
than 30,000 were arrested and shipped off to concentration camps in
the first major step in the systematic Nazi campaign to annihilate
European Jews.
   The action, which became known as the ``Night of Broken Glass''
in English, stunned the outside world and bluntly heralded the
Nazis' intentions to ``Aryanize'' society and business.
   Germans in both East and West have for months been making
elaborate plans to mark the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht,
including solemn ceremonies, panel discussions and new publications.
   Even half a century later, the memory of the terror haunts its
victims.
   Alfred Jachmann was an 11-year-old in the town of Arnswalde _ now
Choszczno in northern Poland.
   ``We were sleeping behind shutters with the windows closed,''
Jachmann recalled in an interview. ``We were jerked out of our sleep
by the crashing glass. We heard the screams: `The synaogue is
burning!'
   ``My father screamed, `Yes, the sky's all red!' We lived just 500
meters from the synagogue. We were hiding behind him for three
hours. We were shaking from fear and terror. Uniformed Nazis rushed
into our house. They arrested my father without saying a word,'' he
said.
   ``My sister, Gerda, and I were crying terribly,'' added the
61-year-old Jachmann, now head of the Jewish home for the elderly in
Frankfurt. ``My sister, mother and I had to leave Arnswalde within
three days.''
   Jachmann's mother, father and 13-year-old sister all died in the
Auschwitz concentration camp. Jachmann, also sent to Auschwitz,
later saved himself by plunging into the snow when Nazi
machine-gunners mowed down prisoners in January 1945.
   In what the Nazis called ``spontaneous anti-Jewish
demonstrations,'' Kristallnacht raged across the German Reich,
including Austria and the recently annexed Sudetenland region of
Czechoslovakia. In addition to homes, businesses and synagogues, the
Nazi gangs ransacked Jewish hospitals, orphanages and homes for the
elderly.
   In the city of Erfurt near Weimar, all Jewish men aged 18 to 80
were rounded up and forced into a local gymnasium.
   ``Some of the Nazis especially took to task Jews whom they
personally knew, to vent their fury on them,'' said local B'nai
B'rith president Harry Stern.
   ``We had to line up and march around to the sounds of the
Horst-Wessel song (a Nazi favorite). Then we were commanded to
scream `Death to the Jews'' and we had to do it,'' said Stern. Some
were savagely beaten with whips, he said.
   ``Then we were loaded into buses and brought to Buchenwald, where
we arrived at dawn,'' Stern recalled in historian Wolfgang Benz's
recently published book, ``The Jews in Germany 1933-45.''
   In other cities, Jews were herded into courtyards before the men
were separated from their families and sent to concentration camps.
   Valentin Senger, then a non-practicing Jew from a staunchly
Communist family, witnessed the outcome of Kristallnacht in
Frankfurt, where some of the worst violence took place.
   ``On the morning of the 10th, I went to the factory where I
worked, and on the way to the factory, I ran into a secretary. She
said: `Have you heard the synagogue is burning?''' he recalled.
   Senger described the mushroom cloud of smoke coming from the
direction of the Boerneplatz. When he reached the synagogue, he said
smoke was billowing from the roof, flames leaping through the
windows.
   ``Hundreds of people were standing nearby,'' he said. ``The area
was blocked off by police. The fire department was there, but they
weren't trying to put out the fire. They had instructions to let the
synagogue burn, but to keep nearby buildings from burning.
   ``I stood there and never heard any words of approval or applause
or bravos. The people looked stiffly and silently into the fire. No
one critcized it either. The fear was too great.
   ``That was the first time I felt I belonged to them, I belonged
there, that's my people. My synagogue was burning. I really felt
that I was a Jew,'' the 69-year-old retired journalist told the AP
in an interview. ``I saw they were rounding up the Jews and putting
them on trucks, that same day. The Jews were being mistreated and
beaten.''
   Senger survived in Frankfurt by hiding from the Nazis and using
false documents.
   Much to the annoyance of Nazi finance chief Hermann Goering,
Kristallnacht had an unforeseen and nearly disastrous impact.
   The damage, calculated at 25 million reichsmarks, worth about
$6.25 million, shocked German insurance companies. They noted that
just replacing the broken glass would hurt the Third Reich, since
the glass had to be imported with much-needed hard currency.
   ``I wish you had killed 200 Jews instead of destroying so many
valuables,'' Goering told Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi fanatic who
gave the Teletyped orders for Kristallnacht.
   Eventually, the Nazis confiscated the insurance proceeds and
slapped the Jews with a $250 million fine.
   Fifty years later, the anniversary is still creating conflict,
including debate over the best way to mark the day and the extent to
which government leaders should participate.
   Roman Catholic bishops from East Germany, West Germany and
Austria last month issued a joint statement that sharply questioned
Christian leaders' failure 50 years ago to publicly condemn the Nazi
night of terror. The bishops implied that Christian ``failings''
were partly responsible for the Holocaust.
   In September, Ignaz Bubis, leader of the Frankfurt Jewish
Community, stunned the government when he publicly urged Chancellor
Helmut Kohl to have President Richard von Weizsaecker write Kohl's
speech.
   Kohl has occasionally upset West German Jews with what they
consider insensitivity toward their concerns. Weizsaecker, on the
other hand, has gained the Jews' admiration for urging Germans to
face the Nazi past.
   West German Jews also frequently object to the word
Kristallnacht, saying it minimizes the atrocities that followed the
rampages. They prefer the term ``Pogrom Night.''
   When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Germany had 530,000 Jews.
About 32,000 Jews live in West Germany today. In East Germany, the
estimated number of practicing Jews is 450-600, with no permanent
rabbi.

   George Bush on Saturday admitted to ``a certain
pleasantness'' when he's together with Michael Dukakis, but hold on.
   ``I've been accused of liking ... almost everybody,'' the vice
president said.
   Bush and Dukakis were interviewed by David Frost for an hour-long
program ``The Next President: The Final Chapter'' to be broadcast on
television over 162 stations this weekend.
   Frost put the question about liking the opponent to both
candidates.
   ``I don't normally get personally angry or annoyed at the people
that I run against,'' said Dukakis. He added he was surprised and
disappointed at Bush's campaign and added, ``there's something I
think out of character about this and there are people who know him
who believe that.''
   As for Bush, he said, too, that he didn't know his opponent well.
   ``But the contacts I've had with him have been very pleasant,''
Bush said. ``But I've been accused of liking, liking, you know,
almost everybody, and I think there is a lot of good in everyone and
certainly in my opponent.
   ``I find when we are together, there's a certain pleasantness, in
spite of the tension.''

<HEAD>75th Anniversary Of Aqueduct Running Owens River Water To LA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was a carnival atmosphere when 30,000
people gathered on a dusty hillside 75 years ago to see water
carried almost 226 miles through the city's new Owens River Aqueduct
from the eastern Sierra Nevada.
   ``There it is! Take it!'' shouted William Mulholland, the city
water superintendent.
   Los Angeles took it, and more.
   Conceived with foresight, planned with guile, built in
determination and surrounded by profiteering and hyperbole, the
aqueduct, which opened Nov. 5, 1913, has spun a compelling history.
   ``The aqueduct to the Owens Valley was the foundation of the
modern megalopolis. It allowed Los Angeles to invent itself,'' said
William L. Kahrl, whose 1982 book ``Water and Power'' is considered
an authoritative history of the project.
   ``What was done in the early 1900s is still very much with us,''
said Abe Hoffman, whose book ``Vision or Villainy'' is another
definitive study. ``The city of Los Angeles has been on a growth
mentality really all the way.''
   Water allowed Los Angeles to make the desert bloom.
   It made arid real estate in the San Fernando Valley suddenly
valuable and led to widespread speculation.
   But water diverted southward to Los Angeles also prevented the
Owens River Valley from blossoming into the center of commerce that
its turn-of-the-century residents wanted it to be.
   Los Angeles officials ensured this by buying land in the Owens
Valley _ at first covertly to acquire the water rights and later
imperiously to take irrigated farmland out of production and save
even more water for the city.
   Valley residents reacted by repeatedly bombing the aqueduct, and
armed night riders took to the roads. The city responded with
truckloads of armed guards.
   Today, Los Angeles owns about 300,000 acres in Inyo and Mono
counties along the Nevada border.
   Storytellers sympathetic to the ranchers portrayed the Owens
Valley as a democratic Eden and the sinuous aqueduct as the evil
serpent causing their ruination.
   Nor could Hollywood resist the temptation of embellishing the
tale with John Wayne in the 1935 film ``New Frontier'' and Jack
Nicholson in the 1974 movie ``Chinatown,'' a tale of graft and greed.
   ``I would classify `Chinatown' as a fine film and a great story _
but not good history,'' Hoffman said.
   Mulholland, the self-educated ditch digger who masterminded the
aqueduct, had a tragic downfall.
   He pronounced the new Saint Francis Dam northwest of the city
safe, hours before it collapsed in 1928. More than 400 people were
killed, homes and businesses were washed away and Mulholland
resigned in disgrace.
   Kahrl and others have concluded that the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power was neither benevolent nor malicious in its
treatment of the Owens Valley. It was just coldly practical.
   ``The irony,'' said Mulholland's granddaughter, Catherine, now
65, ``is that all the land Los Angeles acquired in the Owens Valley
is pristine and gorgeous and it's Los Angeles that's been trashed.''
   ``So many mini malls. I think the developers have gotten away
with murder in the last 20 years.''

<HEAD>New Grand Jury Reviewing Iran-Contra Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors are using a new grand
jury to review testimony from last year's congressional hearings in
an apparent investigation of possible perjury by witnesses in the
case.
   The prosecutors working for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh
have been playing videotapes of the House-Senate hearings to the
federal grand jury that has been meeting regularly on the case for
about three weeks, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Because grand jury proceedings are secret, it is unclear who
might be suspected of lying under oath, either to Congress or to the
original Iran-Contra grand jury that returned indictments earlier
this year.
   But the panel could compare testimony a witness gave to Congress
with facts developed by Walsh's investigation, as well as sworn
statements that the individual or others made to the original
Iran-Contra grand jury.
   So far, the grand jury has not heard any live witnesses,
according to the sources, indicating prosecutors are laying
groundwork for the investigation by playing the videotapes of the
1987 hearings.
   The grand jury has been meeting two or three times a week for
several hours. It hears other cases unrelated to the Iran-Contra
affair.
   The new grand jury, unlike the one that indicted former White
House aide Oliver L. North and other figures in the Iran-Contra
affair, is free to review congressional testimony given under grants
of limited immunity from prosecution for evidence of perjury.
   Such grants of ``use immunity'' prohibit prosecutors from using a
witness' testimony or evidence derived from it to prosecute that
individual in court on criminal charges.
   The immunized testimony, however, could be used as evidence in a
perjury case if the witness lied to Congress or a grand jury.
   It could also be used as evidence that another person committed a
crime, raising the possibility the new panel could develop leads
from the congressional hearings that could not be followed up by the
original Iran-Contra grand jury.
   Walsh and most of his prosecutors carefully isolated themselves
from news coverage of the House-Senate committee hearings to avoid
exposure to the immunized congressional testimony.
   The independent counsel did not want to be left open to defense
accusations that his office illegally relied on the immunized
testimony as evidence to prosecute the Iran-Contra defendants.
   He also took measures to ensure that members of the original
Iran-Contra grand jury were not exposed to immunized congressional
testimony.
   The team of prosecutors presenting evidence to the new grand jury
is led by K. Chris Todd, one of the few members of Walsh's staff who
has been exposed to the congressional testimony.
   Todd's appearance at the proceedings signaled that the new
Iran-Contra grand jury is reviewing immunized congressional
testimony and that perjury is a likely subject of the inquiry.
   Walsh said in court last spring that Todd had been exposed to
testimony given to Congress and was not participating in the
prosecution of North, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.
   But Walsh testified that Todd was continuing to do unspecified
work on his staff.
   North, Poindexter, Hakim testified on Capitol Hill under limited
grants of immunity from prosecution. They are accused of conspiring
to defraud the government by diverting millions of dollars of
proceeds from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Secord, the fourth defendant in the case, gave congressional
testimony without any immunity from prosecution.
   No dates have been set for any of the four trials ordered in the
Iran-Contra conspiracy case.
   Members of the House and Senate panels openly expressed doubts
about credibility of some of the congressional witnesses, including
Poindexter.
   In their recently published book ``Men of Zeal,'' two members of
the committee, Sens. William Cohen, R-Maine, and George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, note that Poindexter ``said 184 times he could not recall
events about which he was questioned.''
   The memory lapses by a Navy rear admiral known for his keen
intellect ``raised serious questions about Poindexter's
credibility,'' the two senators wrote.
   Walsh's staff would also be in a better position to evaluate the
congressional testimony that Secord and Hakim gave about secret
Swiss bank accounts and dummy corporations through which the arms
money flowed.
   The congressional panels never saw the records of the secret bank
accounts, which Walsh only obtained after protracted legal
proceedings in Swiss courts.
   In addition, Walsh has the cooperation of Willard Zucker, an
American lawyer and financier whose Geneva company has handled many
of Hakim's business affairs for many years.
   Unlike the defendants in the case, a number of figures in the
Iran-Contra affair testified both on Capitol Hill and before the
original Iran-Contra grand jury.
   Walsh is not barred from using congressional testimony that was
not given under immunity grants.
   But his staff and the original grand jury generally avoided
exposure to accounts of the House-Senate proceedings so they
wouldn't learn about the testimony of immunized witnesses from
questions that were put to other witnesses.
   But the new grand jury would be free to compare the different
versions of testimony by many witnesses who appeared before the
original Iran-Contra grand jury and on Capitol Hill.

   A presidential campaign shaped by ``sound
bites'' and attack ads is finishing the same way it began: on
television.
   With their color schemes and TelePrompTers, anthems and pledges,
flags and balloons and children galore, the party conventions last
summer were made for TV.
   And television will also host the campaign windups _ a half-hour
of Democrat Michael Dukakis followed by a half-hour of Republican
George Bush on each of the three major networks on election eve.
Cost per candidate: nearly $1 million.
   The Dukakis program showcases the Massachusetts governor
answering questions in a town meeting setting and contains footage
of his family and his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen. The
Bush effort summarizes the vice president's achievements, beliefs
and plans for the nation.
   The two candidates set new records this year for money spent on
commercials (expected to top $30 million apiece) and for free air
time in 10-and 20-second ``sound bites'' on the news as well as talk
and interview shows.
   Some say the campaigns also set a new record for negative
advertising. And polls indicate TV ads had plenty of influence.
   Twenty-five percent of probable voters in a CBS-New York Times
poll conducted in late October said political advertising had helped
them decide how to vote. That compares to a 1984 post-election poll
in which 12 percent of registered voters said commercials had helped
them decide.
   ``The test of a good president isn't who comes up with the best
commercial,'' Dukakis said Friday, on NBC, in what sounded like an
admission of defeat on the media front.
   Bush's ads helped him define not only the issues of the campaign
but his largely unknown opponent as well.
   ``America can't afford that risk,'' Bush's attack ads said of the
prospect of electing Dukakis, whom he bashed on crime, taxes, the
environment and defense. ``Ready on day one to be a great
president,'' pro-Bush ads said, depicting him as an experienced
world leader with a warm human side.
   Dukakis' advertising effort, beset by indecision, settled in the
final days on two populist taglines: ``The best America is yet to
come'' and ``Dukakis-Bentsen. On your side.'' The themes reflected
his campaign's end-game focus on the economic concerns of workers
and the middle class.
   Foremost among the general election ads that left lingering
impressions was a Bush spot called ``Revolving Door,'' a stark
30-second procession of inmates filing in and out of a revolving
iron gate, capped with an ominous aerial view of prison grounds and
a guard tower.
   The narrator says Dukakis vetoed the death penalty and ``gave
weekend furloughs to first degree murderers not eligible for parole.
While out, many committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape and
many are still at large.'' On the screen the number 268 flashes,
implying that's how many first-degree murderers escaped and
committed crimes. In fact only one did _ Willie Horton.
   That ad, combined with another Bush commercial called ``Crime
Quiz'' _ and the millions spent by independent groups hitting on the
same themes _ helped fuel an image of Dukakis as soft on crime.
   The governor was slow to respond, though he eventually came up
with ads citing figures showing that crime has dropped substantially
in his state while he has been in charge.
   Dukakis also struck back with a series of ``Packaging of George
Bush'' ads that created a furor among consultants and columnists.
Too confusing, too elitist, they said of the spots, which showed
actors playing cynical Bush handlers trying to disguise their
candidate's alleged shortcomings.
   The Dukakis campaign maintains the ``packaging'' series served
its purpose by halting a slide in the polls. The series soon gave
way to more traditional attacks on Bush's record and judgment, plus
a well-received ad in which Dukakis speaks directly into the camera
about ``a father's concern'' for the future.
   Day care wasn't such a challenge, drugs weren't such a threat
when he raised his family, he tells viewers. Today, ``to stay even,
most families have to have two working parents. ... If I were a
young father today, I'd want to know that my government wasn't blind
to the changes in my life.''
   The dominance of television was highlighted by two commercials
that featured none other than, you guessed it, commercials.
   One, an upbeat musical spot for Bush, shows people watching
excerpts of upbeat Bush ads on TV. The other, perhaps more
reflective of the campaign's tone, shows Dukakis watching a Bush
attack ad. Dukakis snaps off the TV set in disgust. ``Full of lies
and he knows it,'' declares the Democrat. ``This isn't about defense
issues. It's about dragging the truth into the gutter.''

   President Reagan, proclaiming himself ``at
the end of a long political journey,'' pressed his case today for
the anointing of Vice President George Bush as his successor.
   ``All the progress we have made is on the line,'' Reagan said in
a speech prepared for delivery at a Republican rally at Macomb
Community College.
   With less than three days remaining before voters go to the
polls, Reagan warned, ``This election isn't over yet, not by a long
shot.''
   From this Detroit suburb, Reagan was traveling to Mesquite,
Texas, to speak in a rodeo arena.
   In his weekly radio address, Reagan also put in a no-holds-barred
plug for his vice president.
   ``Yes, my fellow Americans, there is a choice, a very important
choice _ a vote for George Bush is a vote for optimism ... It's an
endorsement of what we've done these past eight years,'' Reagan said.
   The president, who taped his address prior to departing on
Saturday's campaign swing, urged voters to pay attention to each and
every issue before them.
   ``There are ballot propositions on issues from gun control to the
size of cow stalls, and yes, everyone of these choices is vital,
every one is crucial. Every one gives you an opportunity to say,
this is what I want the future to look like. This is the country I
want to live in,'' Reagan said.
   The freedom to vote as one wishes is what separates America from
totalitarian regimes, where the elections are ``sick jokes,'' Reagan
said.
   ``Did you know that in the most recent election in the Stalinist
nation of Albania, the vote tally was 1,820,652 to one?'' Reagan
asked.
   On Monday, he returns for his third round of campaign appearances
in California, the richest prize with 47 electoral votes.
   ``We're now at the end of a long political journey that marks for
me my last campaign as an officeholder,'' Reagan said.
   ``I'm here today to bring home the simple fact that all the
progress we have made is on the line,'' he told his audience.
   ``Today's activities are part of a get-out-the vote campaign and
I just want to tell each one of you go to the polls on Tuesday and
get your friends to go too.''
   ``This election isn't over yet, not by a long shot, and as
Winston Churchill once said, we must continue the struggle until
victory is won,'' he said.
   His message about Bush's opponent, Michael Dukakis, and other
Democrats was the same as it has been:
   ``Whether it's their opposition to voluntary prayer in school,
support for gun control, or the left wing judges appointed in a
state like Massachusetts, or a weak-kneed defense policy: Their
views can only be described by the dreaded L-word: liberal, liberal,
liberal.''
   ``I just happen to think America is on a roll,'' Reagan said.
   Speaking at an open-air rally at a Voorhees Township, N.J.,
shopping mall Friday, Reagan said the voters' choice on Tuesday will
be ``just as clear'' as when they chose him over Jimmy Carter and
Walter Mondale.
   Reagan scoffed at Dukakis' stewardship in his three terms as
governor of Massachusetts.
   ``Between 1986 and 1987, while America as a whole was creating
more new jobs than the rest of the industrial world put together,
under the governor, his state ranked an abysmal 30th among our
states in the annual rate of total job growth,'' said the president,
himself the former governor of California.
   ``And with yesterday's papers reporting a state bank account
overdrawn by as much as $190 million for a month, the Massachusetts
mess is getting sloppier and sloppier by the day,'' he said.
   The president was referring to reports appearing Thursday that
the Massachusetts government was running a deficit and would have to
increase revenues or reduce spending to meet the state
constitutional requirement for a balanced budget.
   Heaping scorn on Dukakis' claim to crowds that he is ``on your
side,'' he said, ``Now, let me ask you _ biggest job growth in the
industrial world or one of the slower rates in the nation and a mess
like that; you tell me, who's on your side, the liberal governor or
George Bush?''
   ``Yes, the choice is just as clear as the choice in 1980 and
1984,'' he said, declaring that the Democrats offer ``liberal tax
and spend, economic stagnation, international weakness,'' while the
Republicans offer limited government, strong defense and firmness
with the Soviets.
   With Bush already ahead in New Jersey polls, Reagan also
campaigned for Senate candidate Pete Dawkins, an underdog in a
hard-fought race with Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg.

   A member of Vietnam's Parliament
predicted Saturday the United States and Vietnam will establish
diplomatic relations next year. He also said his country's
occupation of Cambodia has lasted too long.
   Nguyen Xuan Oanh made the comments to reporters after arriving in
the Philippines following a monthlong lecture tour in the United
States.
   Oanh also reported renewed efforts to resolve the fate of
American servicemen missing in Southeast Asia.
   ``I think that once the new government will be installed in
Washington, perhaps by mid-year or the end of next year we will
resume recognition of diplomatic relations between the United States
and Vietnam,'' said Oanh, a former South Vietnamese deputy prime
minister.
   During his U.S. visit, Oanh said he met with Reagan
Administration officials as well as members of Congress and
``received very encouraging and positive signs'' from them. He did
not name the people he met.
   Oanh also met with American businessmen during the visit, which
he said was part of a campaign to lure Western investment in
Vietnam. The nation is one of the poorest in the world and needs
American aid and investment that is now banned by a U.S. trade
embargo.
   Oanh said Vietnam is making progress in efforts to end its
10-year occupation of Cambodia.
   The country has promised to withdraw its 100,000 to 120,000
troops from Cambodia by the end of 1990, a condition Washington has
imposed before it will recognize the Hanoi government.
   Oanh said his government was setting up offices throughout
Vietnam for people to report any knowledge of missing American
soldiers. The information would then be used for a joint
U.S.-Vietnamese search for remains of missing American personnel, he
said.
   He said Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 to end massacres by the
Khmer Rouge government and attacks on Vietnamese communities along
the border between the two countries.
   ``But the mistake that we have done I think is that we have
stayed there too long,'' he said. ``Should we have withdrawn perhaps
a few years ago, we would not have provoked the kind of criticism
that we have now.''
   He said Vietnam is willing to withdraw all its troops from
Cambodia and allow a U.N. peacekeeping force to take over in
exchange for guarantees that the Khmer Rouge will not return to
power.
   Oanh served as a deputy prime minister of the U.S.-backed South
Vietnamese government and was jailed for a year after the capital,
Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, fell to the Communists in 1975.

<TEXT>
   A 45-year-old father of six has been
convicted of molesting and sodomizing two teen-age daughters for
half of their lives and faces a sentence of life in prison.
   The conviction of Edward R. Dickey ended a weeklong trial marked
by tearful testimony from the daughters, ages 18 and 16.
   Dickey, a roofing contractor, cross-examined his daughters
himself on the first day of the trial. The 18-year-old testified
that her father had fondled and molested her since she was 9; the
16-year-old said her father began molesting her at age 8.
   Deidre Lee Dickey, 18, cried Friday when the verdict was read and
said her father's conviction was too severe. ``I think it was real
unfair,'' Miss Dickey said. ``He doesn't deserve to be in there
(jail) _ I've been there.''
   In the pre-trial phase of the case, Judge Bryant Huff had jailed
Deidre Lee and her mother, Peggy Sue Dickey, for more than a week
for refusing to testify.
   During the trial, Huff repeatedly chastised Dickey, who was
acting as his co-counsel, for what the judge called attempts to slow
the pace of the trial.
   In his closing arguments, Dickey quoted Thomas Jefferson, George
Washington and Jesus Christ and claimed courts use ``the most
extreme form of psychological warfare to coerce children to give
false testimony to convict parents of sexual abuse.''
   Assistant District Attorney Don Johstono also quoted Jesus,
telling the jury in his summation, ``It is better to have a
millstone around your neck and be thrown into the sea than to lead a
child to sin.''
   He told the jury there had, indeed, been brainwashing but that it
had been done by Dickey and his wife, not the government.
   After deliberating for morre than three hours, the jury convicted
Dickey on eight counts of child molestation, aggravated child
molestation, sodomy and aggravated sodomy.
   Huff ordered Dickey held without bond until sentencing on
Thursday.
   Dickey could be sentenced to life in prison for the aggravated
sodomy conviction and more than 150 years in prison on the others.
   Dickey's wife said her husband likely would appeal the verdict.
   Her next fight, she said, will be to regain custody of her
children from Gwinnett County officials.
   All of the Dickeys' children except Deidre Lee, the oldest, are
in custody of the county social services agency. The couple's
16-year-old daughter, a younger daughter and two young sons are in
foster care. The couple's 13-year-old daughter is staying at the
county children's shelter.
   Dickey also was charged with molesting the 13-year-old daughter,
but prosecutors agreed to drop the charge to spare the girl the
trauma of testifying.
   Johstono said the verdict affirmed that Dickey, who had no prior
criminal record, was ``a very sick individual.''

   Tishomingo High School was leading 16-14
with seven seconds to go when tailback Shane Hill got the ball, ran
55 yards to the end zone, laid down and waited for the clock to run
out for a two-point safety.
   But it was the wrong end zone and the two points went to the
other school ... and that was exactly what the Tishomingo coach
wanted.
   Tishomingo needed a victory by four or more points over Falkner
High School to advance to the playoffs. So Tishomingo Coach David
Herbert weighed the chances of his team going 40 yards on one play
against Falkner's sturdy defense or making a long field goal.
   Finally he told his quarterback and son, Dave Herbert, to give
the ball to Hill for the two-point safety.
   It took the younger Herbert so much time talking his skeptical
teammates into the play that they were charged a five-yard delay of
game penalty.
   ``When Dave told them what we were going to do, one of our
tackles said, `Your daddy must be crazy,''' the coach said.
   But what Herbert's plan did was tie the score, 16-16, to put the
game into overtime and allow Tishomingo to win 22-16 and earn its
Class 1A playoff berth.
   ``(Hill's mother) turned to a friend and asked if her son had
gone crazy,'' the coach said of the surprise play. ``Both sides were
silent. They couldn't visualize someone going 55 yards the wrong way.
   ``I was watching (Falkner) Coach (Joe) Horton, and I think he
realized what our strategy was. I saw him take off his cap and throw
it on the ground.''

   Win or lose, Gov. Michael Dukakis won't soon
be forgotten by Shane Markovanovich.
   Markovanovich, 20, shelled out $80 Friday for a red, white and
blue tattoo of an eagle whose wings are the U.S. flag with the words
``Dukakis for president'' around it.
   ``I like what the guy stands for. He's out to help people, rich
or poor, and wants to balance the trade,'' Markovanovich said. ``I
just did it to make a statement.''
   Veronica Matelske, owner of the D&V Tattoo shop of Akron, said
the original price was $100, but she gave the warehouse worker a $20
discount. ``He comes in here a lot,'' she said.
   Dukakis joined the ranks of a leopard, the Grim Reaper, parrots,
eagle, bear and skulls on Markovanovich's skin.
   But despite the vote of confidence in Dukakis, Markovanovich says
he doesn't vote.

<HEAD>Alaska Voters Consider Fate of `Unqualified' Judge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Karl Johnstone has never been disciplined
or censured in his nine years as a judge, but he fears voters may
oust him from the bench on Tuesday because a state agency has
branded him unqualified.
   The agency's recommendation that voters remove the Anchorage
Superior Court judge has drawn attention to Alaska's unique system
of judicial review.
   Alaska is the only state with an official panel that reviews its
judges and publishes findings about their judicial fitness. In other
states, bar associations sometimes issue ratings.
   In the 12 years since the council began making recommendations,
Johnstone is the first Superior Court judge found unqualified. Only
four other judges, all from lower courts, have received the unwanted
distinction.
   ``The Alaska Judicial Council is used as a model for other
jurisdictions which are thinking about adopting some method to
evaluate judges already sitting on the bench,'' said Hal Brown, a
former state attorney general and the council's executive director.
   ``We have been told by the American Bar Association that we give
out more information than any other jurisdiction,'' Brown said.
``That's not to say our system is entirely satisfactory, because it
isn't.''
   Alaska's governor appoints judges from a short list of nominees
submitted by the council, but all state judges periodically go
before voters.
   The recommendations about judges up for retention are published
in the state voters' pamphlet and in most of the state's daily
newspapers.
   In Johnstone's case, he scored poorly in integrity, judicial
temperament and overall performance, especially as ranked by his
fellow jurists.
   He is the first judge since the surveys began who lawyers and
judges have scored less than acceptable in integrity. That, more
than anything else, led to the negative recommendation, Brown said.
   The council of three lawyers, three non-lawyers and the chief
justice of the state Supreme Court usually recommends retention. Of
the 17 judges up for retention Nov. 8, only Johnstone was found
unworthy of a ``yes'' vote.
   The recommendations are based on a review of court records,
complaints, findings of the state Judicial Conduct Commission,
interviews, investigations by the council staff, and surveys of
lawyers, judges, magistrates, police and probation officers.
   Anchorage lawyer Robert Erwin, a former state Supreme Court
justice, said it's unclear to voters what is meant by integrity.
   ``Are you talking about his honesty? Is his work not any good?
Are you talking about his character? The thing is, it's not
focused,'' Erwin said.
   ``When you talk about somebody's integrity, you really strike at
the core of his being,'' Erwin said. ``The implication, given the
intelligence of the people involved, is that there's something
horrendously wrong with Judge Johnstone or his colleagues wouldn't
vote this way.''
   Johnstone noted that his record as a judge and attorney is clean.
   ``I've never been sanctioned or disciplined or censured, either
privately or publicly, by the Judicial Conduct Commission, or by the
Alaska Bar Association when I practiced law,'' he said.
   He attributed his poor rating to some lawyers' dissatisfaction
with a program he started to speed the disposition of cases and make
attorneys more accountable.
   Erwin said the rating system encourages ``guilt by association.''
   ``The council can't say but in the most general terms what the
problem is, and then the accused can't defend himself,'' he said.
   Critics also say survey results often are based on a small number
of respondents and can be skewed by anonymous attorneys seeking
revenge against a judge.
   Brown pointed out that in the Johnstone survey, 528 attorneys and
judges and 103 police and probation officers responded.
   ``The people who are rating Judge Johnstone are giving it
thought, and in a sufficient number _ in my mind, at least _ that it
overcomes any real possibility of a conspiracy being engineered,''
he said.
   The verdict is not yet in on the effect of the council's
recommendations on voters. Of the four judges previously found
unqualified, two were ousted in their second retention election. The
other two were retained but later resigned.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says U.S. and Pakistan Ruining Geneva Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, stepping up
pressure on Afghan rebels to halt their advances, said Saturday the
agreement on Soviet withdrawal is near ruin because of U.S. and
Pakistani arms supplies to the insurgents.
   The statement to legislators in the Afghan capital, Kabul,
followed an announcement Friday that the Soviet Union had stopped
removing its soldiers from Afghanistan because of increased attacks
by Islamic guerrillas.
   Soviet SS-1 missiles and sophisticated MiG-27 warplanes also have
been sighted in Afghanistan in the past week.
   The concerted diplomatic and military pressure indicated the
guerrilla offensive against the pro-Soviet Afghan government has
pushed the Soviet Union past its level of tolerance.
   Yuli Vorontsov, the newly appointed Soviet ambassador, said the
supply of weapons to guerrillas by the United States and Pakistan
``is a very serious blow to the Geneva accords which practically
torpedoes them.''
   Vorontsov, in addition to being the ambassador to Afghanistan, is
a first deputy foreign minister with considerable influence and
experience negotiating the Red Army's exit from Afghanistan.
   Vorontsov spoke during a meeting of the foreign affairs
commissions of the two houses of the Afghan Parliament. His remarks
were carried by the Soviet news agency Tass.
   ``The time has come for a new international debate of all aspects
of the situation in Afghanistan and around it, because foreign
powers _ Pakistan and the United States _ are involved here that
push the opposition toward continuing the blood-letting,'' he said.
   Vorontsov said U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
could play an important role in any new debate on Afghanistan.
   Perez de Cuellar, in Geneva on Saturday for Iran-Iraq peace
talks, did not comment on the Afghanistan developments during brief
remarks to reporters.
   The United Nations helped negotiate the agreement signed in
Geneva in April that led to the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal.
The agreement was signed by the Soviet Union, United States,
Pakistan and Afghanistan.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan say the supplying of arms to the
Afghan rebels is a clear violation of the agreement.
   But diplomats say the United States and Soviet Union tacitly
agreed at the time of the signing that one side could continue
arming its client if the other did the same.
   In keeping with terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union withdrew
half of its 100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan between May 15-Aug.
15. The withdrawal is to be completed by Feb. 15.
   But Alexander Bessmertnykh, a first deputy foreign minister, told
reporters in Moscow on Friday the withdrawal was suspended for the
time being because of rebel bombings, mortar and rocket attacks.
   He also said the Soviet Union has sent fresh soldiers into
Afghanistan with more powerful weapons, but he said the quantity of
troops and weapons has not increased.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Soviet moves
``raise speculation that they aren't going to live up to the Geneva
accords.''
   Bessmertnykh said the Soviet Union still is committed to
withdrawing all its soldiers according to schedule, but added that
Soviet compliance with the Geneva accord depended on whether the
other signers obeyed it as well.
   That indicated the Soviets may be considering keeping soldiers in
the country after the Feb. 15 deadline.
   None of the national daily newspapers published Saturday reported
Bessmertnykh's comment that the troop withdrawal was suspended.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced
one pro-Soviet government with another and remained to fight the
insurgency. More than 13,000 of them died in the fighting.

   Two men handcuffed a bank executive to a

   Lloyd Smith, 46, an assistant manager at Citizens & Southern
National Bank of Plantation, said the armed kidnappers entered his
home early Friday and later drove him and his son to the bank.
   Smith said his captors handcuffed him to the suitcase and sent
him inside the bank. There, he placed between $100,000 and $150,000
in a bag. When he went back outside, he was intercepted by police
who were called by bank employees.
   Officers freed Smith from the suitcase, which was taken to a
remote site and later found to contain non-explosive flares taped
together, said Lt. Jeff Riffle. Smith's son, Vernon, was found
handcuffed in a nearby car and was freed unharmed.
   Police said they made no arrests and were seeking the two men who
fled without the money.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, after a vibrant and fractious and exciting
year, we will at last be going to the polls on Tuesday and
exercising our most important right _ the right to choose our future
_ the right to vote. There's nothing more glorious than the blessing
that is our God-given freedom to choose those who will lead us, and
there's no sight more moving than a lone American walking into that
voting booth casting a ballot in secret, and thereby determining the
destiny of this great country.
   And make no mistake, the choice this year at the top of the
ballot is crucial. Don't listen to the cynical pundits who tell you
this election isn't about the issues. Oh yes, it is. In fact, it's
about more than the issues. It's about the direction this country's
going to take over the next four years and beyond. It's about the
kind of economy we want, the kind of defense we want, the kind of
values we want. The choice is yours.
   But yes, my fellow Americans, there is a choice _ a very, very
important choice. A vote for Vice President George Bush is a vote
for optimism, an expression of faith in the American experiment.
It's an endorsement of what we've done these past eight years, and
of our heartfelt promise that tomorrow and the days to come will be
brighter still.
   No one knows better than a man who has sought the highest office
in this land what an awesome responsibility it is to be the vessel
of change, the selection of a people in control of their present and
their future. It's truly humbling. And I'd like once again to thank
all of you who placed your faith in me, and I'd like to tip my hat
to those who supported others, but their took their responsibility
as citizens of a democratic society seriously and with care. I have
heard your voices, like those before me and those after me. I have
heard your voices and I hope I have justified your faith.
   You know the two men who wish to succeed me on Tuesday. You know
also so many others _ tens of thousands of candidates on state and
local and school board ballots from Hawaii to Maine, and there are
ballot propositions on issues from gun control to the size of cow
stalls. And yes, every one of these choices is vital. Every one is
crucial. Every one gives you an opportunity to say, ``This is what I
want the future to look like. This is the country that I want to
live in.'' And I believe you must take every choice from county
sheriff to president of the United States with equal seriousness.
That's because our system depends upon you _ every single one of you.
   Alexander Hamilton, one of our founding fathers, said it best.
``No laws have any validity or binding force without the consent and
approbation of the people.'' Well, what we've learned in the course
of human history is that dictators may coerce and tyrants may
control, but the people who obey them do so only because there are
threatened with bodily harm to themselves or their families if they
do not. These societies are not just and they're not good. And
perhaps most telling, they do not work. They do not work because the
people have no voice; they have no say. Their elections are cynical
frauds, sick jokes.
   Did you know that in the most recent election in the Stalinist
nation of Albania, the vote tally was 1,820,652 to one. Yes, without
the fundamental freedom of the right to choose, hope disintegrates,
expectations for the future suffer, and life itself becomes gray and
dreary.
   And, that means a weak economy, low standards of living, high
infant mortality, and general gloom. Now, compare that kind of
society with the Democratic societies, where the last two centuries
have seen the expansion of opportunity and freedom, steady increases
in standards of living, and a constant belief that things will get
only better.
   And why? Because we who live in democracy are all our own
masters, and we know that the future is ours to build. And that the
only limits upon us, are those we place on ourselves.
   You can imagine how very moved I was last May to be in the Lenin
Hills, at a podium before an audience of students at Moscow State
University, speaking to them about the wonder and glory of human
freedom. Individual freedom. Think of those students, only if
they're very lucky and rise high in the communist party, will any
one of them ever have the influence on the course of their country's
history, and world history, that each of you can have just by going
into the voting booth.
   So, my fellow Americans, on Tuesday, breathe in the intoxicating
air of human freedom in every polling place and voting booth in the
nation, and reaffirm the words in the Declaration of Independence,
``All men are created equal.''
   Thank you, and until next week, God Bless You and God Bless
America.

   Jean-Pierre Stirbois, the No. 2 man
in the extreme-right National Front after party leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen, died Saturday in an automobile accident, police said. He was 43.
   Stirbois attended a political meeting Friday in the city of
Dreux, about 60 miles west of Paris, and was traveling toward the
capital when his car ran off the road and smashed into a tree at
about 2:40 a.m, police said.
   Stirbois was secretary-general of the National Front and a member
of the party leadership since 1981.
   He was born Jan. 30, 1945 in Paris, held degrees in law and
marketing and headed his own printing business.
   Stirbois was active in several extreme-right political movements
before joining the National Front in 1977.
   In 1982, he won 12.6 percent of the vote in local elections in
the district of Eure-et-Loir, west of Paris _ the highest vote
percentage in France for a right-wing candidate. A year and a half
later, he won the election for deputy mayor of Dreux.
   Stirbois was elected a deputy in the National Assembly in 1986.
He lost his seat in legislative elections last summer.
   The National Front, founded by Le Pen in 1972, is strongly
opposed to France's highly centralized and bureaucratic government
and is against personal taxes. It favors the death penalty, priority
to French citizens for jobs, and stopping immigration.
   In the first round of this year's presidential elections, Le Pen
won a surprising 14.4 percent of the vote, worrying many who feared
the National Front could awaken racist sentiments.

<HEAD>Texas Judge Reprimanded For Threatening Lawyers, Calling People
`Trash'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge allowed her child to run around her
courtroom during proceedings, called litigants and others ``pure
trash,'' and threatened to shoot a lawyer, says a state panel that
publicly reprimanded her.
   The reprimand issued Friday against District Judge Marsha Anthony
of Houston is the most severe action the State Commission on
Judicial Conduct can take short of removing a judge from the bench,
officials said.
   The commission's findings said Ms. Anthony had, among other
things, called people in her courtroom ``pure trash,'' left the
bench crying and shouting threats at attorneys, and told one lawyer
that she had a gun and could shoot two holes in his back before he
could leave the courtroom.
   ``The comments of Judge Anthony are not consistent with the
temperament required of a member of the judiciary,'' said the
commission's report, adding tha she ``brought discredit to the
judiciary.''
   Ms. Anthony was elected to the district court in 1984, and her
term expires Dec. 31. However, the commission said, ``it is not to
the benefit of the judiciary or the public to allow improper conduct
to go unsanctioned solely because of an approaching expiration of a
term.''
   Ms. Anthony was elected as a Republican in 1984 but ran in this
year's Democratic primary for a seat on the state Supreme Court. She
was defeated in March.
   According to the commission's report, signed by executive
director Robert C. Flowers, Ms. Anthony failed to respond to the
charges ``through personal interview, telephone communication and
hand-delivered written interrogatories.''
   The commission's report said the disciplinary panel concluded
that Ms. Anthony's cumulative actions constituted ``willful or
persistent conduct that (was) clearly inconsistent with the proper
performance of her duties.''
   Ms. Anthony could not be reached for comment. She wasn't in her
office Friday and a secretary said Saturday that the judge was not
expected until Monday. Her home number was not listed.
   As listed in the report, the commission's findings also included:
   _During a court proceeding, the judge failed to control the
actions of her 9-year-old son, who distracted lawyers, jurors and
herself ``by running around and crawling behind the judge's bench.''
   _Ms. Anthony told her son, in the presence of litigants and
others in the courtroom: ``Son, you see these people out here,
they're trash, they're pure trash, all of 'em.''
   _In one proceeding, she held a lawyer in contempt and told him
``to pay a fine to her favorite charity, i.e., a personal friend in
the hospital.''
   On Jan. 13, a jury acquitted Ms. Anthony of charges of
threatening a Kingwood woman and her son in a dispute over a child's
broken toy.
   Several bar associations have rated her the worst judge in Harris
County.
   Ms. Anthony is the judge whose temporary injunction propelled the
state's controversial ``no pass, no play'' statute regarding high
school athletics to the state Supreme Court, which ruled the law
constitutional.

   Part of a building in Frankfurt
collapsed Saturday while workers were tearing it down, and two
workers were buried and believed dead, officials said.
   Crews had already removed two stories of the office building,
which originally had eight floors, said fire department spokesman
Rolf Schoenfeld. Work had begun on the sixth floor when the ceiling
gave way.
   ``And then one ceiling after the other collapsed,'' Schoenfeld
said.
   The chain reaction collapsed one side of the building, leaving
about half of the concrete-and-steel structure still standing, he
said.
   Rescuers had begun looking for the two missing workers, but
Schoenfeld said there was little chance they survived.
   He did not say what kind of condition the building was in before
work began on it.

   A Midway Airlines Boeing 737 carrying more than

officials said.
   ``It was no big deal,'' said Sandy Allen, an airline spokeswoman.
``It was routine, not an emergency.''

   According to preliminary reports, Midway flight 795, en route to

Chicago.
   The plane took off at 12:43 a.m. and landed at Midway at 1:05

   U.S. District Judge Edward T. Gignoux, who
presided over a contempt trial involving the Chicago Seven, died
Friday after months of failing health. He was 72.
   The cause of death was not disclosed, but a friend said the judge
recently suffered from throat cancer.
   Gignoux was appointed to the U.S. District Court bench in 1957
and for 20 years was Maine's only federal judge. He often was in
demand for assignments outside the state, and twice was considered
for the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Gignoux received his greatest attention when Chief Justice Warren
Burger appointed him in 1973 to preside over the contempt trial of
Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale and the other defendants known as the
Chicago Seven.
   The 1960s radicals had been cited for contempt while on trial on
conspiracy charges for disturbances at the 1968 Democratic
Convention in Chicago. The others involved were Thomas Hayden, Jerry
Rubin, David Dellinger, Renard C. Davis, Lee Weiner and John Froines.
   Many of the contempt charges he dismissed, but he did find Rubin,
Hoffman, Dellinger and their lawyer, William Kunstler, guilty.
   The judge retired in 1983 but continued to hear cases as a senior
judge.

   Harold Martin, Air Marshal and one of the daredevil

War II, died Thursday. He was 70.
   Martin was born in Australia but was ruled unfit to fly in that
country because he suffered from asthma. He came to Britain and
became a bomber pilot.
   In 1943, he joined Squadron 617, dubbed the Dam Busters. Martin
and his comrades, all experts at low-level bombing, flew into a wall
of enemy fire at a height of only 60 feet in 1943 and bombed heavily
guarded dams to flood the industrial Ruhr Valley. Their exploits
were the subject of the 1954 movie ``The Dam Busters.''
   Martin's decorations included three separate awards of the
Distinguished Flying Cross, the highest Royal Air Force honor.

   Robert ``Evel'' Knievel and his wife owe the
U.S. government more than $5.3 million in taxes and penalties for
the years 1972-76, a federal judge says.
   Papers filed by the government in October 1987 said the Knievels
were $4.8 million in arrears in taxes, interest and penalties.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Hatfield of Great Falls took the case
last December after the Knievels failed within alloted time to file
an answer to a motion for a summary judgment, and he approved it
last week.
   Hatfield said in January that the Knievels' ``lack of response is
deemed an admission that, in the opinion of counsel for the
defendants, the motion is well taken.''
   The government first sued the former motorcycle stuntman and his
wife Linda for income tax liabilities in December 1983. Attempts to
negotiate a settlement failed and the government sought the judgment
in federal court.

   Rock singer John Fogerty spent two days on
the witness stand during his plagiarism trial, much of it with
guitar in hand, setting several jurors to swaying in their seats as
he played a series of his hits.
   The case brought by Fantasy Records was sent to the six-member
U.S. District Court jury late Friday. Deliberations begin Monday.
   Fogerty is accused of copying the melody of his 1970 Creedence
Clearwater Revival hit ``Run Through the Jungle'' when he wrote
``Old Man Down the Road,'' the lead single for his 1984 comeback
``Centerfield'' album. Fantasy owns the rights to the earlier song.
   ``He was aware of the fact that his stature as a star had been
eroded by the passage of time,'' Norman Rudman, a lawyer for Fantasy
Records, told the jury. ``The desire to succeed may stimulate a
desire to recapture the things he'd done before.''
   But Fogerty's lawyer, Kenneth Sidle, said Fogerty ``is a great
songwriter. He doesn't need to copy his old songs to come up with
good new songs.''
   Any similarities between the two songs were due to the fact that
they were ``written by the same person with the same musical style
and vocabulary,'' common to many of his past and present songs,
Sidle said.
   On the witness stand, Fogerty played several of his Creedence
Clearwater Revival hits _ ``Proud Mary,'' ``Green River,'' ``Down on
the Corner,'' ``Fortunate Son'' _ and described how he wrote them.

   Cosby announced the donation from him and his wife, Camille, at

   ``Mrs. Cosby and I have been blessed because I found a vein of

   A daughter of Cosby's attended Spelman, and episodes of his hit

   The donation, the largest in Spelman's 107 years, will be used
mostly to construct an academic center, doubling the college's
classroom space. The new building will also house a research center
dedicated to the works of black women.
   Cosby's donation was cheered loudly by 2,000 in attendance at

center is not built yet.
   ``I don't know how long it will take. All of the best intentions

<HEAD>Researcher Says Natural Toxin May Be Culprit In Dolphin Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A naturally occurring toxin is the focus of
research into an epidemic of dolphin deaths along the East Coast,
the lead investigator said Saturday.
   More than 800 dead and dying bottlenose dolphins, many with skin
lesions, washed ashore from New Jersey southward to Florida
beginning in June 1987. The last dead dolphin was spotted in Florida
in February.
   Researchers originally suspected a virus or bacteria, but are now
concentrating on toxins that could have poisoned the marine mammals,
said Dr. Joseph Geraci, professor of wildlife diseases at the
Ontario College of Veterinarian Medicine in Guelph, Canada. He
presented a report on his investigation at an Oceans '88 conference
here.
   He expects final conclusions in about six weeks.
   Geraci said that while high levels of pollutants and various
viruses were found in the dead dolphins' tissue, neither appears to
have killed them.
   ``(We) suspect that we are dealing with a point source, something
at sea that might have been a natural toxin or some other
pollutant,'' Geraci said.
   He said all the dolphins appear to have been poisoned in early
summer 1987.
   ``Some died right away, some lived long enough to become infected
with bacterias. Those animals languished for as long as six, eight
months after the initial event,'' he said.
   Most industrial pollutants have been tentatively ruled out and
scientists are concentrating on natural poisons, Geraci said. One
battery of tests for biological toxins found nothing but tests are
continuing, he said.
   The events that led to a rare red tide along the East Coast,
although not the red tide itself, may be to blame, the Canadian
scientist said.
   Red tides occur when microscopic algae become so populous that
the water appears stained red. In great concentrations they release
toxins that are deadly to some fish. And once in the food chain, the
toxins can harm other creatures, including man.
   While common on the west coast of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico,
red tides are almost unheard of on the East Coast, although in 1987
a red tide spread as far as North Carolina, killing shellfish there,
Geraci said.
   ``However, that event occurred in the first part of November,
whereas the dolphins were dying as early as June,'' he said.
   ``There may have been events that spawned this red tide on the
East Coast that were also associated with the mortality of the
dolphins,'' Geraci said. He declined to elaborate, saying that could
compromise the objectivity of the investigation.
   Warm water, calm seas, high nutrient levels, low salinity and
rainy periods followed by sunny weather are some of the factors that
contribute to red tides.
   ``The pattern of mortality, the extended time when it took place,
the geographic range: all lead us to suspect that we are dealing
with an agent or condition which these animals might have contacted
at about the same time in early summer of '87,'' Geraci said.

   Tens of thousands of screaming
protesters clashed with police throughout South Korea on Saturday,
demanding the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan on corruption
charges.
   Riot police in Seoul fired tear gas to block a 10,000-strong
crowd from marching to the former president's house. The protesters
brandished rocks and threw firebombs.
   At least 11 officers were injured, authorities said, including 10
hurt when a police station in Seoul was pelted with rocks and
firebombed. Dozens of protesters were seen injured and carried away,
but police gave no figures for the total number of injuries and
arrests.
   Tear gas filled the streets of seven other South Korea cities _
Wonju, Chunchon, Cheju, Kwangju, Taegu, Taejon and Pusan _ as police
fought students at anti-Chun rallies, authorities reported.
   The scandal over corruption allegedly committed by Chun and his
family has become the major political issue in South Korea since the
Summer Olympics in Seoul. On Saturday, three opposition groups
rejected a governing party offer for Chun to make a public apology
for his alleged misdeeds in office.
   Students in Seoul burned effigies of Chun, President Roh Tae-woo
and Uncle Sam, and thousands of citizens cheered and shouted
``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!''
   Roh was elected in December to replace Chun, who held office
seven years. The election followed months of anti-government
demonstrations.
   In Pusan, an opposition stronghold south of Seoul, police fired
tear gas at thousands of protesters trying to burn an effigy of the
former president after a street march, according to Yonhap, the
South Korean news agency.
   Police also battled groups of slogan-chanting protesters in
Kwangju, after students razed two police buses, shattered dozens of
windows and damaged eight cars in a firebomb attack on a government
prosecutors' building.
   One student was injured when he fell out of a third-floor window.
   In Seoul, police martial arts squads drove protesters into side
streets, beating and kicking them, but the protest swelled with
thousands of other citizens demanding Chun's arrest.
   Thousands of riot police using armored vehicles fired volleys of
tear gas at more than 15,000 protesters at one crowded shopping area.
   At least 10 police officers were hurt when students hurled rocks
and scores of firebombs into a police station in Seoul.
   A police officer was injured on the southern outskirts of Seoul
when students attacked an office of the governing Democratic Justice
Party with firebombs.
   During the Seoul rally Saturday, dissident leaders called for
bigger rallies next week and vowed to attack Chun's house.
   Radical students have launched attacks on government buildings
and party offices since Thursday, when riot police blocked a march
to Chun's home by thousands of students.
   The governing party, in a move aimed at ending the protests,
proposed Saturday that Chun apologize or respond to allegations of
corruption and misrule, but opposition leaders rejected the offer
and demanded an investigation.
   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was recently sentenced
to seven years' in prison for taking bribes and misusing millions of
dollars in government money while he headed a rural development
program.
   Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980, also is being
investigated for his alleged role in putting down a 1980 civil
uprising in Kwangju. By official count, about 200 people died in the
military suppression of the nine-day uprising.
   Roh, a former military general and a friend of Chun, arrived in
Australia on Saturday to begin a four-day visit and did not comment
on the disturbances.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address, delivered by Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Tex., the Democratic vice presidential candidate:
   Good afternoon. My name is Lloyd Bentsen and I'm the Democratic
candidate for vice president. It's my job to deliver the official
response of my party to President Reagan, and that's a difficult
assignment. Even though he's been out campaigning for our opponents,
I think every American wishes President Reagan well as he nears the
end of his presidency. And even though President Reagan is trying to
lend George Bush a helping hand, I'll bet he's been disappointed in
the behavior of those who now carry the Republican banner.
   A presidential campaign should be a magic moment for America. A
time when we're proud of ourselves as a democracy because we're
proud of our candidates. There hasn't been much about the campaign
of George Bush and Dan Quayle that would make any American proud.
They spent millions of dollars, your tax dollars, to raise false
fears and make you believe this election is about phony issues. They
hired the best political hit men Republican money can buy and they
set out to assassinate the character of Governor Michael Dukakis, my
running mate.
   I think democracy is too fragile, America too special for us to
reward that kind of negative campaigning. We can't elect a candidate
who is trying to divide America into its lowest common denominator.
The Republicans want you to believe this election is about right and
left. Mike Dukakis and I say it's about right and wrong and who's
really on your side. We say it's wrong for the Republicans to duck
the issues and distort the truth. We say the best America solves
problems, creates opportunity and fights hard for working men and
women who have suffered from eight years of Republican indifference.
   When it comes to issues of concern to the middle-income folks in
America, we're right and the Republicans are wrong. We're on your
side and they are not. Mike Dukakis and I are right when we say a
college education should be a right and not a privilege for every
qualified high school graduate. We have a college loan program to
make that dream a reality. We're on your side when we say America
needs a government that will stand up and fight hard for American
jobs and American products.
   We're right when we say countries enjoying full access to our
markets must give us full access to their markets. Mike Dukakis and
I are on your side when we pledge never to cut your Social Security
benefits and to protect programs like Medicare. We are right when we
say trade and budget deficits just have to be reduced. We are on
your side when we offer programs to help young couples save for that
first home. We're right when we tell you how we'll provide health
insurance for 37 million Americans who lack coverage and live in
terror of illness and financial ruin.
   We are right when we demand justice in the Justice Department and
when we demand competence, not contempt for government service.
George Bush and Dan Quayle are wrong, dead wrong when they turn
their backs on issues of concern to middle-income America and tell
you that this country can toast into the future with the status quo.
If we permit this election to be decided by the mudslingers and the
truth-twisters, we'll do a grave disservice to our democracy. We'll
set a dangerous precedent and put America on notice that when it
comes to choosing a president, anything goes and the truth really
doesn't matter.
   When you walk into that voting booth on Tuesday, stop for a
moment. Consider the issues that really matter to you: education,
health care, good jobs at good wages, making America number one in
the world. Ask yourself if Dan Quayle is really qualified to be
president. Ask yourself if America can do better. And if your answer
is yes, vote for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen because we're on
your side.
   Mike Dukakis has said the best America is yet to come and I
believe that. We're fortunate to live in the greatest nation on
earth and one reason for its greatness is that all our citizens
possess that precious right to vote. We've done well in this
country, but together we can do better. And I believe the best
America will come when we go to the polls on November the 8th and
elect Mike Dukakis President of the United States of America.

   A man angry about the marriage of his
stepdaughter shot and killed his son-in-law with a semiautomatic
pistol shortly after the couple told him about the wedding, police
said Saturday.
   Thomas A. Kemp, 44, was held without bail in Mahoning County
Jail; police said charges would be filed Monday.
   Kemp was held in the death of Thomas A. Beno, 43. The two men had
been feuding for some time, Police Lt. Robert Rupp said.
   Beno and Lorie D. Elder, 32, were married Friday morning but did
not tell Kemp or his wife, Bonnie, of the wedding until after the
ceremony, Rupp said.
   The new husband called Kemp to inform him of the marriage, and
the newlyweds went to Kemp's house, the lieutenant said.
   During the two couples' conversation at the dining room table,
Rupp said, Kemp went to the kitchen and got a 9mm semiautomatic
pistol. Kemp's wife and the newlywed couple fled, but Kemp opened
fire on Beno, Rupp said.
   After the shooting, Kemp put down the gun and called police.

   A law that would boost the power of Israel's
Orthodox religious establishment but alienate many American Jews has
a good chance of passage in the new Parliament, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said Saturday.
   Also Saturday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said his
left-of-center Labor Party might join a coalition with Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc if Labor fails to form a government with
religious parties.
   ``A rightist-religious coalition will bring terrible things to
this country,'' Rabin told Israel TV. ``In view of our national
responsibility, I don't rule out ... a broad-based government under
certain conditions that would enable us to attain our goals in the
areas of diplomacy and security.''
   Likud leaders have said they would not accept Labor as a
coalition partner s long as Labor insists on an international Middle
East peace conference.
   Both Likud and Labor have negotiatiated separately with Orthodox
and ultra-Orthodox parties about possibly forming a governing
coalition in the Knesset, or parliament.
   The so-called ``Who Is A Jew'' law is a key demand by the
religious parties.
   It would give Orthodox rabbis sole authority to validate
conversions to Judaism. It has been denounced as discriminatory by
American Jews, most of whom are affiliated with the Reform and
Conservative movements of Judaism.
   ```Before every vote on some religious law, there is a big noise
among American Jews,'' Shamir said in an interview on Israel radio.
``I'm convinced we'll reach some understanding with the American
Jews.''
   In Tuesday's election, Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member
chamber but needs the mandates of the religious parties and three
extreme right-wing parties to form a majority.
   The Labor Party, which won 39 seats, has held coalition talks
with the religious parties, but its chances of forming a government
with them are considered slim.
   Most Likud legislators, including Shamir, backed the ``Who Is A
Jew'' proposal when it was put to a vote last year and narrowly
defeated.
   ``If there are now more parliament members who agree to this
(law), there are more chances that it will pass,'' Shamir said in
the radio interview.
   Existing law defines Jews as those born to a Jewish mother or
converted to Judaism. It recognizes conversions by all three
branches of Judaism, but Orthodox rabbis argue that only their
conversions are valid. They want the law to be changed to read
``converted to Judaism according to Orthodox law.''
   ``Should we have non-Jews among us registered as Jews, which is
of course a lie?'' Avner Shaki, head of the National Religious
Party, said on Israel radio.
   The proposed law would not affect most Conservative or Reform
Jews, but members of the two movements have said it would
symbolically expel them from the Jewish fold.
   ``Shamir is ready to give (the religious parties) as much as they
want,'' said Shulamit Aloni, head of the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement, in an interview on Israel radio. ``They can change our
lives, lock us in at home on Saturdays and holidays.''
   But Shamir dismissed fears by secular Israelis that the Likud
would make too many concessions to the religious parties, which also
demand a ban on driving, movies and soccer on the Jewish Sabbath.
   ``I don't foresee any decisive chances,'' Shamir said. ``Everyone
will be able to continue to live as he does now.''
   Secular Israelis make up about two-thirds of the population.

<HEAD>Woman Can Sue Hospital For ``Outrageous Conduct''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kentucky Court of Appeals has cleared
the way for trial on a lawsuit filed by a woman who had to deliver
her own stillborn fetus and seeks damages from a hospital for
``outrageous conduct.''
   Pamela V. Seitz says she delivered the child into a bedpan on
March 11, 1985, at Humana Hospital-University of Louisville with the
assistance of only a roommate.
   She alleged that for 15 to 20 minutes she and the roommate had
been unable to get hospital personnel to assist them and that the
nursing staff had intentionally de-activated her intercom buzzer
after she used it several times to complain of pain.
   When a nurse finally arrived at the room after the birth, Ms.
Seitz and the roommate contend, the nurse yelled at Ms. Seitz, who
was hysterical, to ``shut up, as she was disturbing other
patients,'' the Court of Appeals said in its opinion Friday.
   David Monohan, a lawyer for Humana, acknowledged that the nurse
used ``harsh words,'' but said she did so only to calm the patient
in order to determine what had happened and later apologized.
   Monohan said there was ``absolutely no evidence'' that the buzzer
had been disconnected, and said nurses responded in ``15 to 20
seconds'' after they heard Ms. Seitz's screams.
   Ms. Seitz, who had two previous miscarriages and had a high-risk
pregnancy, doesn't contend that Humana was responsible for her
baby's death. ``Our complaint is with how she was treated,'' said
her lawyer, Ken Sales.
   Monohan said Ms. Seitz was in a regular patient room, rather than
the hospital's obstetrical section, on the advice of her doctor.
   ``Unexpected premature expulsions of the fetus can happen without
the ability of anyone to predict it,'' Monohan said. ``No one did a
thing wrong.''
   Writing for the Court of Appeals, Judge Boyce Clayton took no
position on the truth of Ms. Seitz's claims, but said she had
presented enough evidence to meet the threshold for trying to prove
``outrageous conduct.''
   Under Kentucky law plaintiffs may recover damages for conduct
``outrageous in the extreme'' even if they haven't been physically
injured.
   The Court of Appeals said plaintiffs must show they suffered
severe emotional distress, rather than mere ``bad manners or hurt
feelings.''
   They also must prove the wrongdoer's conduct so ``intolerable it
offends against generally accepted standards of decency and
morality.''
   The opinion reversed a Jefferson Circuit Court ruling.

<TEXT>
   At times, Margaret Thatcher seemed more
like a politician on the campaign trail than a prime minister on an
official visit when citizens of this Communist state flocked to see
the British leader.
   During last week's three-day visit, Polish workers battling for a
free trade union welcomed as a hero the staunchly anti-Communist
leader who has battered British labor unions and axed thousands of
jobs to cut losses in coal mines, shipyards and steel mills.
   The Communist government also gave her red carpet treatment.
   But Gerald Kaufman, a spokesman for Britain's socialist
opposition Labor Party, accused Mrs. Thatcher of turning the visit
``into a hypocritical ego trip.''
   ``In Poland she has held a dialogue with trade unionists, oozing
syrupy pseudo-sympathy. In Britain she tramples on trade unionists
and never has any dialogue with them,'' he said Saturday.
   ``In Poland she associates with men fighting to keep a shipyard
open. In Britain she shuts most of our shipyards down,'' he said.
   Her visit began two days after Poland's leaders announced they
will shut down Gdansk's money-losing Lenin Shipyard Dec. 1.
   She distanced herself from Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski's
admiring references to her own tough line with labor unions and
closures of money-losing enterprises.
   ``The situation was completely different. We were elected to stop
abuses of power by trade union leaders in a democracy,'' aides
quoted her as telling Jaruzelski.
   Mrs. Thatcher got a rousing welcome from about 20,000 people
Friday in Gdansk when she became the first Western head of state to
meet Lech Walesa in the heartland of his banned Solidarity labor
movement.
   Solidarity loved her for telling Gen. Jaruzelski at a banquet
that he must negotiate with the union and other opposition groups as
the price for long-term financial aid from the West.
   He responded coolly.
   Their joint public engagements had an air of formal correctness.
   But the commemorations at monuments to those who died in World
War II _ the sober-faced Jaruzelski in military uniform and the
prime minister in a black coat and hat _ were more than rituals.
   Both leaders recalled that Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939
triggered World War II with the British declaration of war on
Germany and praised the gallantry of Poles who fought in the British
armed services.
   She stopped business during a Warsaw market trip that was
reminiscent of an election-time visit.
   In Gdansk, she looked near tears at a service in the shipyard's
Roman Catholic parish church, St. Brygida, as the congregation
joined in a Polish national hymn, their arms raised in the
Solidarity victory sign.
   Mrs. Thatcher dodged reporters' questions about her views of the
shipyard closure, but she told Walesa: ``It is apparent that no one
can stop you.''
   Jaruzelski added an informal touch which aides said delighted
Mrs. Thatcher.
   He unexpectedly came to Warsaw Airport to see her off Friday
night and sent two bouquets of flowers to her plane.

   Gov. Ngiratkel Etpison of Ngatpang State took
the lead Saturday in the crowded race for Palau's presidency as his
district's votes were counted in the slow tally of ballots from
Wednesday's national elections.
   Etpison, a businessman, had 1,235 votes to edge ahead of
businessman Roman Tmetuchl, who had 1,115 votes when the Palau
Election Commission suspended counting Saturday while Typhoon Skip
passed about 175 miles north of Koror, capital of this tiny,
isolated western Pacific island chain.
   The storm cause no major problems, although there were sporadic
power outages in Koror, according to the National Emergency
Management Office here.
   The tabulation of ballots was expected to resume Sunday,
officials said.
   Incumbent President Thomas O. Remengesau has been running third
in the seven-man race.
   Remengesau took over as president in August to fill ot the term
of Palau's second president, Lazarus Salii, who shot and killed
himself at his home.
   Etpison was recruited by the Ta Belau party as its standard
bearer after Salii's death.
   Next to be counted are the large number of ballots from voters
registered in their hometowns but who cast their ballots in Koror.
   Election commission officials estimated abut 80 percent of
Palau's 11,173 registered voters cast ballots in the election.

<HEAD>Sheriff's Department Defends Use Of Padded Jail Cells</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge says the Orange County jail
insulted human decency by housing naked inmates in unsanitary padded
cells, but the sheriff's department says the dozen padded cells are
necessary and used properly.
   ``Our philosophy is to treat inmates with dignity,'' Assistant
Sheriff John Hewitt said Friday at a news conference. ``The cells
are always clean and they are properly used. We provide the finest
care we can for them.''
   U.S. District Judge William Gray has ordered that inmates put
into the cells be given bedding, cloth gowns, toilet paper and
access to washing facilities.
   Gray issued the order Wednesday in a lawsuit filed Oct. 8 by the
American Civil Liberties Union. He said housing naked inmates in
unsanitary conditions was an insult to human decency.
   The lawsuit claimed the padded cells were unfit to live in and
were used to improperly punish inmates.
   ``They are the best alternative for the unfortunates who are
suffering mental disturbances that are dangerous to themselves or
other people,'' Hewitt said.
   The judge's order reaffirmed existing policies for the cells,
said Dr. Eugene Dorsey, director of the psychiatric unit. He said
inmates put in the cells receive medical evaluations and approval is
sought from a psychiatrist.
   ``We have no quarrel with Gray's order,'' Dorsey said. ``More
clothing and amenities are something we can comply with. But I think
it's sometimes safer not to give the individual something they could
strangle themselves with.''
   A different picture was described by a doctor who worked in the
jail from April 1987 to August 1988.
   ``Every time I walked into one of those cells there was vomit,
urine and filth on the floor,'' Dr. Manuel Perez-Pabon said. He
testified that the cells were ``something out of a detention-camp
movie.''

<HEAD>Democrats: Issueless Presidential Campaign Leaves Mandate To
Congress</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 6-7 with 2 grafs to supply first names for Bush and
Dukakis.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

   Democrats are so confident they'll do well in
Tuesday's House and Senate races that they are throwing down the
gauntlet for the next president already, saying they _ not the White
House _ will have the mandate to chart America's course for the next
four years.
   Behind that confidence is the likelihood of Democratic advances
in the Senate and perhaps the House, plus the perception that the
presidential candidates have done little to define a clear vision of
what should happen after Election Day.
   In the current arithmetic, it appears likely Democrats will pad
their 54-46 Senate advantage by one or two seats. House Democrats
will remain dominant as well, perhaps adding a small handful of
seats to their current 255-177 majority.
   But both sides also are prepared for surprises. ``I've never seen
the electorate as volatile as it is right now,'' says Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
   Presidential mandates are created when a president makes a
persuasive case, based on a clear Election Day tide, that his
victory amounts to a popular directive to pursue certain policies.
   ``There's not a prayer of a chance that Congress will accept any
definition of a (George) Bush mandate,'' said Thomas Mann, a
political analyst at the Brookings Institution. A more solidly
Democratic Congress is also likely to deny Bush, if he wins, the
traditional honeymoon period of cooperation.
   A victory for Michael Dukakis would bring less friction, but
eking out a come-from-behind win is not the stuff of which mandates
are made.
   ``Whether Bush wins or not, there is a very clear commitment to
continue what Congress started two years ago _ addressing trade,
health care ... issues that have been ignored,'' Kerry said.
   Instead of resembling 1980, when Reagan was swept into office
along with a Republican majority in the Senate, the next two years
are more likely to look like the last two, when Reagan was a lame
duck and Congress largely set the national agenda, Mann said.
   ``The way to think about this is not as the president leading
Congress, but of the two as truly equal partners, seeking
accommodation and negotiation'' he said. ``If Bush adopts that mode
and demonstrates some flexibility, then he can get some things
done.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee,
made it clear on the campaign trail last week that Bush, if elected,
will be unable to expect much deference from Capitol Hill.
   ``I don't see how a president has any kind of mandate if he wins
by negative advertising,'' said Bentsen, who is virtually certain to
be re-elected to his Texas Senate seat regardless of what happens in
the presidential race.
   Polls, too, are showing that voters are unhappy with the choices
for president and want to Congress to have a strong balancing role.
A Wall Street Journal@NBC poll published Oct. 28 showed that by a
22-point margin, voters prefer to have the White House and Congress
controlled by different political parties.
   In both the Senate and House, a pro-incumbent bias helps
Democrats.
   Fifteen Democratic senators are seeking re-election, and all but
two _ John Melcher in Montana and Frank Lautenberg in New Jersey _
are considered relatively safe. A dozen Republican senators are
facing the voters. One, David Karnes of Nebraska, trails badly in
the polls. Two others, Chic Hecht of Nevada and Lowell Weicker of
Connecticut, are locked in dead-heat struggles to hold on.
   There are six ``open'' seats, where no incumbent is seeking
re-election; each party currently controls three.
   One GOP seat, Virginia, is regarded as certain to switch to the
Democratic column for former Gov. Charles Robb. Rep. James Jeffords
is expected to hold the Vermont Republican seat for his party. The
Democrats appear likely to lose one of their open seats, in
Mississippi, to GOP Rep. Trent Lott, and to hold onto another,
Wisconsin, where millionaire businessman Herb Kohl has bought enough
television time to make himself well known.
   Two open seats, the Florida Democratic slot and the Washington
state Republican one, remain toss-ups and will be the most closely
watched contests on election night.
   Kerry said a late surge by Dukakis was helping Democrats,
particularly by generating enthusiasm that would help motivate
voters to the polls. The get-out-the vote boost would be especially
helpful among black voters, many of whom have harbored resentment
toward the party over what they regard as ill treatment of their
favorite candidate, the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Republicans, meanwhile, were hoping Bush's lead in states like
Florida, New Jersey and Mississippi would help their Senate
candidates. In Florida, GOP candidate Connie Mack was airing a TV
spot in which Bush endorses him.
   ``We're more enthusiastic about our chances than we have been at
any time in the cycle,'' said Tom Mason, spokesman for the National
Republican Senatorial Committee. While he conceded the possibility
the GOP might lose a couple of seats, Mason added: ``We could just
as easily be plus two or better.''
   In the House, incumbency remained the most potent force at work
in campaigns. It appeared likely that as in past years, nine out of
10 sitting lawmakers will be returned to office.
   Of 27 open seats which were the most open to party turnover,
Republicans hold 15 and Democrats hold 12, giving Democrats the
mathematical edge for possible pickups. Another 70 incumbent races
considered reasonably close are split about evenly between the two
parties.

<DATELINE>MALE, Maldives (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this usually placid nation of
palm-fringed tropical islands, people are trying to come to grips
with a violent intrusion that left scores dead.
   ``I never thought I would see a man in combat in my life,'' Hasan
Malik, a 29-year-old diving instructor, said Saturday.
   ``I heard gunshots for the first time,'' said Amir Abdullah, who
works in his father's cafe on Male's main street. ``I didn't know
what had happened.''
   Two days after gunmen tried to overthrow the government,
bloodstains still marked the ground outside the presidential palace
and the National Security Services building, headquarters of the
1,200-man force that is the country's only defense organization.
   While rain drizzled down, members of the force patrolled Male's
gray sand streets in jeeps and on motorcycles. Outside the capital
city of one- and two-story white brick homes, Indian paratroopers
could be seen.
   But the tuna trawlers that had stayed out of sight since the
failed coup again docked at Male's jetty.
   By evening, people thronged Male's streets to buy freshly caught
fish from the trawlers. They carried the big fish home in their arms
and on the handlebars of their bicycles, the main mode of land
transportation.
   ``The Maldives are normally a very peaceful, quiet place. We are
all as brothers,'' said businessman Redeem Mohammad Didi.
   The economy of the overwhelmingly Moslem nation depends largely
on fishing and tourism. Special islands have been set aside for
tourists, where they drink the alcoholic beverages forbidden to the
182,000 Maldivians under Islamic law.
   Tourists seemed largely untouched by Thursday's attempt to
overthrow President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and by the news that about
30 people died. The gunmen fled after Indian paratroopers arrived.
   ``We came to know about the coup only 12 hours after the
mercenaries landed,'' said Lars Granlof of Sundstahl, Sweden.
   Granlof, a radio journalist, and his wife were staying at the
Kurumba Village Beach Resort on an island five miles from the Male
atoll.
   ``The tourists did what they came to do,'' said Raheem Murad, an
Indian on a business trip. ``We are cut off and life here was
totally normal.''
   Some tourists were upset because their departures were delayed
when the attack prompted officials to close the airport to
commercial traffic.
   ``I have stayed three days extra here with my family,'' said
Satya Prakesh, who wanted to return to India where he works for
Indian Airlines. ``I am paying 500 rupees ($34) a day room rent.''
   That was relatively cheap, though. Many of the beach resorts cost
between $100 and $200 a night.

   A state Senate candidate in hot water for
referring to a lawmaker campaigning for his opponent as a
``streetwalker'' says he was talking about politicking, not the
other business.
   Robert Miller, a Republican seeking to regain his seat from
Democratic Sen. James Maloney, said he wasn't saying Rep. Edith
Prague was a prostitute when he said Thursday that Maloney ``has the
streetwalker with him.''
   ``I was talking about stumping,'' Miller explained. ``You know
what that means, stumping? As a matter of fact, I'm going out to
streetwalk myself very shortly.''
   That explanation from Miller, who also referred to her as a
``street lady,'' didn't satisfy Prague.
   ``It's an insult to any woman to be called a streetwalker or a
street lady,'' she said. ``The people should know the quality of
that candidate. Nobody calls a respectable woman a street lady or a
streetwalker. Nobody.''
   ``Stumping'' dates from olden days in U.S. politics, when
campaigners in backwoods districts orated from the stumps of felled
trees.

   Sen. Dan Quayle ridiculed Michael
Dukakis' ``on-your-side'' campaign pitch Saturday, saying the
Democratic can't admit that the Republican Party has been been
``fighting for the people all along.''
   ``Now I would ask you, who's on the side of the American people?
George Bush,'' Quayle told a crowd gathered in the West Virginia
state capitol building.
   Quayle, the No. 2 man on the GOP ticket, said the Reagan
administration created jobs and cut tax rates while bringing about a
post-recession economic recovery that has stretched into its 71st
month.
   ``Ronald Reagan and George Bush saved America from decline,'' he
told the crowd, many yelling and waving miniature flags.
   Boarding his campaign plane on a rainy morning at the start of a
modest schedule of weekend appearances in Maryland, Virginia and
West Virginia, Quayle said earlier that he did not think Dukakis
would score major points with his populist appeal of recent days.
   He did acknowledge polling figures indicating that Dukakis is
narrowing Bush's lead in public opinion.
   ``We've said all along it's going to be a close race, right down
to the wire,'' he said. And Quayle conceded that ``I'm sure there
are some nervous nellies in the (GOP) campaign.'' But he added,
``George Bush is not jittery. Dan Quayle is not jittery.''
   ``There'll be three, long hard days until the American people
tell us who the next president of United States will be,'' he told
some 250 gathered in an ornate, columned hall fronting the West
Virginia Senate chamber in the capitol building.
   Quayle was accompanied on Saturday's trip by his wife, Marilyn,
and his three children, Tucker, 14, Benjamin, celebrating his 12th
birthday, and Corinne, 9.
   He toured a GOP campaign headquarters in Timonium, Md., later,
made some phone calls to undecided voters and mixed with people at
the Valley View Farms nearby. ``Attention shoppers: Dan Quayle has
arrived and will be here soon,'' a voice barked over a public
address system at the outdoor shopping mart.
   During the Charleston event, Quayle was heckled at various
intervals by a small band of pro-Dukakis supporters.
   When Quayle told the rally that he had had ``a lot of fun''
talking about Dukakis' resume, a young man shouted, ``What about
your resume?''
   Scoffing at Dukakis' populist campaign pitch to voters that he's
``on your side'' and the Republicans are ``on their side,'' Quayle
rattled off a host of government economic statistics that he said
showed the GOP on the side of average people.
   He cited the latest civilian unemployment report, released
Friday, which fell to 5.3 percent, the lowest since 1974.
   ``We're on their side and we've been fighting for the people all
along,'' he said.
   Quayle defended his relatively light weekend schedule of campaign
appearances, telling reporters that ``it wouldn't make any
difference if I had two or 16 events. The American people are going
to focus on the top of the ticket these last ... days and see which
person they want to have as the president of the United States.''

   President Chadli Bendjedid on Saturday
appointed a former military chief to be the new premier after
Algerians approved reforms giving the premier greater power in
governing the nation.
   Kasdi Merbah replaces Abdelhamid Brahimi as premier, according to
a statement from the president's office. Merbah will appoint a new
government.
   In a referendum Thursday, Algerians overwhelmingly approved
changes to the constitution aimed at reducing the power of the
ruling National Liberation Front, the sole legal party in this North
African nation of 25 million.
   The referendum grants the premier greater powers _ which are now
wielded mostly by the president through a Soviet-style central
control _ and makes him responsible to the National Assembly, or
parliament.
   Last month, Algerians took to the streets to protest their
declining standard of living, food shortages and lack of jobs.
Demonstrations in Algiers and provincial towns became violent,
troops moved in and 176 people died in six days, according to
official count.
   The rioting ended when Bendjedid promised political and economic
reforms, including the referendum and a government shake-up.
   ``(Merbah) is known as a can-do guy,'' said one Western diplomat,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``(He) is objective-oriented
and reform-minded. He may be just the guy to oversee the changes
Bendjedid is planning.''
   Merbah, who has kept a low profile in the state-controlled press,
has a reputation among Algerians for integrity and honesty.
   The 50-year-old premier fought in Algeria's war of liberation
against the French colonizers in the 1950s. After Algerian
independence in 1962, Merbah was made an army colonel and was
appointed director of national defense. He was among the officers
who led the June 19, 1965, coup that ousted President Ahmed Ben
Bella.
   The new president, Houari Boumedienne, made Merbah chief of
military security, the country's most powerful police force.
   Merbah was credited with tipping the balance among the military
officers who brought Bendjedid to power in 1979 after Boumedienne's
death. Bendjedid named Merbah secretary-general of defense and, in
1980, vice-minister of defense.
   Since 1984, Merbah held a series of offices, including minister
of industry, minister of agriculture and minister of health.
   As agriculture minister, Mesbah oversaw the conversion of
Algeria's enormous state farms to small, private collectives _ one
of Algeria's more successful attempts at making the economy more
efficient and productive.
   The new government faces an economic crisis brought on by the
plummeting prices of petroleum products, which represent 97 percent
of the country's export earnings.
   Sources close to the government, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Benjedid is planning a modified form of
privatization for some industries and also hopes to find ways of
diversifying the economy.

   A ``virus'' that clogged computers across the
country probably was created without malice or intent to cause
damage, school officials and associates of the student suspected of
creating it said Saturday.
   If Cornell University graduate student Robert T. Morris, 23, was
the source of the virus last week, he had enough computer savvy that
he could have caused catastrophic damage to the network the virus
invaded, fellow students said.
   ``He's very clever, very intelligent,'' said Cornell computer
student David Baraff, who said he has known Morris since they both
worked a summer at AT&T's Bell Laboratories. ``Even in high school
he was already good at this stuff.''
   ``If he had wanted it (the virus) to be malicious, it would have
been really malicious,'' Baraff said.
   While the virus program kept computers extremely busy and jammed
their memories by ordering the machines to replicate itself, it
destroyed no data, officials at effected centers said. It eventually
affected about 6,000 computers at military and civilian research
centers.
   Other than his reputation as an accomplished hacker, Morris has
been virtually nameless and faceless in the two months since he
entered Cornell's doctorate computer science program, students said.
   The New York Times quoted sources as identifying Morris as the
creator of the virus.
   ``He was quiet and always working on things,'' said student Kevin
Asplen. ``Maybe this is what he was working on.''
   Morris, a first-year student in the graduate computer science
program, ``would just be programming all the time, though I don't
really know what he was working on,'' said student Richard Chapman,
who said he worked at a terminal near Morris' in one of their
classes.
   Other students in the same class said they could not even
remember what Morris looks like.
   ``I wouldn't even be able to tell you who he is,'' student James
Allen said.
   Given the nature of computer science, where work is generally
done alone at a terminal, it's not unusual for students to remain
aloof, students said.
   The skills to break into Arpanet, the Defense
Department-supported network into which Morris allegedly unleashed
the virus from Cornell's computer system, also are not unusual,
students said.
   ``I would presume we would all be considered quite good
hackers,'' graduate student Paul Stodghill said. He shares an office
with Morris but said he rarely has seen him there.
   But Morris was a little better at hacking _ unauthorized
manipulation of computers _ than others, associates said.
   Morris was highly recommended to Cornell by his undergraduate
professors at Harvard University, but more for his practical
computer skills than his academic record, according to his adviser,
Cornell instructor Dexter Kozen.
   If the virus is traced to Morris, ``appropriate disciplinary
action'' will be taken, said M. Stuart Lynn, Cornell's vice
president for information technologies. He would not give details on
what actions might be taken.
   Dean B. Krafft, research associate in computer science at
Cornell, said it will be hard to prove whether Morris was
responsible, because ``it's not a question of having eyewitnesses
... it's not like we have any fingerprints'' left behind from
programs used to create the virus.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief says Iran and Iraq reaffirm cease-fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said
Saturday the latest round of Iran-Iraq peace talks has produced a
``reaffirmation of the commitment'' by both countries to the
2{-month-old cease-fire.
   Perez de Cuellar made his remarks following a face-to-face
meeting between the Iranian and Iraqi foreign ministers. It was the
third such session since the talks resumed Monday.
   Perez de Cuellar then left for Paris and is to return to New York
Sunday.
   The talks were set to continue Monday with another direct meeting
between the two foreign ministers under the mediation of special
U.N. representative Jan Eliasson.
   Perez de Cuellar said this round of negotiations would end by
Nov. 16. The talks are aimed at consolidating the truce that went
into effect Aug. 20 after both sides accepted U.N. Security Council
resolution 598.
   ``During the talks that have taken place over the last several
days, I am pleased that we have had a reaffirmation of the
commitment to the cease-fire,'' Perez de Cuellar said. ``The
political determination to abide by the cease-fire was very clear
during the talks.''
   Iran and Iraq have explained their positions in detail, he said,
but indicated they remained far apart.
   ``I would mislead you if I told you we had fantastic progress,''
the U.N. chief said.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told reporters that
the question of troop withdrawals was one of the problems.
   He repeated Iran's insistence that the withdrawal to
internationally recognized boundaries should be the next step to
follow the cease-fire.
   Iraq has demanded that the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, its only
outlet to the Persian Gulf, be immediately cleared of the silt and
war debris that is blocking it and linked this to a troop withdrawal.
   Iraqi's Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said the talks have been
useful. He said he and Perez de Cuellar had exchanged diplomatic
notes on the privileges and immunities of the UN Iran-Iraq Military
Observer Group that is monitoring the cease-fire.

   Here are excerpts from a speech by
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis at a rally Saturday
in Lansing, Mich.:
   ``I smell victory in the air. ... I don't have to tell you what's
happening out there. You can feel it and sense it and taste it. ...
   ``I think the Republican Party started celebrating a little
early, don't you? I've got a message for them: We're the ones who
are going to be celebrating on the Eighth of November. As a matter
of fact, yesterday George Bush said, `We're going to work hard right
through Nov. 4.' I can understand why he wants the election to be
over. We're going to be working hard until the polls close on the
Eighth of November. I think he's slipping, and we're surging. He
thinks he can inherit the White House, I think you have to earn the
right to be president of the United States. ...
   ``George Bush and the Republican Party have run what has to be
the most cynical and I think distorted campaign in history. It's
been a campaign of distortions and lies and outright garbage and the
more they slip this weekend the more you're going to hear. ...
   ``Americans this weekend all over this country are looking hard
and asking the fundamental question in this campaign: Is it George
Bush or Mike Dukakis who is standing up for working families in this
country. ... If you believe we ought to be exporting American
products and not American jobs _ then we're on your side.
   ``If you believe in equal rights and civil rights and want an
attorney general who respects the law and the Constitution and a
Justice Department that understands the meaning of the word justice
and a Supreme Court that understands the Constitution _ then we're
on your side.
   ``If you believe in college opportunity for every young person _
then we're on your side. And if you believe that it's time for
America to fight a real war and not a phony war on drugs _ then
we're on your side. ...
   ``We're going to invest in our children, not in the Contras. ...
   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I are going to work with you to take back our
streets from crack gangs and drug dealers, to take back our
government from the influence peddlers and sleaze merchants. ...
We're going to have an administration that stands for clean air and
clean water and a clean government in Washington, D.C. ...
   ``I think the American people are fed up with the Republican
campaign. They're fed up with the negativism, the fabrications and
the misrepresentations. You know, when you take that cover off the
Republicans, there's nothing there. ...
   ``Thank you for helping, thank you for coming, see you in
Washington in January.''

   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, gloating that
Republicans are ``dropping like a rock in the polls,'' rallied
volunteers Saturday in delegate-rich California and told radio
listeners the election shouldn't be decided by ``mudslingers and the
truth twisters.''
   ``The Republicans are panicking because the truth is catching up
with them,'' said the Democratic vice presidential nominee, blasting
what he contends are false advertisments by George Bush's campaign.
   The Republican philosophy was, ``If it sounds good, we're going
to say it, and never mind the facts,'' he said.
   Bentsen, speaking at a rally of about 250 Democratic precinct
workers and other supporters in East Los Angeles, said it was now up
to them to get out the word and win California and the election for
him and Michael Dukakis.
   ``My friends, this is the big one _ 47 electoral votes,'' he
said. ``We win it in California, we win it across this nation.''
   Bentsen was joined at the rally by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
and Rep. Esteban Torres, D-Calif., and was introduced by actress
Rita Moreno.
   ``I'll tell you, the Republicans are dropping like a rock in the
polls,'' Bentsen said, repeating his assertion that Michael Dukakis
would _ like Harry Truman _ confound the experts and win.
   A CBS poll released Friday showed Bush leading Democrat Michael
Dukakis by seven points among probable voters, down from the
12-point lead in a survey taken earlier in the week.
   ``I see some of those Republicans popping their champagne
corks,'' he said. ``On Nov. 9, they're going to have one of the
worst hangovers they've ever had.''
   Bentsen wrapped up a one-day swing through California with a
speech later Saturday in San Francisco to a union audience
emphasizing the Democrats' class-conscious theme that they were ``on
your side.''
   The Texas senator, delivering the Democrats' response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address, blasted the Republicans for
negative campaigning and said, ``Even though President Reagan is
trying to lend George Bush a helping hand, I'll bet he's been
disappointed in the behavior of those who now carry the Republican
banner.''
   ``They have spent millions of dollars _ your tax dollars _ to
raise false fears and make you believe this election is about phony
issues,'' he said. ``They hired the best political hit men
Republican money can buy.''
   ``If we permit this election to be decided by the mudslingers and
the truth twisters... we will set a dangerous precedent and put
America on notice that when it comes to choosing a president,
anything goes and the truth really doesn't matter,'' he said.
   Bentsen also was scheduled to appear on two television interview
shows on Sunday, part of the Democrats' aggressive media strategy in
the waning days of the campaign. Late last month, the campaign aired
a five-minute spot on network television featuring Bentsen,
unprecedented for the No. 2 person on the ticket.
   At the East L.A. rally, the bilingual Bentsen mixed a little
Spanish in with his English.
   And he also threw in a Yiddish expression _ chutzpah, which
roughly translates to ``gall'' _ to describe one of Bush's claims
against Dukakis. But he botched the pronunciation of the word.
   Afterward, aides asserted, jokingly, that it was a Texas dialect.
   Later in the day, in a San Francisco union hall near Fisherman's
Wharf, more than 500 Democratic campaign workers staged a boisterous
rally for Bentsen.
   ``We're on the side of working ment and women of America,''
Bentsen declared, citing the Democratic plans for new health care,
education and housing programs.
   Again attacking the Republican ads, he said, ``We're not going to
put up with it, and the American people aren't going to put up with
it,'' he said.
   ``We're armed with the truth, and we're going to set the record
straight,'' he said.
   Tony Podesta, the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign director in
California, said 80 get-out-the-vote rallies were being held in the
state this weekend.

<HEAD>How Computer Viruses Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A computer virus is a tiny program introduced to computers either
as a prank or vandalism.
   Just as a biological virus disrupts living cells to cause
disease, a computer virus invades data processors and disrupts
normal operation of the machines.
   A virus duplicates itself, spreading into other programs in the
computer and infecting one computer after another as users share
floppy disks or link up over telephone lines.
   Mild viruses may do nothing more than flash a provocative message
on a user's screen; ``deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple a
computer. Some are ``time bombs'' designed to wreak havoc on a
pre-programmed date.
   The virus that infected 6,000 university and military computers
nationwide last week apparently did its damage by rapidly
duplicating itself, thereby slowing computers' processing speed and
taking up their memory space.

   Economic Manager Says Reform Showing Results, More Needed
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Politburo member, addressing Communist Party and
government leaders Saturday, said economic reforms are showing
results but must be followed by improvements in food and consumer
goods.
   Nikolai N. Slyunkov spoke at the traditional Kremlin gathering
marking the anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917.
   During the meeting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev talked and
joked with Yegor K. Ligachev, a member of the ruling Politburo and
considered to be a conservative rival of Gorbachev.
   Ligachev, who had been considered the No. 2 man in the Kremlin
hierarchy, was downgraded and given the agriculture portfolio in
Gorbachev's shake-up at the end of September.
   Two Politburo members, Viktor P. Nikonov and Ukrainian party
chief Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, were absent. There was no
explanation for Nikonov's absence, but it was believed Shcherbitsky
was presiding over anniversary ceremonies in Kiev.
   Slyunkov is the former party chief in Byelorussia, which has been
held up as an example of economic reform.
   ``Today, like never before, we need strict discipline, but not
the discipline of the fist but the discipline of interested,
conscious democracy,'' he said.
   The call to social action is ``not fear, but interest, economic
stimulus,'' Slyunkov said.
   He told the gathering of hundreds of party and government leaders
along with scientists and military officers that the national income
is rising because of an increase in labor productivity.
   But the Soviet Union still must supply its citizens with more
consumer goods and food, he said, and part of the solution is the
lease system of farming that Gorbachev is promoting to give farmers
a greater interest in their work.
   Slyunkov expressed the party's support for greater openness in
public discussion, if it does not question the party's power.
   Without offering specifics, Slyunkov said the party also
recognized the need to work out new relations between members of the
country's more than 100 nationalities.
   Ethnic tensions have been especially strong in the southern
republics of Armenian and Azerbaijan and in the Baltic republics of
the northeast.

   A group of ministers will hold a prayer
meeting for American hostage Terry Anderson on Sunday, and a
clergyman who was on an airplane bombed in Athens in 1986 will lead
a prayer for Anderson's captors.
   The ministers plan to speak about the hostages being held in the
Middle East, their families and the people trying to secure their
release, but Tom Kojis said he wanted to talk about the captors.
   ``Sometimes it's a little difficult to know how to pray for your
enemy,'' Kojis said.
   Kojis, pastor at the Wauwatosa Avenue United Methodist Church,
his wife Joan, and son Jon, were aboard TWA flight 840 on April 2,
1986, when a bomb exploded, killing four people.
   But he said he tries to understand the circumstances that led to
the bombing and to other terrorist acts, including Anderson's
abduction.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted March 16, 1985, and is the longest held of any
of the American hostages.
   ``I think that there are times when I look at the whole question
and say are we all guilty?'' Kojis said. ``I try to get away from us
and them.''

<HEAD>Bush Endorses Import Quotas After Lobbying By Steel Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush on Saturday endorsed continued
import quota agreements benefiting the steel industry, an issue that
had dogged him in Pennsylvania where he is in a tight battle with
Michael Dukakis.
   A Dukakis spokesman called Bush's announcement, just three days
before the election, ``cynical and cowardly.''
   A handful of major steel firms had been lobbying the vice
president for a commitment on the quotas, and Sen. John Heinz,
R-Pa., said Bush would lose the state and its 25 electoral votes
unless he promised to extend the trade pacts, which expire next
September.
   Bush released a letter to Heinz Saturday saying that one of his
key trade policy goals as president would be to achieve
``international consensus'' on eliminating unfair steel trade
practices.
   ``Pending that, I can assure you of my intention to continue the
voluntary restraint program after Sept. 30, 1989,'' Bush said in the
letter. ``As vice president, I worked to prevent the sacrifice of
our industry to those who choose not to subject themselves to the
discipline of the market, and I have no intention of abandoning that
commitment if I am elected president.''
   Dukakis spokesman Gene Sperling said the Democrat ``has been in
support of extending the steel agreements for the entire campaign.''
   Dukakis ``challenged Bush to come out in favor of it,'' Sperling
said. ``This is the most cynical and cowardly action one can
imagine. He (Bush) had the entire campaign to come out for the steel
idustry.''
   Pressured by the industry and by Congress, the Reagan
administration negotiated five-year steel trade agreements with
Japan, South Korea and other leading steel-exporting nations in
September 1984. The idea was to give American companies breathing
space from subsidized foreign competition by pressuring competitors
to restrict imports on a product-by-product basis.
   With the steel industry turning a profit last year and with some
importers complaining of steel product shortages, it has been hotly
debated whether the import curbs should be extended.
   Heinz said Bush's letter demonstrated the vice president's
commitment to the nation's manufacturing base and provided ``proof,
I believe, that we will carry Pennsylvania and other industrial
states where the contest is too close to call.''

   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa said
Saturday the government must suspend its decision to close the Lenin
shipyard before he will meet the interior minister to discuss
convening talks on Poland's future.
   ``In this situation, our meeting depends exclusively on the
authorities. In spite of numerous disappointments, I trust that this
time we manage to come to agreement,'' Walesa said in a communique.
   There was no immediate response from the government, but Walesa's
statement appeared to leave the two sides no closer to convening the
government-opposition talks originally planned for mid-October.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said Friday that the
government's decision to close the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk on Dec.
1 was ``irreversible.''
   The Solidarity trade union was formed at the shipyard in 1980 and
became the first free union movement in the Soviet bloc when it was
chartered by the government. But it was suspended in December in
1981 and outlawed in 1982.
   Saturday's developments followed more than three weeks of verbal
sparring between Walesa and the government over when the talks can
begin.
   The talks had stalled over whether Walesa would drop two advisers
from Solidarity's proposed delegation who the government considers
extremists.
   Walesa has said he would not allow officials to interfere in the
composition of Solidarity's delegation. He also said he would not
agree to a preliminary meeting with Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak if the meeting would include personnel matters.
   Kiszczak on Wednesday renewed the offer of a preliminary meeting
in a letter sent to Walesa.
   Walesa said Saturday he would meet with Kiszczak if the
government suspended the shipyard decision and honored a previous
promise to rehire workers dismissed for striking during a wave of
labor unrest in August.
   Walesa delayed a formal reply to Kiszczak until after the
departure Friday of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The government on Monday announced its plan to close the Lenin
shipyard and said the action was taken because of the economic need
to shut down money-losing, state-subsidied industrial plants.
   But Solidarity said the decision by the new prime minister,
longtime Solidarity foe Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, was political.
   Talks among representatives of the opposition, authorities and
other social groups were first proposed by Kiszczak during the
strikes in August.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega on Saturday
urged the new U.S. government to respect the Central American peace
agreement regardless of which party wins Tuesday's election.
   Current U.S. policy ``is not interested in having peace in
Central America and wants a military solution that crushes the
Sandinista revolution and the popular movement in El Salvador,''
Ortega told reporters after meeting Salvadoran leftist leaders.
   He blamed the United States for the breakoff in cease-fire talks
between his Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels, known as
Contras, in September.
   ``What is most serious is that in the days before the election in
the United States we are hearing aggressive and interventionist
rhetoric that threatens the Central American region,'' Ortega said.
   ``The Central American governments must urge the current American
government and the one that emerges from the election to respect the
Esquipulas agreements.
   Five Central American presidents, including Ortega, signed a
peace agreement on Aug. 7, 1987. The plan, known as Esquipulas II
after the Guatemalan town where the presidents had met, calls for
cease-fires, amnesties, and democratic reforms.
   It also calls for an end to outside aid to insurgents and to the
use of a country's territory by rebels from neighboring nations. The
United States accues Nicaragua of helping left-wing rebels fighting
to overthrow the Salvadoran government.

   WASHINGTON _ More women working outside the home have allowed
most American families to keep the buying power they had 10 years
ago, according to a study released Saturday.
   Forty percent of families, however, have not keep pace with the
increasing cost of living over the past decade, said the study by
the Economic Policy Institute.
   The head of the liberal think tank said the report shows average
American families have been under greater economic pressure during
the past decade than at any time since World War II.
   ``Without new economic policies it is clear that families can no
longer count on steadily increasing incomes and that the next
generations cannot expect to live better than their parents,'' said
institute President Jeff Faux, an economist.
   The institute, established in 1986 by prominent liberal
economists, describes itself as a non-partisan, non-profit group. It
has opposed the conservative economic policies of the Reagan
administration.
   The report said salaries for most women have increased faster
than inflation, while salaries for all but the richest American men
haven't kept up.
   The study documents a growing gap between rich and poor in the
United States and says that young adults who do not finish college
are doing ``substantially worse'' than those who were the same age a
decade ago.
   It also says low wages are forcing growing numbers of unattached
young people _ 1.5 million more than a decade ago _ to ``return to
the nest'' of their parents' households rather than living on their
own.
   Economists Stephen Rose of Seattle and David Fasenfest of
Louisville, who wrote the report, said they used statistical methods
that take into account family size. They also used the most
conservative cost-of-living figures to overcome objections to
previous studies that also showed widening inequality and slow
income growth.
   Some conservative economists have argued that Americans are doing
better because families are smaller even if family incomes have not
kept up with inflation.
   ``This is an important first step in measuring the real economic
benefit of having a wife work,'' Rose said in a telephone interview.
He said figures cited by the Reagan administration and others seem
to show improved economic conditions while polls show that people
think they are worse off.
   Income from a working wife, he said, may add to family income but
may cost more in child care, restaurant and other expenses.
   ``More wives are working now because they feel they have to,
because they have to have a certain relative standard of living,''
he said.
   The report says the number of working wives increased from 55.4
percent in 1979 to 66.1 percent in 1986.
   Wives' earnings, adjusted for inflation, increased 12.1 percent
from an average $14,064 in 1979 to $15,768 in 1986, the study says,
while husbands' adjusted earnings dropped from $23,204 in 1979 to
$22,240 in 1986.
   Even with wives working, the study says, roughly two out of five
American families _ those earning less than about 27,000 a year in
1986 _ earned more than they did 10 years ago but the increase did
not keep up with inflation. Adjusted income for all Americans
increased 7.3 percent, however.
   If women had worked only the number of hours they did in 1979,
the study says, average wages would have increased only 4.9 percent,
with three out of five families, or those earning less than $40,000,
lagging behind the inflation rate.
   With more women working, average adjusted family income increased
from the equivalent of $38,492 in 1979 to $41,288 in 1986, the study
says.
   The nation's wealthiest 20 percent earned nine times more than
the poorest in 1986, compared with seven times in 1979, it says. The
top group includes families that earned over $59,533 in 1986. Their
income averaged $94,104, compared with $9,133 for the lowest fifth
of the population.
   Rose said the trend of a widening gap between rich and poor is a
reversal from earlier decades.
   Institute research director Lawrence Mishel said the report was
intentionally released prior to the presidential election, but it
was not intended to be issued so close to election day Tuesday.
   ``We think it's an important part of the debate as to how well
people have been doing. This shows evidence that people are
struggling to get by and that things are not going as well as they
used to,'' he said.

   Sikh separatists attacking across Punjab
state before a major Hindu holiday have killed 62 people, officials
reported Saturday. Security forces were ordered on maximum alert.
   At least 20 Sikh gunmen masquerading as border police killed five
Hindus Saturday night in the village of Darapur, according to C. Pal
Singh, inspector general of police along the border with Pakistan.
   He said the killers separated Hindus from Sikhs and opened fire
on the Hindus in the main crossroads of the village 39 miles
northeast of Amritsar.
   The gunmen, who arrived in two police jeeps and wore uniforms of
India's border security force, escaped after the massacre, Singh
said.
   Police blamed Sikh extremists for five other attacks in Punjab
Friday and Saturday that claimed 57 lives.
   In addition to those deaths, five Sikh militants were killed by
police in Punjab Friday night, Press Trust of India reported.
   Punjab's 32,000-man police force was placed on maximum alert,
according to a police spokesman in the state capital of Chandigarh.
   Hindus, who form a vast majority in India but are outnumbered by
Sikhs in Punjab, will celebrate Diwali, a festival of lights, on
Wednesday.
   Police and news reports gave these accounts of the other deaths:
   Seven bombs exploded Friday in a crowded market in the town of
Batala, 20 miles northeast of Amritsar, killing 28 people and
injuring 50. Most of the victims were Hindus.
   Also Friday, six Sikh militants raided a farm near the town of
Lawdohwal, 70 southeast of Amritsar, and killed 20 Hindu laborers.
   Nine people were killed in three other attacks Friday and
Saturday.
   Militant Sikhs have waged a six-year campaign for a separate
homeland in Punjab.
   The Sikhs say they are discriminated against by the Hindus, who
make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people. Sikhs account for
about 2 percent of the country's population but are a majority in
Punjab.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong, early snow storm blasted the upper Great Lakes region
Saturday, while late-season tornadoes killed one person and caused
scattered damage in parts of Florida and North Carolina.
   Strong thunderstorms spread over the Southeast during the morning.
   A tornado touched down in the community of Lee, Fla., in the
northern part of the state, and one person was killed, authorities
said.
   At least six houses were destroyed, 10 more were damaged and one
business was damaged, said Mary Sampsom, a director of a local Red
Cross chapter.
   The National Weather Service also reported several tornado
sightings from the central Gulf coast to counties inland. Between
midnight and 2 a.m. CDT, three tornados ripped up trees, downed
power lines, tore off shingles and flattened signs and wooden fences
in Bay County. No one was injured, but three houses were damaged.
   Wind blew at more than 70 mph during a severe thunderstorm in
Levy County, Fla., and trees and power lines were reported down in
neighboring Citrus County, where gusts up to 57 mph were recorded.
   Tornadoes also touched down in two northeastern North Carolina
counties, causing property damage but no injuries, authorities said.
   One twister touched down near Elizabeth City State University and
in several residential areas in Elizabeth City, authorities said.
The other twister took the roof off a rural house in Currituck
County.
   The Elizabeth City tornado ``kind of took everyone by surprise''
because twisters rarely occur in November, said police Sgt. H.L.
Bunch.
   Thunderstorm wind gusts were measured to 52 mph at Cape Hatteras,
N.C., and 70 mph at Cedar Key, Fla., the weather service said.
   Winter storm warnings were posted through the night over the
western third of Upper Michigan and northwestern and north-central
Wisconsin, and a snow advisory was issued for eastern Minnesota as a
storm blew through with high wind and heavy snow.
   By midmorning there was 10 inches of new snow at Ironwood, Mich.,
and up to 18 inches was possible in parts of Upper Michigan.
   Four to 6 inches of snow had fallen by midmorning at Phillips,
Wis., and several vehicles slid off roads, said Sgt. Ross Homsa of
the St. Croix County Sheriff Department.
   High wind and blowing snow was expected to cut visibility in some
areas to below a mile, authorities and meterologists said.
   ``We shouldn't have this to just until about the hunting season,
about mid-November'' Homsa said. ``We have snow occasionally before
then, but not like this.''
   In extreme northeastern Minnesota only 1 to 3 inches of snow
fell, but high wind blew it into drifts about a foot deep.
   South of the snow belt, freezing rain was scattered over
northeastern Wisconsin, with showers over the lower Great Lakes,
Lower Michigan, Ohio Valley, central through southern Wisconsin,
Illinois, much of Missouri and southeastern Iowa.
   Heavier rain during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST including 1.29
inches at Cleveland, Ohio, and 1.13 inches at Parkersburg, W.Va.
During the same period, an inch of snow fell in Minnesota at Duluth
and Minneapolis-St. Paul.
   Rain also extended from the Idaho Panhandle across the northern
Pacific Coast.
   High wind warnings were posted over parts of Washington state and
Oregon. Gusts to 58 mph were measured near Bellingham Bay, Wash.,
and gusts up to 70 mph were possible.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 28
degrees at Bemidji, Fergus Falls and Hibbing, Minn., to 90 at Vero
Beach, Fla. Saturday morning's official low was 14 degrees at
Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.
   For Sunday, rain was forecast from New England across the
Virginias, the upper two thirds of the Appalachians, the Ohio
Valley, the lower Great Lakes, Lower Michigan and northeastern
Illinois, changing to snow over Upper Michigan and Wisconsin. Rain
also was forecast from the northern Rockies across the northern and
central Pacific Coast. Strong gusty wind was forecast over the
northern half of the Rockies and the upper Missouri Valley.
   Highs in the 30s and 40s were predicted over the Great Lakes, the
Ohio Valley, the upper half of the Mississippi Valley and much of
the Dakotas; in the 70s over central California; in the 70s and 80s
over Florida, Texas and New Mexico; in the 80s and low 90s through
the desert Southwest; and generally in the 50s and 60s over the
remainder of the nation.

   Bombings, shootings and stabbings have
left 13 people dead and 14 wounded in the past 24 hours in Sri
Lanka's ethnic conflicts, official reports said Saturday.
   An Indian soldier, a Sri Lankan policeman and a Moslem civilian
were killed in two bomb explosions in Trincomalee, 147 miles
northeast of Colombo on Friday, the government's Lankapuwath news
agency reported.
   It said one bomb exploded in a courthouse and the other went off
in a shop patronized by members of the Indian peacekeeping force
deployed in northern and eastern Sri Lanka in an effort to end a
separatist war by Tamil guerrillas.
   A spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, in
Colombo said 10 civilians and four Sri Lankan civilians were wounded
in the bombings.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, she added that Indian troops
killed one Tamil guerrilla and captured 19 others in northern and
eastern Sri Lanka.
   Sri Lankan military officials in Colombo said nine Sinhalese men
were shot or stabbed to death in a series of attacks by Sinhalese
radicals in southern Sri Lanka.
   The slayings were carried out by members of the People's
Liberation Front Friday night and Saturday, according to the
officials who under standing regulations are not identified by name.
   The government has blamed the front for the killings of more than
500 people since July 30 when India and Sri Lanka signed an accord
designed to end the Tamil guerrilla war against the
Sinhalese-dominated government and Sinhalese civilians.
   The front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord, which
was rejected by the Tamil guerrillas.
   The Sinhalese radical group says the accord made too many
concessions to the Tamil minority.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, comprise 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Sinhalese, who are Buddhists, account for
75 percent. There are small Moslem and Christian minorities.
   India became involved in the internal problems of its small
island neighbor through its role as the biggest power in the region
and also because some 60 million Tamils live in southern India.

   Here are excerpts from speeches by Republican presidential
nominee George Bush at a rally in Pennsylvania at Immaculata College
outside Philadelphia, and earlier in New Jersey.
   From Clark, N.J., at GOP headquarters:
   ``New Jersey has always been considered a key battleground ...
and there is a feeling that if we work hard in this state we'll win
it. And we have a very good chance to win it.
   ``Let me tell you ... what I've had to do, because I think
everybody here and everybody across the country knows that when that
national Democratic campaign came on, and that convention, they
thought they were going to kick my brains out and get away with it.
They can dish it out but they can't take it.
   ``We've got three days of campaigning left and the key is get out
that vote. We are building a strong get-out-the-vote effort from the
East Coast to the west. ...
   ``We can't go any further or work any harder. And we're going to
just keep doing it. Let someone else sort out all these polls.
   ``And do I feel I got a good shot at winning? Absolutely. But I'm
not going to turn things around at the last moment and try to
lighten up (on campaigning). We're just going right down to the
wire.''
   From Immaculata College:
   ``I can hardly believe only two and a half days left before we go
to the polls, and am I glad of that. ... We are in a tough state and
I came here to Pennsylvania because this state is critical.''
   Referring to Boston Herald and Boston Globe articles on the
precarious state of the Massachusetts economy:
   ``These papers better be careful. They better because the liberal
governor is going to start accusing them of negative campaigning.''

   The parents of four children wounded when a woman
opened fire in an elementary school have filed a lawsuit against the
woman's parents, contending they should have known she was dangerous.
   The lawsuit filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court is the
third filed against Laurie Dann's parents, Edith and Norman
Wasserman, of Glencoe, in connection with the shootings.
   Ms. Dann entered the Hubbard Woods Elementary School in Winnetka
on May 20, killed 8-year-old Nicholas Corwin and wounded five other
children, headed to a nearby house and shot a college student and
fatally turned the gun on herself.
   The lawsuit contends the Wassermans knew their daughter was
mentally unbalanced and potentially dangerous but ignored expert
advice to have her committed to a mental institution and to remove
guns from their home.
   The negligence lawsuit was filed by the parents of Robert
Trossman, 6, Peter Munro, 8, Lindsay Fisher, 8, and Kathryn Miller,
7.
   A fifth student, Robert Teborek, 8, was also wounded by Ms. Dann,
but is not a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
   Other negligence lawsuits pending against the Wassermans were
filed earlier by the family of Nicholas Corwin and by 20-year-old
Philip Andrew, the wounded college student.

<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Turin court on Saturday convicted 130
people, including two judges, of belonging to a Mafia group that
committed crimes throughout Italy, the news agency ANSA reported.
   It said 26 defendants were given life sentences in the trial of
the ``Clan of Catanesi,'' and clan members were blamed for 61
slayings, four kidnappings and hundreds of robberies. ANSA said the
others convicted received sentences ranging from a few months to 30
years.
   Sixty-eight people were acquitted at the end of the 19-month-long
trial.
   The ``Clan of Catanesi'' was based in the eastern Sicily city of
Catania but expanded its operations nationwide beginning in 1979
with the establishment of bases in the northern cities of Milan and
Turin, according to trial testimony quoted by ANSA. ``Catanesi'' is
the word for residents of Catania.
   Most of the killings attributed to the group were linked to drug
trafficking.
   Among those convicted Saturday were two magistrates: Pietro
Perracchio, the former president of the Catania Court of Assizes who
was sentenced to two years and six months in prison, and Aldo Rocco
Vitale, the former president of the Catania Court of Appeals,
sentenced to two years and eight months.
   Also convicted were the former chief of public order in Catania,
Santo Musumeci, and a former member of the paramilitary Carabinieri,
Luigi Martino, ANSA reported.
   The judges of the Turin Court of Assizes issued the verdicts
after 23 days of deliberation. During the trial, seven relatives of
informants were killed, ANSA reported.
   As the verdicts were read, dozens of police patrolled the area
outside the courthouse and a police helicopter circled overhead.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Hurtle Through Final Weekend</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with new polls, inserting new 4th graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and George Bush hurtled through a final weekend
of campaigning, the underdog Democrat vowing Saturday to work for
those living on ``the family budget, not the family fortune,'' while
his rival pledged he wouldn't be ``outhustled by the liberal
governor from Massachusetts.''
   The two combatants raced across America at a pace that defied
endurance while their managers were pouring millions of dollars into
a campaign-ending television advertising drive.
   The Republicans professed no public concern that their lead might
be dwindling in the race's final days. ``George Bush is not jittery.
Dan Quayle is not jittery,'' said the No. 2 man on the ticket.
   The latest polls agreed Bush still led, but differed on the
trend. CBS reported a margin of 52-43, a slight gain for Bush over
results broadcast 24 hours earlier. Pollster Louis Harris said Bush
led 51-44, with the trend slightly in Dukakis' favor.
   Candidates in the 33 Senate races and 435 House contests on
Tuesday's ballot also went through a final weekend of working, as
did the two dozen rivals contesting the 12 statehouse races.
Democrats were rated as favorites to renew their control in the
Senate and prohibitive favorites to hold a majority in the new House.
   Everyone was straining for the finish line of a campaign marathon.
   ``We are all very tired,'' said Barbara Bush, speaking for
candidates and their entourages everywhere.
   Despite the fatigue, there was no letup with the election three
days away.
   Dukakis used increasingly sharp tones to criticize Republican
vice presidential candidate Quayle and accused Bush of running a
campaign of ``lies and just plain garbage.''
   ``I think the Republican Party began celebrating a little early,
don't you?'' Dukakis said to his crowds as he made his way through
four states. ``They're taking you for granted.''
   Bush also had four states on his itinerary, although aides were
juggling his schedule on the run in a bid to counter Dukakis' moves.
He knocked on doors in one New Jersey neighborhood, made a few
get-out-the-vote telephone calls, painted a campaign sign and told
reporters, ``I don't believe in polls. ... Let someone else sort out
all these polls.''
   Urged by local Republicans to make a gesture to an industry
critical to the Pennsylvania economy, the vice president endorsed
continued import quotas on steel after their scheduled expiration
next Sept. 30, barring an international fair trade agreement.
   Bush and Dukakis campaigned with one eye on the crowds and the
other on the spate of polls being conducted over the weekend to
chart the race in its final days.
   Bush aides spread the word that their own polls showed a modest
improvement in the vice president's support overnight, and claimed a
lead in the range of 8-10 points nationally. Democrats said it was
more like five or six points.
   An Associated Press tabulation showed Bush leading for as many as
359 electoral votes. But many of them were from states where Dukakis
seemed to be gaining, and the vice president could not count on the
270 needed for victory. The survey showed Dukakis leading for as
many as 101 electoral votes, while 78 votes were in states rated as
tossups, including Pennsylvania, Missouri and Illinois.
   The two presidential rivals complimented one another in separate
interviews with television personality David Frost, although the
words had a certain backhanded quality to them.
   ``The contacts I've had with him have been very pleasant,'' Bush
said of his rival. ``But I've been accused of liking, liking, you
know, almost everybody, and I think there is a lot of good in
everyone and certainly in my opponent.''
   Dukakis said, ``I don't normally get personally angry or annoyed
at the people that I run against.'' He added he was surprised and
disappointed at Bush's campaign and added ``there's something I
think out of character about this and there are people who know him
who believe that.''
   So much for the pleasantries, such as they were.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen delivered
the Democratic response to President Reagan's weekly radio address
and campaigned in California. He accused Bush of false campaign
advertising and said the Republican philosophy is, ``If it sounds
good, we're going to say it, never mind the facts.''
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was campaigning
in West Virginia.
   Bush was endorsed by a handful of Democratic municipal and union
officials from New Jersey, and said, ``I will try, if I'm elected,
to be a fair-play president in terms of the working men and women in
this country and in terms of labor itself.''
   In Pennsylvania, he vowed, ``We're not going to be outhustled by
the liberal governor from Massachusetts.''
   The vice president also brushed aside persistent Democratic
complaints about his campaign, saying, ``They can dish it out but
they can't take it.''
   Dukakis depicted Bush as a child of privilege who as president
would help the wealthy. ``He wants to make the rich in this country
even richer,'' the Massachusetts governor said. ``We're on the side
of people who live off the family budget, not the family fortune.''
   The Democrat appeared on stage in Rock Island with a man wearing
a mask that bore the likeness of former President Richard Nixon.
Said Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, ``Yes, it's hard to believe _ Richard
Nixon's running again, only this time he's using the name George
Bush.''
   Reagan campaigned for Bush and the Republicans in his weekly
radio address, and he dusted off an old standby from past campaigns
in personal appearances in Michigan and Texas.
   ``We need you to ride with us,'' he told a crowd at a rodeo
center in Mesquite, Texas. ``And if you would, I hope you'll help
win just one more for the Gipper.''

   Republican nominee George Bush maintained a
comfortable lead for the presidency in two national opinion polls
Saturday, with Michael Dukakis slipping a bit after advancing in one
of them.
   Bush led by nine points, 52-43 percent, in a CBS News-New York
Times poll conducted Wednesday through Friday, recouping slightly
from his seven-point lead in a CBS poll finished the day before.
   He had led by 12 points in a CBS survey early in the week.
   The new CBS-Times survey indicated a potential for further
movement in voter sentiment. It found that a quarter of likely
voters were undecided, only leaning or did not rule out changing
their minds.
   Still, Bush has led by six or more points in every poll since
Oct. 10, and has been ahead in nearly every survey since he accepted
his party's nomination at the Republican National Convention on Aug.
18.
   The other poll conducted Wednesday through Friday, by Louis
Harris and Associates, put Bush ahead by six points, 51 percent to
45 percent. That was virtually unchanged from a seven-point Bush
lead in a Harris poll late last week.
   Harris polls have had the race a bit closer than others.
   Even with his lead, both new polls found some criticism of Bush.
In the CBS-Times poll, 62 percent said the campaign was more
negative than usual _ up from 48 percent a few weeks ago _ and more
blamed Bush.
   In the Harris poll, 71 percent agreed that Bush ``seems to be
running down his opponent too much and not discussing the real
issues.''
   There were 1,252 likely voters in the Harris poll, 1,452 in the
CBS-Times survey. Both had margins of sampling error of plus or
minus three percentage points.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Wants OPEC To Fix Prices For 2-3 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer on
Saturday called on OPEC members to fix oil prices for a period of
two to three years in its search for a way to stabilize the market.
   In a statement distributed by the Saudi Press Agency, Nazer said
again that Saudi Arabia will not abide by its OPEC-decreed
production quota unless the cartel's 12 other members adhered to
theirs.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has not been
able to defend its benchmark price of $18 per barrel because its
member states have been violating their quotas.
   OPEC is set to examine production quotas later this month and
consider increasing the output ceiling to halt violations.
   Nazer said he hoped the ministerial meeting scheduled for Nov. 21
in Vienna would lead to an agreement on ``a maximum price for a
period of two or three years under the meticulous surpervision of
production and prescribed quotas to help remedy the disruption and
stabilize the market in the interest of all.''
   He did not suggest any figures.
   ``We ... look forward with big hope that the forthcoming meeting
of oil ministers of OPEC will produce clear, firm resolutions that
define production quotas and the ceiling,'' Nazer said.
   He added: ``We are surprised at the insistence of some of the
foreign media to pursue the campaign of distortion and incitement
against the kingdom.''
   He apparently referred to recent reports that Saudi Arabia's oil
production had reached 7 million barrels a day when its daily quota
was set for 4.365 million barrels. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's largest
oil exporter and the most powerful force in the cartel.
   Nazer blamed the chaos in the oil market on ``non-adherence by
some member states in OPEC to the resolutions adopted by the
organization in Geneva December 1986'' on production and pricing.
   ``We have repeatedly said and reaffirm today that the kingdom of
Saudi Arabia will be the first state to respect adherence to its
defined quota on condition that all member states in OPEC abide by
their quotas in a categoric and decisive manner,'' he said.
   ``We categorically reject that the kingdom alone abide by its
quota while others exceed theirs.''

   A story in a national magazine on this
Appalachian Mountains town and its unbending support of the high
school football team has residents driving nearly halfway across
Kentucky for copies.
   People magazine sold out in Pikeville stores soon after it
appeared on shelves last week, frustrating residents eager to see
the six-page spread.
   ``It's the biggest demand I've ever had,'' said Travis Goff,
owner of a downtown newsstand.
   Storeowners such as Goff are taking special orders for shipments
of extra magazines, and a radio station is giving copies away in a
special promotion.
   Many in the eastern Kentucky town of about 5,000 said there was a
good reason for the story in People's Nov. 7 issue. The Pikeville
High School Panthers football squad went undefeated for the second
straight season.
   ``I think it's a good gesture toward the team and the town,''
said Coach Hillard Howard. ``It's something this team deserves. You
don't see many teams like this one come down the pike.''
   The story focuses on Pikeville's 22-0 triumph Oct. 13 over
Paintsville, which had gone into the game undefeated.
   Sandy Necessary, distribution manager for a regional magazine
wholesaler in Paintsville, said she believes People was sold out
last week throughout most of eastern Kentucky.
   The wholesaler hoped to get more copies, but some people just
weren't willing to wait.
   Ms. Necessary said distributors in central Kentucky reported
Pikeville residents have driven 145 miles to some stores in
Lexington and bought up to 200 copies.

   Between 500 and 1,000 chanting anti-Ku Klux
Klan demonstraters celebrated victory Saturday before Independence
Hall, a week after white supremacists called off a rally for the
same day.
   A skirmish between so-called ``skinheads'' and the demonstrators
broke out in front of the federal building near the Liberty Bell,
but no arrests were made, police Capt. Ricard Delise said.
   The anti-Klan rally was organized by the Partisan Defense
Committee to protest the proposed rally by the Klan and other white
supremacist groups. The committee held their rally despite the
Klan's decision to cancel.
   ``We believe blacks and working people have won a victory and
forced the KKK and skinheads to back down,'' said Jon Brooks,
spokesman for the committee. ``The idea of the mobilization was to
make it as broad as possible. Anybody who wanted to stop the Klan
was welcome.''
   Brooks said he did not know how many people the New York-based
committee brought to Philadelphia, but said several buses were used.
   Speakers led the occasionally rain-soaked crowd in chants of
``Hey, hey, ho ho, the Ku Klux Klan has got to go,'' and some people
milled around carrying signs protesting the Klan and some calling
for a worker's revolution.
   At least five skinheads showed up for the ``white pride day,''
unaware that the Klan-organized rally was called off Oct. 26 as
opposition grew.
   The skinheads, so-called for their close-cropped hair, wore
red-laced, black combat boots and blue jeans, with swastikas and
American flags pinned to black jackets. They were allowed to stand
just north of the anti-Klan rally.
   ``We originally came up for the Klan rally today. Since we're
from Baltimore we didn't know it was canceled,'' said skinhead
Dennis Baranowski. ``We didn't come here to get violent.''
   He said the Skinheads advocate partitioning the country, setting
aside the five Northwestern states for whites and the rest for
blacks.
   Estimates of the crowd size varied, with police counting nearly
500 protesters and the National Park Service saying there were
nearly 1,000 on hand.
   Scores of police patrolled the perimeter of the rally on foot and
horseback. Delise would not say how many police were there, but park
superintendent Hobart Cawood said he had brought in 120 park rangers
and police from Washington to help the 20 park service officers
stationed in Philadelphia.
   Tours went on as usual at Independence Hall, where the
Constitution was signed, and the Liberty Bell.
   ``It (free speech) is one of the marks of our country. It's
tragic we have to have so many police police and security,'' said
the Rev. Max Smith, a tourist from Ligonier.

<HEAD>Amal and Hezbollah Agree To Non-Kidnapping Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Syrian-backed Amal militia and
pro-Iranian Hezbollah said Saturday they have agreed to a
non-kidnapping pact to avoid a military confrontation between the
two main Shiite Moslem factions in Lebanon.
   The pact, announced in statements issued by both groups, would
apply to abductions by one group of partisans of the other. It would
not involve the 14 foreign hostages believed held in Lebanon.
   Amal, Arabic for hope, and Hezbollah, or Party of God, have been
locked for years in a bloody struggle for dominance of Lebanon's one
million Shiites.
   The statements issued by the two groups said the agreement was
sponsored by the command of the Syrian army contingent in charge of
security in Beirut's westerm Moslem sector.
   But sources on both sides, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they doubted the agreement would last despite pressures from
Syria and Iran to unify Moslem ranks in Lebanon.
   The Syrians sent troops into south Beirut's Shiite slums May 27
to halt battles between the two rivals that left about 300 people
killed and 1,000 wounded.
   A truce was arranged but it has been strained by more kidnappings
and the Syrian command pressed both factions to sign the new accord.
   The statements said the last 17 kidnap victims were exchanged
under the auspices of Syrian army officers after the agreement was
signed Friday night.
   The latest effort to end the Hezbollah-Amal feud came after a
visit to Syria by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who
made several calls for unity among Lebanon's Moslem factions and met
with Hezbollah representatives.
   These moves appeared to be an effort by both Syria and Iran to
counter Iraq's recent intervention into Lebanese politics. Arab
diplomatic sources say the Iraqis have sent weapons and ammunition
to the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main military militia, since
a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted the Iran-Iraq war Aug.20. Iran
and Iraq went to war in September 1980.
   Of the 14 foreign hostages believed held in Lebanon, nine are
Americans. Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   Elections officials on Saturday appealed a
judge's order barring the state from using a law that limits people
to 10 minutes in the voting booth.
   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Aguilar in San Jose issued a
temporary restraining order Friday, preventing at least three
counties from enforcing some measure of the 97-year-old law.
   ``There has never been stop-watch voting in California ... and
there's never been a problem with that provision of the law all
these years,'' said Tony Miller, chief deputy secretary of state.
His office filed the appeal on behalf of county elections officials.
   ``There's never been a time where elections officials have pulled
voters out of the booth, and that's not how it was going to be used
this time,'' he said.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco was
scheduled to hear arguments Sunday from lawyers representing state
and county elections agencies and from civil rights lawyers who
claim the limit disenfranchises those with language difficulties or
for whom English is a second language.
   A ruling was not expected until Monday.
   In barring use of the law, Aguilar called it a virtual literacy
proficiency test, which is specifically outlawed by the federal
Voting Rights Act.
   The temporary restraining order was sought after Marin, Sonoma
and Santa Clara counties announced they would rely on the measure to
speed people through the voting process. Election officials were
concerned about a complicated ballot tying up the booths.
   The decision to enforce the time limit was especially
controversial in Santa Clara County, where bilingual ballots are not
available in the voting booth.
   On Tuesday, California voters will be asked to vote for a
presidential ticket, a U.S. senator, state candidates, 29 state
propositions and a plethora of local races and issues.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is investigating campaign
literature U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall mailed to constituents that
referred to results of a polygraph test he took in connection with
his trial on perjury charges.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Vining had previously ruled the
results inadmissible and was forced to dismiss the jury that was to
hear the charges, ending Swindall's bid for a swift, pre-election
trial.
   On Tuesday, Swindall, a two-term Republican, faces Democrat Ben
Jones in a bitterly contested election.
   Both mailings, sent shortly before jury selection was to begin,
mentioned Swindall's claim that he was exonerated by a polygraph
test. Vining ruled the literature might influence jurors.
   Swindall is accused of lying to a grand jury when he said he did
not remember being told that an $850,000 home mortgage loan he was
seeking might be coming from illegal drug proceeds.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said Saturday the Justice Department's
Office of Public Integrity in Washington, D.C., will handle the
investigation.
   ``Neither of these, the Office of Public Integrity nor my office,
is in the habit of wasting our time on frivolous pursuits,'' said
Barr. ``We have asked them to look into it because we believe there
is something that requires and demands an investigation. And they
obviously feel the same way, since they have started the
investigation.''
   Swindall said the investigation was politically motivated.
   ``I am not going to talk about anything going on in the Justice
Department because I intend, when I am re-elected, to investigate
the entire handling of this matter,'' Swindall said.
   Swindall said the House Judiciary Committee, of which he is a
member, will investigate the matter. He declined to say whether any
of his campaign staff had been subpoenaed in the latest
investigation.

   A church van crashed Saturday while carrying
relatives to visit inmates at Nottoway Correctional Center, killing
three people and injuring 17 others, police said.
   No other vehicles were involved in the accident on U.S. 360, said
Officer M.E. Reed of the Chesterfield County Police. There were
about 21 people on the van.
   The Second Presbyterian Church in Richmond operates two vans each
Saturday that take people to visit relatives at the prison, a prison
employee said.
   One person died at the scene and two others died shortly after
arriving at Johnston-Willis Hospital around 1 p.m., spokeswoman
Carol Mawyer said. She said a 4 or 5-year-old child died in the
emergency room and a middle-aged woman died shortly afterward in the
operating room.
   Two people were in serious condition at Johnston-Willis with
pelvis, back and neck injuries, Ms. Mawyer said. Two others were in
stable condition.
   A supervisor at Chippenham Hospital said nine patients were
treated and released and one was admitted.
   And Doug Borg, superintendent of Medical College of Virginia
Hospitals, said three people were being treated, but did not release
their names.

   A 12-year-old boy suffered fatal burns Saturday
when a bonfire and fireworks exploded during the annual celebration
of Guy Fawkes Night, police reported.
   They said an 11-year-old boy received burns to his face and legs
in the blast at an empty lot in the Scottish mining village of
Cowie, 25 miles northwest of Edinburgh.
   Emergency services were busy across Britain as fireworks caused
scores of accidents.
   Bonfires and fireworks on Nov. 5 celebrate the foiling of a
conspiracy to kill King James I at the state opening of Parliament
in 1605 by exploding barrels of gunpowder in the vaults. Guy Fawkes
and seven other plotters were executed.
   Police reported one person was detained after nine people were
taken to a hospital with cuts and burns after fireworks shot burning
material into a crowd at Walton-le-Dale near Preston, Lancashire.
   Four children and an adult were hurt at a fireworks diplay in
Orpington, Kent, when a stray device from a neighboring display
landed in a box of fireworks and set them off.
   London Fire Brigade said its firefighters were dealing with
bonfires getting out of control and setting garden sheds and fences
ablaze.

   ``L.A. Law'' character Arnie Becker might consider
himself above joining any club that would have him as a member, but
real-life counterparts of the television divorce lawyer decided
Saturday they weren't ready to ask him anyway.
   Against an ever-shifting legal and social backdrop, the American
Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers scheduled a four-day meeting to
discuss such weighty matters as custody and surrogacy and the
economic hardships of no-fault divorce for some women.
   But tucked between the serious seminars, the academy found time
for a panel discussion entitled _ ``Arnie Becker _ How Real is He?''
   The elite group also mulled over whether he would make a good
member.
   ``I'm not comfortable thinking about Arnie or any other character
strictly as a role model, because dramatically, that's too limiting
a standard to hold him to,'' said Bill Finkelstein, an ``L.A. Law''
story editor and producer who writes Arnie Becker's character,
portrayed by actor Corbin Bernsen, for the popular television show.
   Finkelstein, a lawyer who has put aside his practice while
working on ``L.A. Law,'' sat in on Saturday's panel.
   ``Like everybody else, Arnie has different sides, some heroic and
some anything but heroic. ... Arnie has done things that if someone
I knew in real life had, I'd say, `What a jerk!'
   ``By the same token,'' Finkelstein continued, ``he's done some
things I greatly admire. And in this company, in dress, behavior and
other measures, I'd say he's basically middle of the pack. There are
a fair share of matrimonial lawyers more flamboyant than Arnie.''
   Leonard Loeb, president of the academy, credits Arnie Becker's
character with raising public awareness of the legal specialty, but
says it's impossible to know whether the character has actually
influenced members of the profession.
   ``The character is bigger than life, but not unreal,'' said Loeb.
   ``And we're up closer than most people. We see the warts and
freckles, we understand many of the things he goes through. I
suppose the jury is still out, to what extent the portrayal has
helped.''
   The jury returned Saturday, however, with a verdict against Arnie
Becker. By a vote of 50-14, academy members said he should not be
considered at this time, said Loeb.
   The vote, fortunately, was nothing more than a honorarium and
probably won't affect Becker's television following. Besides,
fictional characters cannot join the elite academy, which is made up
of about 1,000 of the nation's 40,000 divorce lawyers. The American
Bar Association's Family Law Section, by contrast, has about 16,000
members.
   One thing Arnie Becker has going for him is the perception that
``L.A. Law'' has not only glamorized the business, it has encouraged
more young people to enroll in law school.
   ``Enrollment is definitely up,'' said Finkelstein, ``but I don't
know whether that means I get the credit or the blame.''

<TEXT>
   Some 500 health care professionals have
vowed that if a California ballot measure forcing them to report
positive AIDS-test results becomes law, they will defy it, a
spokesman for the group said Saturday.
   Employees at the largest anonymous testing center in San
Francisco also said they would refuse to reveal names of those who
test positive for the human immunodeficiency virus if Proposition
102 is approved on Tuesday.
   Proposition 102 would ban anonymous testing for the AIDS virus,
require health officials and others to report the names of people
``reasonably believed'' to be infected with HIV, and require those
infected with the virus to report the names of their spouse or
sexual partners. Insurance companies could also test for the virus.
   ``The bottom line is when police come to our door and ask for the
names, we'll have to say we will not be accomplices to something
designed for discrimination,'' said Rabbi Yoel Kahn of Congregation
Sha'ar Zahav, which operates an outreach to the gay and lesbian
community in San Francisco.
   ``The irresponsibile use of this information can result in people
losing jobs, their health insurance and their homes,'' added Kahn,
who fears that as a clergyman he may be required to report those
carrying the virus.
   Under the initiative, doctors face misdemeanor charges and fines
of $250 for each patient they fail to report.
   Despite that, Dr. Floyd Huen, medical director of Highland
Hospital in Oakland, said 50 physicians had signed a pledge not to
report the names of patients infected with HIV.
   ``I signed it. I will not turn over anyone in my practice,'' Huen
said. ``This is bad public health policy because it will keep people
away from being tested and treatment because of fear that they will
be reported.''
   Huen said many staff members are considering shredding patient
records if the initiative passes.
   Francis Salmeri, a spokesman for the Alternative Test Site, said
workers have decided if the measure passes they will continue
offering free anonymous HIV tests.
   ``Under no condition will we give out names,'' Salmeri said.
   Supporters of the measure reacted angrily to the pledge program.
   ``I do not think responsible people should ask people to break
the law,'' said Paul Mero, an aide to Rep. William Dannemeyer of
Fullerton.
   Dannemeyer co-sponsored the initiative with Paul Gann, the tax
crusader who helped spearhead property tax-slashing Proposition 13 a
decade ago, and who is now suffering from acquired immune deficiency
syndrome because of a tainted blood transfusion.
   Gov. George Deukmejian provoked an outcry from medical experts
last week when he announced he would vote for the proposition. Three
members of an advisory state AIDS committee resigned their positions
in protest.
   The governor's endorsement prompted U.S. Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop to denounce the measure, saying it would set back AIDS
research a minimum of five years.

   President Reagan told supporters in the
Lone Star state on Saturday that even though he's ``riding off into
the sunset,'' the Reagan era can continue if voters cast their
ballots for George Bush.
   Reagan pulled out all the sentimental stops as he battled for
Bush on a one-day trip to the battleground states of Michigan and
Texas on the final weekend of the presidential campaign. Michigan,
with 20 electoral votes, and Texas, with 29, are crucial for the
Democrats.
   The president appealed directly to conservative Democrats in both
states, who could put his vice president over the top in the
ever-tightening race against Michael Dukakis. He said this campaign
is special for him.
   ``The election is in just three days and I'm on my final campaign
swing,'' Reagan said. At a suburban Dallas rodeo grounds, he said,
``Although, come January, I'm going to be riding off into the
sunset, I feel a little like I'm on the ballot myself this year.''
   At the indoor arena, Reagan arrived in a horse-drawn carriage.
The president, clad in a brown suit and waving a gray cowboy hat,
smiled and waved as the crowd hollered.
   Although not naming him, Reagan held Democrat Dukakis up to
ridicule as the candidate who will ``take America backwards,'' and
hailed Bush as the man of the future.
   ``America stands on the brink of an era of national greatness
that will exceed anything that any country on Earth has ever known
before,'' Reagan boasted.
   Only if Bush is elected, Reagan predicted, will the nation's
economy continue on the upswing, will Communism remain ``in
retreat,'' and will ``American culture and technology dominate the
world.''
   ``From television's Dallas to Disneyland, to the space shuttle
Discovery, an entire planet is watching and following us, and yes,
America truly is the envy of the world,'' Reagan said.
   At the Rodeo Center in Mesquite, he cautioned aginst complacency
and overconfidence. ``We need you to vote, we need you to ride with
us. And if you would, I hope you'll help win just one more for the
Gipper. And really, let's all do this together for America.''
   The president is set to make a trip to California on Monday in an
attempt to stall any election-eve slide of his home state's 47
electoral votes toward Dukakis.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said during the trip back
to Washington late Saturday that Reagan felt ``very good'' about his
day of campaigning and looks forward to the visit to California,
where the White House finds the race to be a close one.
   Fitzwater said White House tracking information showed ``our
opposition's effort in recent days appears to have leveled off and a
surge has returned to Bush.''
   And as he has for the past week of cross-country campaign jaunts
on Bush's behalf, Reagan said the choice between Bush and Dukakis is
a clear one.
   At a rally in Macomb County Community College near Detroit,
Reagan accused Bush's rival of opposing voluntary prayer in school,
supporting gun control and a ``weak-kneed defense policy'' and
appointing ``left-wing judges'' such as those ``in a state like
Massachusetts.''
   ``That's why I'm here today: to bring home the simple fact that
all the progress we have made is on the line. Today's activities are
part of a get-out-the-vote campaign and I just want to tell each one
of you to go to the polls on Tuesday and get your friends to go, too
_ to cast their and your votes for George Bush,'' Reagan said.
   ``I want to ask those of you some people call Reagan Democrats to
join me and come home with me today. Come home to me and to George
Bush,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan, in his weekly taped radio address, hailed the ``vibrant
and fractious and exciting'' campaign year.
   ``There is no sight more moving than a lone American walking to
that voting booth, casting a ballot in secret, and thereby
determining the destiny of this great country,'' he said. He added
another plug for Bush.
   ``Yes, my fellow Americans, there is a choice, a very important
choice _ a vote for George Bush is a vote for optimism. ... It's an
endorsement of what we've done these past eight years, and of our
heartfelt promise that tomorrow and the days to come will be
brighter still,'' Reagan said.

<TEXT>
   President Miguel de la Madrid on
Saturday inaugurated this federally-sponsored Pacific coast resort,
30 years before the project's scheduled completion.
   De la Madrid toured a new medical center, other public facilities
built by the government for Huatulco's burgeoning population and the
500-room Club Med and 320-room Sheraton.
   Huatulco, about 340 miles southeast of Mexico City and 270 miles
southeast of the Pacific resort of Acapulco, was begun four years
ago. It is now largely roads and water and power lines cut into the
semitropical jungle.
   During the inaugural ceremony, Tourism Secretary Antonio Enriquez
Savignac assailed illegal land takeovers in the area as harmful to
the nation's tourism trade and potential foreign investment.
   Enriquez Savignac also criticized local landholders who refused
to move to La Crucecita, a town the government built a little more
than a mile inland for Huatulco's current and future populations.
   Huatalco includes nine bays along a 20-mile stretch of coastline.
Each of the nine bays will have a different theme, said Jose Ignacio
Cacho, vice president for marketing for the government tourism
agency Fonatur.
   Huatulco, the last of major government-sponsored resorts to be
developed under a 1968 master plan, is scheduled to be completed in
the year 2018.
   Cacho said Huatulco is geared to the North American market, with
some 80 percent of foreign visitors expected to come from the United
States and another 10 percent from Canada. The government projects
Huatulco will host about 100,000 tourists in 1989 and more than 2
million a year when completed.
   Between 5.6 million and 5.7 million tourists will come to Mexico
this year, according to government projections.

   A U.S. Marine Corps jet crashed at
Maxwell Air Force Base Saturday, but the pilot escaped serious
injury by ejecting, an official said.
   The pilot was the only person aboard the AV-8 Harrier, also known
as a ``jump jet'' because of its ability to takeoff and land
vertically, said base spokeswoman Darlene Cowsert,
   The pilot, Capt. Bradley Devries, based at Cherry Point, N.C.,
was treated at Air University Regional Hospital, where he was taken
following the 12:50 p.m. crash. He was released later Saturday.
   ``As he was attempting to land he experienced some difficulties,
so he ejected,'' she said. The jet came to a rest off the runway.

   George Bush tried to rally final-weekend
support Saturday in a rapid series of campaign stops, knocking on
doors, working telephones, painting signs and declaring ``let
someone else sort out all these polls.''
   In a day of cross-country campaigning, Bush dismissed new public
opinion polls suggesting he was still ahead of Democrat Michael
Duakakis but by a narrowing margin.
   Bush's route on Saturday in part shadowed campaign stops by
Dukakis as Republican strategists sought to blunt the Democrat's
concluding campaign blitz.
   ``I don't believe in polls,'' the vice president told reporters
in Clark, N.J., during a morning visit to his Union County campaign
headquarters, where he briefly worked a phone bank and got down on
hands and knees to help children paint campaign signs.
   At a rally at Immaculata College in the Philadelphia suburb of
Malvern, Bush called Pennsylvania, with its 25 electoral votes,
critical. ``It can go either way. I am going to work not just here
but all across the country, from this coast to the West Coast. We
are not going to be outhustled by the liberal governor from
Massachusetts.''
   Earlier, Bush told reporters in New Jersey, ``Let someone else
sort out all these polls.''
   But he also added, ``Do I feel I've got a good shot at winning?
Absolutely. But I'm not going to turn things around at the last
moment and try to lighten up.''
   ``We can't go any further or work any harder,'' Bush said.
   The vice president and his entourage also walked door-to-door
along a leafy street of an affluent neighborhood in Westfield, N.J.,
near Newark, calling on people in three houses and urging them to
vote for him.
   ``The invasion squad, hitting your beautiful home,'' Bush joked
at the first home he visited.
   ``We were overwhelmed, to say the least,'' said Sherry Rogers
after Bush visited her and her husband Tom Rogers. She said the
majority of the neighborhood was ``very pro-Bush.''
   He also planned a get-out-the vote street walk in Peoria, Ill.,
before heading to Colorado. On Sunday, Bush was to campaign in
California, and then head back east again for more campaigning in
the Midwest before ending on Monday in Texas.
   As Saturday's campaign activities drew to a close, Bush told
reporters aboard his plane: ``We're in the highest degree of
tension. ... Sometimes I get extraordinarily tired, but it's
understandable.''
   ``Sometimes I sleep, sometimes I don't,'' he continued. ``It's
the total tension.''
   Bush campaign officials kept making last minute schedule changes
based on overnight polls _ and taking into account Dukakis'
movements.
   At the New Jersey campaign office, Bush was endorsed by a handful
of Democratic municipal and union officials from nearby comunities.
   ``I will try, if I'm elected, to be a fair-play president in
terms of the working men and women in this country and in terms of
labor itself,'' he told campaign workers afterward.
   Meanwhile, the Bush camp shrugged off a CBS poll released Friday
indicating his double-digit lead of a week ago was shrinking _ to
seven points from 12. A survey released Saturday by the network
showed Bush increasing the lead to nine points, 52-43.
   His wife, Barbara, said, ``I don't believe the polls. We take our
own polls and ours look all right.'' Mrs. Bush, who rode one leg of
Saturday's campaign swing on the plane chartered by news
organizations, added, ``We are all very tired.''
   Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate said the campaign was constantly
shifting its schedule to shore up support in key battleground states
and to attempt to outmaneuver Dukakis.
   Bush and Mrs. Bush also walked down the main street of
Chillicothe, Ill., in a cold drizzle, giving thumbs-up signs and
shaking hands with many of the several thousand townspeople who
lined both sides of the street.
   He vowed in a speech in front of the town fire station, as he has
done for days, to ``run as if I was ten points back.''
   Bush praised the town as ``middle America with the strongest
values that exist.''
   Meanwhile, a senior Bush campaign official, who spoke only on the
condition of anonymity, said that shadowing Dukakis was ``one
aspect'' of Bush's strategy in his final drive.
   ``It's a complicated strategy,'' the official said. ``You bracket
him (Dukakis). You checkmate him. You fuzz up his message by using
his own language against him.''
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief-of-staff, said Colorado _ the next
stop _ was a state where Bush had been firmly ahead but in which the
race ``has tightened.''
   He said Bush's remaining travel was being guided entirely from
Washington by campaign Chairman James A. Baker III, campaign manager
Lee Atwater and pollster Robert Teeter.
   ```My colleagues in Washington are cool and cautious. They are
concerned when there is any signs of shrinkage,'' Fuller said.
   Campaign officials, meanwhile, said two new ads would be aired
nationally through Monday.
   Alixe Glen, a campaign official, said both were positive ads, one
a photo composite with singer-composer Lee Greenwood singing ``God
Bless the U.S.A'' in the background, the other showing Bush sitting
talking.

   Employers fearing penalties under the new federal
immigration law are discriminating against legal aliens and U.S.
citizens who appear to be foreigners, according to a study.
   The study conducted by the New York Task Force on Immigration
Affairs confirmed fears expressed by experts who said the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 would result in
discriminatory behavior against certain workers.
   The report, which was to be released Monday, found that many
employers were still unfamiliar with provisions of the new law and
that some simply refuse to consider job applicants who look or sound
foreign.
   ``It is clear from our data that the scope of these
(discriminatory) practices is broad,'' the task force panel said.
   The panel estimated that more than 22,000 U.S. citizens or aliens
authorized to work ``were either temporarily denied work or not
hired by an employer'' in the state.
   The act offered amnesty to eligible aliens until May 4 of this
year and, starting in June, called for stiff fines and other
sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens.
   The task force based its study on 400 randomly placed telephone
calls last month to employers in New York.
   The federal General Accounting Office, which is required by
Congress to investigate evidence of employer discrimination
concerning the law, is expected to release its own report on Monday.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, campaigning in southern
Texas on Saturday, accused his Republican opponents of ``big brother
tactics'' aimed at intimidating Hispanics and discouraging them from
voting.
   He called on Republican George Bush to apologize and to halt
radio commercials airing along the Mexican border that Democrats
allege may discourage qualified minority voters from going to the
polls.
   ``If you believe as we believe that the right to vote freely and
without intimidation is the most sacred right we have as Americans,
I'm sure you share my anger at these Republican radio commercials,''
Dukakis said.
   ``The only purpose for those ads is to scare voters into not
voting,'' Dukakis said. ``... These big brother tactics have no
place in America, have no place in Texas. This is not a
dictatorship; this is a democracy.''
   Dukakis, waging an intensive final weekend of campaigning before
Tuesday's presidential election, spoke to several thousand people at
an evening rally outside the Hidalgo County Courthouse.
   Making a final push to carry Texas, where he trails in the polls,
Dukakis flew to this town in southernmost Texas' Rio Grande Valley.
It was near McAllen, the home of running mate Lloyd Bentsen and
where Dukakis made his first stop following his nomination at the
Democratic convention in July.
   Advertisement being aired in the heavily Hispanic area remind
listeners it is illegal for non-citizens to vote and say ``election
officials will be on guard.'' The ads mention possible jail terms
and fines.
   The U.S. Justice Department said Thursday it would look into
possible intimidation.
   ``I think it's time that Mr. Bush repudiated those ads and
stopped them and apologized to you,'' Dukakis said.
   Earlier Saturday, Dukakis spoke to a large crowd in Rock Island,
Ill., and said of the Republicans, ``They were taking you for
granted.''
   Later, in Lansing, Mich., Dukakis accused Bush of campaigning on
``lies and just plain garbage,'' and said, ``I think the American
people are fed up with the Republican campaign _ they're fed up with
the negativism and the falsehoods and the misrepresentations.''
   Dukakis' fast-paced schedule took him from Illinois to Michigan
to Texas to Colorado on the last Saturday of his presidential
campaign. At each stop, he declared that large and enthusiastic
crowds were a sign that, despite his deficit in public opinion
polls, he was overtaking Bush.
   ``Do I smell victory in the air?'' he said. ``You can feel it and
sense it and taste it.''
   Dukakis spoke to a crowd gathered inside an airport baggage room
in Lansing before flying to the Detroit suburb of Taylor. Hundreds
more stood outside in the rain, and Dukakis sprinted through the
rain to shake hands and greet those who waited in the downpour.
   The Democrat heaped fresh scorn on GOP vice presidential
candidate Dan Quayle. Bush had said in a television interview with
David Frost that if elected he might put Quayle in charge of the
White House crisis management group.
   ``Dan Quayle?'' Dukakis said. ``In charge of managing the most
serious crises we face in the country? That's a frightening thing,
isn't it?''
   In Rock Island, the Massachusetts governor depicted Bush as a
child of privilege who as president would benefit only the most
wealthy.
   ``He wants to make the rich in this country even richer,''
Dukakis said.
   ``We're on the side of people who live off the family budget, not
the family fortune,'' he said.
   Dukakis appeared on the stage at a Rock Island exhibition hall
with a man wearing a mask that looked like former President Richard
Nixon. Sen. Tom Harkin of nearby Iowa compared Bush to that former
president, who resigned in disgrace.
   ``Just as there was no new Richard Nixon in 1968, there is no new
George Bush in 1988,'' Harkin said.
   Dukakis repeated his claim that his campaign is coming back.
``He's coasting and we're fighting back,'' he said. ``He's slipping
and we're surging.
   Dukakis, buoyed by a CBS News poll showing a narrowing margin
with Bush, was campaigning at a frenetic pace in the final days to
the election.
   He flew to Rock Island from Chicago, and from there flew to
Michigan for rallies in Lansing and Detroit.
   He was flying on to Denver late in the evening and was heading to
the West Coast on Sunday.
   Dukakis was spending nearly every available moment in search of
votes. He planned a day of campaigning in California on Monday and a
middle-of-the-night rally in Iowa on his red-eye flight home to
Boston to vote and await the returns. Aides were considering a final
stop in Ohio, too, on the way home.
   The CBS poll released Friday night showed Dukakis trailing Bush
by 7 percentage points, down from 12 points just three days earlier.
Campaign aides contended their own polling had the race close in
battleground states, although Democratic Party officials said he
remained well behind in Ohio.

   More than 100 abortion protesters,

during a demonstration at a clinic, police said.
   About 200 people picketed outside the Sigma Women's Center,
blocking the clinic's entrance, said police spokesman Ott Cefkin.
   Among those arrested were three juveniles, ages 13, 15 and 16,
who were charged with trespassing and released to their parents.
   Bonnie Callahan, a spokeswoman for the protestors, said 112
demonstrators were arrested in all, including five pastors.
   Most were given notices to appear in court. Others were booked
and released under small bonds.
   No injuries were reported during the demonstration, which was
organized by the Rescue South Florida group.
   In Rhode Island, about 60 people picketed outside Providence's
Women and Infants Hospital on Saturday for about five hours. Police
said there were no arrests.

   Emma Thomas, who was believed by family

her family said.
   Family members had been unable to document that Mrs. Thomas'

oldest known person. She died Friday.
   The latest edition of the Guiness Book of World Records lists a
112-year-old Miami woman as the oldest, but a spokesman said the
editors now have documentation of a 113-year-old French woman.
   Born Emma Broadwater in Anne Arundel County, she was married
twice and had 12 children.
   At her last birthday party, Mrs. Thomas declared, ``I feel

   She is survived by two daughters; three sons; 17 grandchildren;
30 great-grandchildren; 26 great-great grandchildren; and three

   Funeral services were scheduled Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, marking
the 1st anniversary of his seizing power, announced on Saturday the
immediate release of about 2,200 political prisoners and common
criminals.
   Ben Ali ousted President Habib Bourguiba last Nov. 7.
   His announcement on the release of the inmates said the action
was part of his effort ``to empty the prisons of political
detainees, strengthen national reconciliation and install
understanding and concord among all Tunisians to allow them to take
part in the building of a new Tunisia.''
   Among those released, according to the statement, were 41 Islamic
fundamentalists imprisoned for political crimes shortly before
Bourguiba's ouster and 47 others convicted and jailed after Ben Ali
became president.
   In addition to the releases Ben Ali also ordered prosecutions to
be dropped against 70 people accused of security violations who
``did not carry out or plan acts of violence,'' the announcement
reported.
   It said the decree ordered the release of 2,096 common criminals
and 694 people sentenced to lose their political rights were
``rehabilitated.''
   Ben Ali has approved the release of more than 6,100 prisoners in
the past year and restored the political rights of 4,081 Tunisians.

   Rescue workers have failed to locate four men

during takeoff from an oil platform, officials said Saturday.
   The men were presumed dead.
   Six men were aboard the helicopter when it crashed Friday during
takeoff from a Mobil Oil Co. platform about 120 miles off the coast.
   A crewboat rescued two the men shortly after the accident, said
Mike O'Malley of Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast in
Dallas.
   O'Malley said rescue efforts to find the other four were hampered
by 9-foot waves.
   Officials identified the four men as Ray F. Piglia Jr., 27, of

Roos, 43, of Nacogdoches, Texas; and Curt Helms, 40, of Cameron, La.

<HEAD>Jackson Says He May Run For White House In 1992</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, defeated in his bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination, says he ``was a heartbeat away
from the presidency'' and suggests he will run for the White House
in 1992 if Michael Dukakis loses.
   ``If Michael Dukakis loses on Tuesday, the next political season
will begin on Wednesday,'' Jackson said in an interview with the
Chicago Sun-Times published in Sunday's editions.
   In the Sun-Times interview, Jackson said he feels Dukakis can
still defeat Republican George Bush, but if he doesn't, the
Chicagoan is looking at a third run for the White House.
   ``I came within a stone's throw of winning my party's
nomination,'' Jackson said. ``I was a heartbeat away from the
presidency.
   ``I will continue to serve. The full scope of my leadership has
yet to blossom and flourish. I have a belief in my leadership. I
take my leadership from the people.''
   Since the Democratic convention in July, Jackson said he has
traveled to 60 cities in 29 states in support of Dukakis, speaking
before more than 745,000 people.
   ``Nobody worked harder for this ticket than I did,'' he said.
   Jackson said a revision of the party's delegate-selection rules,
including the elimination of more than 300 appointed superdelegates
to the convention, would help his candidacy in 1992.
   ``I always fare better with the people than with the political
elite,'' he said referring to the fact that most superdelegates are
elected officials.

   A graduate student suspected of creating a
``virus'' that invaded computer nerve centers nationwide, started
playing with computers in his teens and has been fascinated with
them since, his father said Saturday.
   But Robert Morris Sr., a top government computer-security expert,
refused to comment on whether his son, Robert Morris Jr., 23,
concocted the virus that clogged an estimated 6,000 military and
university machines.
   At any rate, he said, the episode may prevent a serious security
breach in the future.
   ``It's going to be remembered for a long time,'' said the elder
Morris, chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center in
Bethesda, Md. ``And I think we'll see a substantial improvement in
the way computers and networks are administered.''
   In an interview at their home in Arnold, about 25 miles southeast
of Baltimore, Robert's mother, Anne Morris, said her son got his
first summer job working with computers when he was 15, and a series
of similar summer jobs followed.
   As children, all three of the Morris youngsters read a science
fiction book called ``Shock Wave Rider'' that was the first
publication to raise questions about computer viruses in his own
mind.
   ``That was one of the most tattered books in our kids' room,''
Mrs. Morris said.
   Both parents said their son is a likable, attractive young man
who is ``highly skilled'' with computers.
   The elder Morris said the virus episode will ``clearly raise the
awareness of the existing vulnerabilities, particularly of network
systems.''
   Morris also said he felt ambivalent about the incident.
   ``I'm close to this in two ways,'' he said. ``I myself am a
computer user but I'm also a father. That makes it difficult to
separate the two roles, although, of course, they have to be
separated.''
   Morris said he is convinced the virus was unleashed accidentally.
   ``It seems there was no malicious intent involved. No harm was
intended or actually done in the host computers, other than
overload, and that appears to be a design error,'' he said.
   However, he said both he and his son are taking steps to obtain
legal representation.
   Morris, who attends Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., could not
be reached for comment Saturday. His roommate said Morris did not
come home Friday and she did not know where he was. University
officials also were unable to contact him, Lynn said.
   Morris Sr. said his son is ``simply unavailable ... and will
remain unavailable until he has time to retain a lawyer.''

   A Cornell University graduate student whose
father is a top government computer-security expert is suspected of
creating the ``virus'' that slowed thousands of computers
nationwide, school officials said Saturday.
   Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, a first-year student in a doctorate
computer science program, has a reputation as an expert computer
hacker and is skilled enough to have written the rogue program,
Cornell instructor Dexter Kozen said.
   The New York Times quoted sources as saying Morris created the
virus, which on Wednesday night began infecting an estimated 6,000
university and military computers connected through the Arpanet
computer network established by the Pentagon.
   The virus slowed down computers by replicating itself over and
over and taking up memory space, but it is not believed to have
destroyed any data.
   The origin of such programs is hard to investigate, and it may be
impossible to trace the virus back to Morris, said M. Stuart Lynn,
vice president of information technologies at Cornell.
   ``At this stage we're simply not in a position to determine if
the allegations are true,'' Lynn said at a news conference. He said
he did not know how long the investigation would take.
   ``It's quite conceivable we may not be able to say with any
certainty'' if the virus was created in Cornell's computer system,
he said.
   He said the university had been contacted by the FBI, but there
was no indication any criminal charges would be filed. Officials
said the school could discipline Morris if he was involved.
   The FBI said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to determine
whether federal law had been violated.
   Morris could not be reached for comment Saturday. His roommate,
Chansong Da, said Morris did not come home Friday and she did not
know where he was. University officials also were unable to contact
him, Lynn said.
   Reached at his home Saturday in Arnold, Md., Robert T. Morris
Sr., chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center in
Bethesda, Md., would not say where his son was.
   Morris told The Washington Post his son is ``simply unavailable
... and will remain unavailable until he has time to retain a
lawyer.''
   Morris Sr. said he met with FBI agents for about an hour Saturday
to explain why his son will not immediately comply with their
request. He said the family has had preliminary discussions with an
attorney and expects to hire one by Monday.
   Morris said he is in regular contact with his son and that they
have discussed the allegations.
   ``I certainly will not report anything of our conversations,'' he
said. ``I am simply not in a position to deny or confirm the
allegations. I have no direct knowledge.''
   A federal law enforcement official confirmed Saturday that the
FBI is attempting to determine what role Morris' son may have played
in creating the virus. The inquiry is ``rapidly developing right
now,'' the official said.
   The elder Morris has written widely on the security of the Unix
operating system, the target of his son's virus program, the Times
reported. He is widely known for writing a program to decipher
passwords, which give users access to computers.
   Cornell officials said they began examining Morris' computer
files Friday night after the Times identified him.
   Morris had passwords in his files ``for some computers at Cornell
and Stanford to which he is not entitled,'' although those could
have been placed there by someone else, Lynn said.
   A computer file dated Oct. 26 found in Cornell's system Saturday
is the earliest indication that Morris may have been writing the
program that spawned the virus, Lynn said.
   The Times reported in its Sunday editions that friends of Morris'
said he quickly realized the virus program was out of hand and that
he arranged for a friend to send out instructions oh how to
eradicate the virus.
   The instructions, however, were posted on a so-called electronic
bulletin board that few people would see, the newspaper said.
   The purpose of the virus program was to spread a tiny program
throughout the country and the rest of the world and have it
secretly take up residence in computers' memories, the paper said.
The program was to always ``hide'' in the background to escape
detection.
   It probably wasn't a malicious act, said Dean Krafft, research
associate in computer science at Cornell.
   ``It would have been extremely simple to take this virus
structure one step further so that it was extremely destructive,''
Krafft said. ``With a couple more lines (in the program) it could
have wiped out files in all 6,000 computers.''
   The computers affected by the virus all used the Unix 4.3
operating system program, a modification of the Unix system
developed by AT&T that was produced by the University of California
at Berkeley. Unix operating systems are the most popular software
for workstation and medium sized computers.
   If it was Morris, he ``apparently found a gaping hole in the
system that I'm amazed no one exploited before,'' Kozen said. While
the loophole in the system was not evident before the virus was
unleashed, ``in retrospect it's really quite obvious.''
   ``He is reputed to be a good hacker, and I guess this would be
the proof of it if it's found that he did cause (the virus),'' Kozen
said.
   Bob Ford, a spokesman for Bell Laboratories, said the younger
Morris worked in the company's Computing Science Research Center at
Murray Hill during the summers of 1983 and 1984 and that his job
included writing computer programs.
   The Times quoted computer scientists as saying one of Morris'
projects at AT&T was rewriting security software for most computers
that run the Unix system.
   The summers were before and after Morris' freshman year at
Harvard University, where he received his undergraduate degree, Ford
said. Morris lived in Millington, N.J. at the time.
   ``From what I hear, he is extremely bright, obviously,'' Ford
said. ``The code he worked on was intended for internal use only.
The programs were not intended for use outside of Bell Labs.
   Ford said the elder Morris worked at Bell Labs at Murray Hill and
Whippany for 26 years before retiring in 1986.
   Some computer centers were forced to disconnect from Arpanet and
shut computers down, but by Friday most reported that the virus had
been eradicated.
   However, at the University of Illinois, researchers decided
Friday evening to pull off Arpanet ``for the duration.''
   ``This virus has too many skills and it's not worth the risk,''
said Paul Pomes, a research programmer at the school. Experts there
thought they had defeated the virus, only to find that the system
had been reinfected.
   Some researchers said the virus had several variations and that
it was making an effort to capture passwords and break the ``super
user'' code, which allows a user to work on a system with no
restrictions at all.
   Despite his reputation as a hacker, Morris was an average student
who kept to himself, according to faculty and fellow students.
   ``I haven't seen too much of him in my course,'' Kozen said.
``He's said to be brilliant but that's directed to a certain area
and that area is not his classes. I get the feeling he doesn't waste
too much time on homework, but put him at a keyboard and he's a
whiz.''

<HEAD>Sharpton, Others Call For Indictments In 1985 MOVE Bombing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton led a group of emotional
speakers Saturday in a call for the arrest of Mayor W. Wilson Goode
and others for their part in the 1985 MOVE bombing.
   Attorney Alton Maddox Jr. would not be specific about the group's
plans to protest the lack of indictments by two grand juries, but he
said he, Sharpton and others would continue speaking out until
officials who directed the police siege of the group's fortified
west Philadelphia row house are convicted.
   ``The person who called for the bombing must be arrested
immediately, indicted immediately and convicted immediately, and the
first person who must go to jail is Wilson Goode,'' Maddox said.
   A Philadelphia County grand jury and a federal grand jury both
decided not to return any indictments in the May 1985 bombing, which
started a fire that left 11 people dead in the MOVE house and
destroyed 61 homes.
   Earlier in the week, Sharpton said a lawsuit would be filed on
behalf of Louise James and Laverne Simms, whose brother, MOVE leader
John Africa, died in the confrontation. Ms. James owned the MOVE
house, but did not live there at the time of the bombing. The
rebuilt house has since been confiscated.
   Maddox would not say whether there are definite plans to file
suit, but said he and Sharpton are seeking a Congressional inquiry
into the bombing.
   Goode declined extensive comment after the federal grand jury
released its findings, saying at the time, ``Two grand juries have
fully investigated this matter and have reached a point of no
criminality involved. For that I am pleased.''
   Neither Goode nor his press secretary, Karen Warrington, could be
reached for comment Saturday night. Neither has a listed phone
number.
   ``The same grand jury system that has plagued us in New York and
rendered a very racist and Nazi-like verdict in the Tawana Brawley
case has even more so returned a ruthless verdict to these two
women,'' Sharpton said, referring to Ms. James and Ms. Simms.
   Sharpton and Maddox have served as advisers to Miss Brawley, 16,
who was found last fall with dog feces spread on her and racial
slurs scratched in her skin. She said she had been abducted and
raped by six white men, some of whom were flashing police-like
badges. A New York grand jury recently ruled Miss Brawley, who
refused to testify before the panel, fabricated the story.
   Sharpton and the others spoke to about 100 people at a west
Philadelphia nightclub Saturday.
   Ms. James began sobbing when she recalled identifying the bodies
of her son and brother who died in the MOVE bombing.
   ``There were two gurneys. One with what was left of my son and on
another a torso _ no head, no legs,'' she said.
   She chastised Philadelphia residents for not coming to her aid in
the three years since the bombing and said it was a shame she had to
go to New York to find a champion for her cause in Sharpton.
   Sharpton said he is just now stepping forward on the issue
because the federal grand jury declined to issue an indictment in
September.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Saturday exercised a pocket
veto of legislation that would have limited advertising during
children's TV shows and required stations to provide informative
programming for youngsters.
   The president said in a statement that while he supports efforts
to improve the quality of children's programs, ``this bill simply
cannot be reconciled with the freedom of expression secured by our
Constitution.''
   The bill, which passed the Senate on a voice vote in October and
the House by a 328-78 margin in June, would have reimposed
advertising limits abandoned by the Federal Communications
Commission four years ago. The FCC had said the marketplace itself
could best regulate commercials.
   ``While I applaud efforts to increase the amount and quality of
children's television programming, the Constitution simply does not
empower the federal government to oversee the programming decisions
of broadcasters in the manner prescribed by this bill,'' Reagan said
in his statement.
   Children's TV advocates had pressed for passage of the
legislation, maintaining that under the FCC's philosophy of
deregulation, advertising during children's shows has increased and
the quality of the programs has deteriorated.
   Peggy Charren, president of the Cambridge, Mass.-based Action for
Children's Television which has pushed for the bill for 20 years,
said the veto was ``another example of ideological child abuse in
the Reagan administration.''
   ``The ultimate effect of the veto is that we will continue to
have a broadcast industry that spends all its time figuring how to
benefit from children instead of how to benefit children,'' she said.
   The bill would have limited commercials in children's program to
10{ minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on
weekdays. Stations would have had until 1990 to comply with the
advertising limits.
   It also would have required stations to ``serve the educational
and information needs of children'' in their overall programming.
The FCC would evaluate those efforts in considering whether to renew
stations licenses.
   Reagan, in his veto message, said that ``conditioning license
renewals upon the federal government's determination as to the
adequacy of a licensee's programming would violate the First
Amendment.''
   ``It would inhibit broadcasters from offering innovative programs
that do not fit neatly into regulatory categories and discourage the
creation of programs that might not satisfy the tastes of agency
officials responsible for considering license renewals,'' he said.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick had said the legislation was
``unnecessary and ill-advised,'' particularly because the commission
was considering taking action on its own related to the
commercialization of children's television.
   The legislation was a bipartisan compromise that had been
stripped of a proposal to prohibit programs that feature toy
manufacturers' products. Critics call such shows ``program-length
commercials.''
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, which helped craft the compromise, said of the bill:
``While we recognize this legislation charted some new territory we
were willing to accept its outcome.''
   ``Frankly, we expected the president to sign it.'' Fritts said.
``Under any circumstances, we are very sensitive to our
responsibility to provide quality programming to children and we
will continue to do so with or without legislation.''
   Reagan also signed a number of other measures that won
legislative approval in the waning days of the 100th Congress:
   _ A law banning the sale of lawn darts, a game that is blamed for
the deaths of three children and injuries to thousands of others.
The bill requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to carry
out the ban, which is moving to do so on its own.
   _ The so-called ``Bork bill,'' designed to protect the privacy of
video store customers by prohibiting the unauthorized release of
information about what tapes they rent or purchase.
   The bill grew out of last year's hearings on the nomination of
Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court. During the deliberations, a
weekly newspaper in Washington, D.C., obtained and published the
video rental records of Bork, whose nomination ultimately was
rejected by the Senate.
   _ A law banning the shipment of real-looking toy guns and of
imitation guns unless they have a blaze orange plug in the barrel.
The law was enacted in part because of shootings in which imitations
were mistaken for real weapons.
   _ A law extending for two years the temporary authority for cash
awards by inspectors general to federal employees whose disclosures
of fraud and mismanagement result in cost savings to the government.
   _ A law designating certain lands and waters in Pettaquamscutt
Cove, R.I., a National Wildlife Refuge.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
pressed communist authorities to open negotiations with the
opposition during her visit to Poland but also advised the
opposition to act with restraint.
   The Conservative Party prime minister, who returned home late
Friday after a three-day visit, performed a balancing act in her
meetings with government officials and leaders of the outlawed
Solidarity union movment.
   She declared she had no intention of meddling in the country's
internal affairs but then encouraged social strivings for greater
freedom and human rights while urging the government to stay tough
in restructuring its economy.
   After her visit ended, the official PAP news agency reported
public opinion polls showed Mrs. Thatcher was viewed favorably by 52
percent of the Polish population, which it said made her more
popular in Poland than in Britain.

   A treaty banning genocide finally has the force
of U.S. law, bringing to a close 40 years of opposition by
conservatives and putting a final feather in the political cap of
retiring Sen. William Proxmire.
   President Reagan signed legislation Friday to implement the
treaty, which was ratified by the Senate on Feb. 11, 1986. By the
time the Senate acted, 95 other nations had ratified the treaty. The
implementing legislation was passed last month.
   Proxmire had delivered more than 3,000 speeches over 19 years
before the ratification vote. Conservatives fought it all the way.
They contended the treaty undermined rights of Americans under the
Constitution and infringed on U.S. sovereignty.
   The legislation signed by Reagan implements the treaty by making
genocide _ the deliberate destruction of a specific population _
punishable under U.S. law and setting stern penalties for violators.

   A Pentagon audit says vague guidelines are to
blame for millions of dollars in questionable payments to major
defense contractors for work performed by outside consultants.
   Defense Contract Audit Agency, in a review of 12 of the top 100
defense contractors, questioned the validity of claims for $43
million out of the $236.5 million charged to the government over the
past year for consultants.
   A separate audit, by the Pentagon Inspector General's office,
estimated that an Air Force logistics center in Georgia paid an
estimated $104 million for spare parts that did not meet contract
specifications, amounting to 89 percent of its inventory.
   The review of consultants' fees by the Defense Contract agency
involved 12 major contractors: Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp.,
Hughes Aircraft Co., IBM Inc., Litton Industries Inc., Lockheed
Corp., Martin Marietta Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp., Northrop
Corp., Raytheon Co., UNISYS Corp., and United Technologies Corp.

   Ground-breaking reforms in Soviet Lithuania are
fueling cautious hope among Lithuanian emigres, but also stirring
discord over the prospect that some degree of independence may be on
the horizon.
   ``We are all a little bit shocked'' by the changes, said Algis
Klimaitis, a Lithuanian dissident who lives in France and works with
the Baltic World Council. He said some people are too quick to
accept the Soviet reforms, ``and some people are too skeptical. We
must find a middle way.''
   The debate over tactics has heated up in the last two weeks
following an inaugural conference in the Lithuanian capital of
Vilnius of the officially sanctioned Movement for Restructuring,
which takes its name from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's plan
of economic and social reform.
   About 20,000 people gathered for the Oct. 22-23 conference, where
more than 1,000 delegates, including many Communist Party members,
adopted resolutions demanding sweeping reforms for Lithuania,
already one of the most progressive of the 15 Soviet republics.

<HEAD>A Penny Saved Is No Way To Invest In Copper</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in cycle with ADD containing weekly
price trends</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   With copper at record-high prices near $1.50 a pound, you could
convert your life savings to pennies, sell them as scrap and pocket
a nice piece of change, right?
   Wrong.
   The economics of the recycling business aside, you'd have to melt
nearly $73 worth of today's pennies to extract a pound of copper.
According to the U.S. Mint, today's pennies are 2.5 percent copper
and 97.5 percent zinc.
   Pre-1982 pennies are 95 percent copper. But at 181 pennies to the
pound, even the copper-rich oldies won't be worth more than their
face value unless copper's value surpasses $1.92 _ and it might.
   Some analysts are even talking about $2 copper, which does not
seem far-fetched considering the metal's dramatic gains over the
past two years. In November 1986, copper for spot delivery on New
York's Commodity Exchange was worth about 60 cents a pound. Spot
copper closed Friday on the Comex at $1.49.
   Many experts expect the worldwide copper shortage caused by
lagging production and labor disputes to persist until the second
half of 1989, which means copper likely will remain a bull market
for some time.
   But there are ways other than penny-pinching to profit from it.
   Unlike the array of investment vehicles available for precious
metals, investing in copper is pretty much limited to futures,
stocks and the physical copper market.
   Copper futures are traded on the Comex in 25,000-pound lots.
Futures traders agree to buy and sell these huge amounts of copper
for future delivery but they almost always cash out of the market
before the delivery date.
   Small-investor participation in the copper futures market has
surged in the past year and continues to grow, said James Steel,
metals-market analyst with Refco Inc., a large Chicago-based
commodities brokerage firm.
   ``A lot of small traders have picked up on this market,'' he
said. The number keeps growing, he said, ``as the market continues
to throw out more and more bullish signals.''
   Trading in copper stocks also has increased, said David Burgher,
an analyst with Barrett Day Securities Inc. in New York.
   Shares of Phoenix, Ariz.-based Phelps Dodge Corp., the world's
largest copper producer, reached an all-time high of $49.50 this
past week on the New York Stock Exchange after beginning the year at
$32.50, Burgher said.
   Asarco Inc., another large U.S. copper producer, is trading
around $29.50 after hitting a low of $29.37{ earlier this year, he
said.
   Between the worldwide shortage and the 2{-week-old copper miners'
strike in Peru, ``I think copper is going to go much higher,''
Burgher said.
   Copper recycling is also on the rise. The Institute of the Scrap
Recycling Industry, a Washington-based trade association, estimated
that the amount of copper recovered from scrap will rise about 5
percent this year to 3.314 million tons from 3.152 million tons in
1987.
   Industrial scrap accounts for the bulk of copper recycling but
``back-yard recyclers'' also are getting into the act, said Norm
Schroeder, associate editor of American Metal Market, a daily
newspaper of the scrap metal industry.
   ``There's been an increase in the collection of obsolete copper
scrap _ old electrical wire, copper tubing,'' Schroeder said.
``People like electricians and plumbers save it and sell it when the
price gets high _ and the markets real right, right now.''
   But several scrap brokers contacted by The Associated Press said
they had no interest in recycling pennies.
   ``It's barely worth stooping over to pick up a penny,'' said
David Egly, president of Ace Iron & Metals Inc. of Joliet, Ill.

   As voters head to the polls to elect a new

coffers.
   Up for sale to Wall Street's biggest brokers, and later to be
sold by them to the public, are $19 billion in three- and 10-year
notes and $11 billion of 37-day cash management bills.
   But absent again from the three-day quarterly refinancing
schedule, which begins on Election Day, is the 30-year bond.
   As was the case in the previous auction, the government lacked
the authority to issue any more long bonds. However, the Treasury
hopes to sell $9 billion of them later this month or early in
December after President Reagan signs an authorizing tax bill.
   Proceeds from the election-week sale will be used toward raising
$2.2 billion in new cash and refinancing $16.8 billion in old debt,
part of the $2.6 trillion national debt.
   Economists are split as to how the auction might go, since it
comes at a time of great uncertainty as the nation elects a new
leader and interest rates continue to rise.
   Most, though, agree that yields will have to be high enough to
attract domestic and foreign money.
   ``I think the yield levels will be more attractive from an
investor's standpoint,'' said F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial
economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   And if his forecast is correct, that interest rates will ease up
after the election, that should be especially sweet for buyers at
this quarter's auction. ``But patience has to be exhibited,'' he
warned.
   Economists agree a potential saving grace of the auction will be
the absence of the 30-year bond.
   ``Too many things are happening and none of them are good for
bonds,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko
Securities Co. International.
   ``Not having a long bond is probably a great help because it's a
high-risk piece of paper and hard to adjust so quickly in front of
changing economic circumstances.''
   The bellwether 30-year bond plunged in value and its rate soared
Friday after the government reported that the nation's October
unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 5.3 percent _ the
lowest level since May 1984.
   The credit markets were unnerved by the fact the report showed
employers added 325,000 new jobs last month, an indication that the
manufacturing sector of the economy remains strong and higher
inflation may not be far behind.
   But some economists argue the markets have overreacted a bit.
   ``There are two sides to this economy,'' said David Resler, chief
economist for Nomura Securities International Inc. ``The production
side is rolling along at a good clip. (But) there are signs that
point to a slowdown in demand from the consumer sector ... and that
should prevent inflation.''
   Still, he and others concede whatever voters decide at the polls
can change even the best-prepared economic forecasts.

<HEAD>Dollar Hurt by Signs of Weakening Economy, Election Anxiety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar's summer radiance has turned as pale
as the withered late-autumn leaves.
   Pessimism about the dollar's outlook intensified this past week,
not only because of evidence the economy is slowing down, but also
over uncertainties about the monetary policies of the next
president, whoever he may be.
   Although the dollar rose Friday on surprisingly strong October
employment figures reported by the Labor Department, many currency
strategists said they believe the dollar's value will continue to
erode.
   This assessment represents a shift from about three weeks ago in
how the world viewed the dollar, which was strong and resilient
through the summer and part of the fall.
   The selling pressure hurt the dollar especially in the beginning
of the week, despite efforts by the central banks of Japan and the
United States to stem the weakness by purchasing dollars in the
foreign exchange markets.
   Much of the reason lies in government economic statistics that
point to a slowdown in what had been a modestly expanding economy.
   Late last month, for example, the Commerce Department said
third-quarter growth slowed to 2.2 percent, the lowest in nearly two
years. Last Tuesday the department said its Index of Leading
Indicators forecasting gauge fell 0.1 percent in September, the
third drop in five months.
   This suggested that the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank,
would not be forced to pre-empt inflation by raising interest rates.
Such a move at least in the short term would have boosted the
dollar's value by making dollar-denominated investments worth more.
   After trading at about 130 Japanese yen and more than 1.85 West
German marks in the middle of October, the dollar has since fallen
to about 125 yen, a nearly 4 percent decline, and 1.79 marks, a 3.2
percent drop.
   ``I think you have to say concern about the economy is the main
reason,'' said Stephen Leach, currency analyst for Chemical Bank in
New York.
   ``When you go back to the summer and say why was the dollar
strong, it was because of relatively high interest rates and
expectations of higher interest rates to come,'' he said. ``Now
people are coming around to the view that we haven't been getting
higher rates and perhaps getting lower rates.''
   Another important reason for the dollar's most recent
depreciation is the Tuesday presidential election, many strategists
say.
   Although most believe Republican George Bush will win over
Democrat Michael Dukakis, both candidates have offered only vague
ideas for how to reduce America's swollen trade and budget deficits,
key areas of concern that have battered the dollar's value in the
past.
   ``Everybody is bearish on the dollar,'' said William Harrington,
senior foreign exchange analyst at the Wefa Group, an economic
forecasting concern in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``Earlier, financial markets would have viewed a Bush victory as
much more of a boost for the dollar and the capital markets. Now
they're not so sure,'' Harrington said. ``We're not hearing
convincing stories on either side on how the deficits will be
reduced.''
   Even if Bush were to promote a sound plan for reducing the
deficits, Harrington said, ``a Democratic Congress will be ready to
give George Bush back his own. They are going to resist legislation
he proposes.''
   Though a Dukakis victory is considered increasingly remote, the
dollar likely would tumble if he won, largely because his
supervision over the unwieldy U.S. economy is untested, other
currency strategists said.
   ``At this point, Bush is more of a known commodity, whereas a
Dukakis administration is a total unknown,'' said Thomas F.
Carpenter, vice president and chief economist for ASB Capital
management, a Washington-based investment advisory service. ``Even
the people in a Dukakis administration wouldn't be sure how they'd
manage policy if they got in.''
   Despite the prevalent view that the dollar will decline,
Carpenter said the Friday unemployment report showing joblessness
hit a 14-year low of 5.3 percent last month may have diluted some of
the pessimism about the currency and at least keep it stable for a
while beyond the election.
   ``Everybody involved in pricing financial assets all bought the
slowdown thesis,'' he said. ``What remains now, if you're an
optimist, is that the economy's doing well, not booming, not
weakening.''

<HEAD>Election Puts Wall Street in Cold Sweat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arrival of November plunged the stock market
from a raging fever into a cold sweat.
   In the wake of ``takeover fever,'' which swept through Wall
Street in October's final days, a chill settled in this past week
when the market began to nervously count down the days until
Tuesday's presidential election.
   Many institutional investors clung to the sidelines, leaving the
field to professionals and putting a damper on trading volume.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials barely stirred all week,
finishing with a net loss of 4.09 points at 2,145.80.
   Although Wall Street expects George Bush _ its favored candidate
_ to win, there's been enough uncertainty to keep investors on edge.
Political poll-watching seems to have replaced technical
chart-watching for the moment.
   The market came to life briefly on Thursday, when the shaky
dollar stabilized and the Dow average brushed against the 2,178 mark
before ending the day at 2,170.34.
   Then on Friday, new unemployment data showing surprising strength
in the economy drove the blue-chip indicator down 24.54 points. The
government reported that the nation's jobless rate fell to 5.3
percent in October, the lowest level in 14 years, as the economy
created more than 300,000 jobs.
   Through most of the week, anticipation of the jobless data had
given the market another thing to worry about and deepened its
pre-election anxiety.
   ``People sort of threw in the towel for this week,'' said Philip
Puccio, a senior vice president of Dillon, Read & Co.
   Once the hoopla of the election is over, Wall Street probably
will pick up where it left off before the takeover frenzy hit _
worrying about interest rates.
   Early in the week, many observers had been expecting the Federal
Reserve to keep credit policy and interest rates stable in the near
future. Recent signs that the economy is slowing and inflationary
pressures are easing would make the Fed loathe to push interest
rates higher, they believed.
   That view gained credence Monday when Martha R. Seger, a member
of the Fed's Board of Governors, estimated that the U.S. economy has
slowed in the third quarter and will grow by 1 percent to 2 percent
next year.
   Seger told the Economic Club of Detroit that recent economic data
have allayed fears of rekindled inflation.
   But a recent slide in the dollar raised concern that the central
bank could nudge interest rates higher to bolster the U.S. currency.
Although the dollar steadied late in the week, the fear of higher
rates was rekindled by Friday's unemployment figures.
   ``The level of short-term interest rates remains the most
important likely determinant of stock prices,'' says Robert J.
Nurock, publisher of the Astute Investor newletter out of Paoli, Pa.
``Lower short-term rates would help stimulate business.''
   Besides the stagnant Dow, other readings for the week showed the
New York Stock Exchange composite index down 1.38 at 155.70, the
NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market down 1.75 at
381.02, and the American Stock Exchange market value index off 2.28
at 297.52.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 150.50 million shares a day,
down from 170.03 million the week before.
