   President-elect Bush is halfway through picking
his Cabinet with the selection of former Texas Sen. John Tower as
defense secretary and he now is focusing on candidates to run the
government's housing, health and transportation agencies.
   Trying to wrap up major appointments before Christmas, Bush is
expected to announce at least three more Cabinet choices early next
week.
   These will include conservative Rep. Jack Kemp of New York as
secretary of housing and urban development and Chicago mass-transit
official Samuel Skinner as secretary of transportation, sources
involved in the transition said Friday.
   They also said health educator Louis Sullivan continues to be the
leading candidate for secretary of health and human services but had
not been offered the job. If chosen, he would be the first black in
Bush's Cabinet.
   Moreover, former Republican Rep. Henson Moore of Louisiana was
said by sources to be a leading candidate to become Energy Secretary.
   Sources also reported Bush had chosen Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon
and former Democratic Rep. Thomas (Lud) Ashley of Ohio to be his
appointees to the National Economic Commission, which is charged
with recommending ways to reduce the federal deficit. Bellmon is a
former senator who once served as ranking Republican on the Budget
Committee, while Ashley has been a friend of the president-elect
since their days together at Yale.
   In naming Tower to the Pentagon, Bush said Friday he was
``totally satisfied'' with Tower's fitness to serve after a detailed
FBI background check into his connections with the defense industry
as well as with allegations of womanizing and drinking problems.
   Tower, commenting on the allegations, said ``I got up every
morning and laughed myself silly over what I was reading in the
newspapers.''
   Bush, predicting the selection would be greeted with ``wide
support abroad and at home,'' said he believed Tower had been
strengthened by the ordeal. He said the exhaustive investigation
into Tower's professional and personal life had yielded a ``clean
bill of health.''
   After announcing the choice of Tower, Bush fielded questions from
reporters.
   He said that ``there is no expectation that we will or won't''
have a summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
next year. He said he didn't want to signal unwillingness to build
on recent progress in U.S.-Soviet relations, but also didn't want to
``send out the other signal'' of acting too hastily.
   Bush also said he ``wouldn't overstate the importance'' of the
U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization that opened
Friday in Tunisia. He stressed that the Reagan administration has
embarked on a dialogue and not a negotiation.
   Tower was the seventh Cabinet member named by Bush, leaving seven
slots still unfilled.
   Tower said that in running the Pentagon, he would have to produce
``as much if not more defense for less money.''
   Tower hinted at manpower reductions throughout the armed
services. But, he stressed, ``I would not advocate, for the
immediate future, any significant troop reduction in Europe.''
   The appointment completes Bush's selection of a national security
team. He previously named former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III as secretary of state, chose retired Air Force Gen. Brent
Scowcroft as national security adviser and said he would retain
William Webster as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Tower has held a variety of sensitive posts since retiring from
the Senate in 1985, including stints as an arms control negotiator
for President Reagan and as head of a review board, popularly known
as the Tower Commission, appointed by Reagan to probe the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Some conservative critics have contended that Tower's support for
the Reagan administration's Star Wars plan for a land and
space-based shield against missiles has been lukewarm.
   Tower told reporters that ``I don't have any reservations'' about
the Strategic Defense Initiative. However, he added, ``I understand
the value of SDI, not just as a deterrent potential but also as a
very, very valuable negotiating tool.''
   Asked if that meant he thought of it only as a bargaining chip
for arms-reduction talks, he responded, ``Not a chip, leverage,
negotiating leverage.''
   In another development, a transition source said campaign
strategist Robert Teeter, who is serving as co-chairman of Bush's
transition team, has ended many days of deliberation and decided to
go to the White House as deputy chief of staff.

<HEAD>Vietnam Veteran to Lead Prosecution At North Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnam war veteran has been selected as lead
trial prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case against fellow former
Marine and ex-White House aide Oliver L. North.
   John W. Keker, 44, who like North was wounded while leading a
Marine infantry platoon in action, was chosen on Friday by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to head a three-lawyer team
that will try North.
   Walsh had said he would like to try the North case himself. But
he said in a statement Friday that he would continue to deal with
problems posed by a wealth of classified documents and supervise the
continuing investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Walsh's spokesman, James Wieghart, said Keker's war record, which
was not mentioned in the statement, was coincidental to his being
named head of the prosecution team.
   But Keker's Purple Heart for his combat wound is a serendipitous
qualification for the lead prosecutor in the case against North, who
has made patriotism and his own Vietnam service a hallmark of his
public defense since the Iran-Contra affair unfolded two years ago.
   North, 44, who earned two Purple Hearts for combat wounds, wore
his Marine uniform when he testified before the congressional
committees that investigated the arms-for-hostages deals.
   Walsh announced his courtroom team in advance of a hearing next
Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to begin final
preparations for North's trial, which could begin as early as late
January.
   The former National Security Council aide, who retired from the
Marines as a lieutenant colonel following his indictment last March,
is accused of conspiring to illegally divert profits from the
U.S.-Iran arms deals to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Keker, who is on leave from his San Francisco law firm, will be
joined by associate independent counsels David A. Zornow, 33, and
Michael W. Bromwich, 34, both former federal prosecutors in New York
City.
   Zornow investigated and helped try several major municipal
corruption cases in New York.
   ``This commits three of our most experienced criminal lawyers to
the case,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh repeatedly had expressed an interest in trying the case
against North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter
and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.
   But Gesell's decision to order separate trials for each of the
defendants and the continuing complications of classified documents
and congressional immunity given North, Poindexter and Hakim forced
a re-examination of those plans, according to a source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Besides the original grand jury that indicted North and his
co-defendants, a new panel began meeting this fall to consider
possible perjury by participants in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Walsh must be free to oversee the investigations and negotiate
with intelligence agencies about disclosing classified information
that Gesell says must be included in the proof against North.
   Christian J. Mixter, who has been handling the prosecution's case
during closed proceedings on secret documents in the North case, was
named a member of the team of lawyers for Poindexter's trial.
   Keker joined the Marine Corps upon graduation from Princeton
University in 1965 and was commissioned a second lieutenant. Sent to
Vietnam in 1966, he was wounded while leading an infantry platoon
near the Demilitarized Zone. He left the Marines in 1967 and studied
law at Yale University.
   He later served as law clerk to retired Supreme Court Chief
Justice Earl Warren.

<HEAD>LaRouche Says Conviction is `Obscene Miscarriage of Justice'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political maverick Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
says his conviction of tax and mail fraud conspiracy is ``a wrong,
gross, disgusting, obscene miscarriage of justice,'' and predicted
he will die a martyr's death if sent to prison.
   ``They don't want a living political martyr in prison, they want
a dead one,'' said LaRouche, claiming he was the victim of a hate
campaign by the news media and a frameup by a pro-Soviet ``friends
of glasnost'' clique in the Justice and State departments.
   LaRouche, 66, a perennial fringe candidate for president, told
reporters he felt no remorse or sympathy for his followers, many of
them elderly people, who had loaned his organization millions of
dollars and gotten little or none of their money back.
   ``They have been wronged, not by us but by the government,'' he
said, explaining that when several of his groups were forced into
bankruptcy proceedings in April 1987, the government seized loan
repayment funds.
   After less than 12 hours of deliberation, a federal trial jury on
Friday found LaRouche and six associates guilty of mail fraud and
conspiracy for raising more than $30 million in loans from
supporters without any intention of repaying them.
   In addition, LaRouche was convicted of scheming to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses paid by
various corporations he controls and claiming he had no taxable
income. Government prosecutors said LaRouche has not filed federal
income tax returns for any year since 1978.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. set sentencing for
Jan. 27, and allowed all seven defendants to remain free on their
personal recognizance. LaRouche faces a maximum penalty of 65 years
in prison and fines totaling $3.25 million.
   All seven were found guilty of all 48 counts contained in an
indictment returned by a federal grand jury on Oct. 14 after a
two-year investigation of the LaRouche organization's financial
affairs.
   The six convicted LaRouche associates, who face lesser maximum
penalties, are William Wertz, the leader's chief fund-raiser; Edward
Spannaus, legal coordinator for LaRouche, and fund-raisers Michael
Billington, Paul Greenberg, Joyce Rubinstein and Dennis Small.
   Defense lawyers said they planned to appeal the convictions. They
repeatedly denied that LaRouche had sought to cheat federal tax
collectors, and insisted that his fund-raisers had promised in good
faith that the terms of the loans would be honored.
   Government prosecutors led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent
Robinson said the LaRouche people were lying when they solicited the
loans with promises of prompt payment at preferred interest rates.
   In 1986, they said, LaRouche associates were making an estimated
$500,000 in improvements to his heavily guarded Leesburg, Va.,
estate, including a swimming pool and riding ring, while they were
defaulting on millions of dollars in loans from supporters.
   LaRouche, who did not testify during the four-week trial in U.S.
District Court, stood erect facing the jury of eight women and four
men as a clerk recited their guilty verdict on all 13 counts against
him. He sat down without a word or a gesture.
   Small nodded and smiled almost imperceptibly as he was convicted.
Ms. Rubinstein broke into tears and fell into the arms of a woman
friend after she left the courtroom.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham of Boston said he did not
regard the outcome of the complex, hard-fought court case as a
victory.
   ``I consider this an obvious conclusion to a long pattern of
false statements to trusting senior citizens,'' he said. ``Their
dreams for their retirement are gone. It's a sad case.''
   Defense lawyer Kenly Webster, who represented Spannaus, said the
jury's decision probably was influenced by ``the size of the debt
incurred and the failure to pay that debt back according to the
terms and conditions.''
   The jurors ``probably felt it would be a long time before they
would be paid back, if at all,'' Webster said.
   He speculated that the jury also was influenced by the ``very
controversial views'' held by LaRouche and his supporters on
political issues, which seemed ``inextricably entwined'' with the
defaulted loans issue.
   The LaRouche movement embraces numerous unorthodox positions and
relies heavily on conspiratorial theories to explain world events.
Some adherents have advocated quarantining AIDS victims. Others have
alleged that former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Britain's
Queen Elizabeth are involved in conspiracies.
   At a news conference held in his Alexandria apartment suite
shortly after the verdict was announced, LaRouche said he himself
was the victim of a conspiracy conceived by leftist government
opponents, promoted by liberal dupes in the news media and carried
to a climax Friday by ``a runaway jury ... with no regard for
facts.''
   LaRouche said he was convinced that his conviction is tantamount
to a death sentence at the hands of fellow prison inmates.
   ``The way the jury voted, I'm dead,'' he said, adding that the
government's goal was ``not to put me in prison but to kill me.''
   LaRouche said he will leave behind the legacy of an international
``anti-Bolshevik resistance'' led by followers who are ``prepared to
fight and die to save civilization'' from world conquest by the
communists.
   ``We will kill and die if necessary to restore the kind of
government the founders of this country fought to create,'' he said.
   LaRouche said he and his followers are not afraid to die. ``We
are not a bunch of sentimental slush heads,'' he said.
   A separate criminal case involving LaRouche is scheduled for
retrial in Boston starting Feb. 27. In that case, LaRouche, six
aides and five of his organizations are charged with conspiring to
obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into allegations that
more than $2 million was raised for LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign through credit card and loan fraud.

<HEAD>Tower Backed Defense Buildup, Has Been Defense Consultant</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bush Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush has turned for his defense
secretary to a former senator who strongly backed the military
buildup of the Reagan years and worked as a consultant for major
military contractors after leaving Congress.
   John Tower, a 63-year-old Texan, retired from the Senate in 1985
after 24 years including a stint as chairman of the Armed Services
Committee.
   After leaving the Senate, Tower went into business as a defense
consultant. He also has served as an arms negotiator for President
Reagan, and he headed the White House's Iran-Contra investigative
panel.
   He was widely mentioned as a candidate for the Defense Department
job _ by most accounts the only one he really wanted _ under Reagan.
But Reagan never made the move.
   Tower comes to the job now at a time when the Pentagon faces
acute budget pressures because of the federal budget deficit and the
array of costly new weapons systems developed as part of the
military buildup.
   ``The bottom line is that we must provide at least as much, if
not more, defense for less money,'' Tower said after Bush announced
his nomination Friday.
   The announcement followed a lengthy background check that brought
a public airing of Tower's private life, including an acrimonious
divorce, talk of drinking and womanizing, and questions about the
propriety of naming someone to the job who had worked with so many
defense companies.
   Bush dismissed ``a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless''
and said, ``I am totally satisfied in that regard.''
   The president-elect apparently decided that Tower's extensive
financial ties to weapons companies that he will do business with as
defense secretary was not a bar to service.
   Asked if Tower would stay out of Defense Department matters
involving corporations for whom he has consulted, Bush said, ``I
expect so, but I don't know. I expect he would, just like anybody
coming in. ... I think we'll bend over backward in that regard.''
   According to public records and associates, Tower's consulting
firm of Tower and Associates has been on annual retainer with the
following defense contractors: Martin-Marietta, Textron, LTV
Aerospace and Defense Co., Rockwell International and British
Aerospace.
   In addition, Tower's firm received about $100,000 a year under a
contract for consulting services to Hicks and Associates, a McLean,
Va.-based aerospace consulting firm headed by Donald Hicks, a former
undersecretary of defense.
   Through Hicks' firm, Tower indirectly provided advice to still
more defense contractors.
   Tower's firm received $96,000 a year from LTV. Although other
fees were not revealed, an associate, Richard Billmire, acknowledged
some were in the range of $100,000 a year.
   ``There are some retainers in the neighborhood of that figure,
and others that are substantially less,'' Billmire said.
   Tower also received income from speeches _ about $15,000 each for
the 30 or so a year he gives, according to his agent Joe Cosby.
   He has a second consulting firm, Dallas-based Tower, Eggers and
Greene, which is described as providing financial services and
advice.
   Tower was a former board member of a Dallas bank, First Republic.
With his Dallas firm, Tower was part of a group that unsuccessfully
bid to buy the financially troubled bank before it was taken over by
North Carolina-based NCNB Corp.
   Billmire described Tower's work for the defense contractors as
providing advice on the direction of future defense projects and
advice and information on government budget processes, including the
transfer of money among projects.
   Hicks said he signed a contract for Tower's services in order to
gain the benefit of his advice and opinions about what Congress was
likely to do on defense issues.
   In the Senate, Tower was a supporter of Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative and the MX missile. But he was said to be angered
by the administration's failure to agree on a missile deployment
plan and he moved to block development until an acceptable plan was
found.
   Tower left the arms negotiating post after 14 months, and in late
1986 Reagan named him to head his Iran-Contra investigative panel.
Its report laid part of the blame for affair on Reagan's management
style _ but had little to say about Bush's involvement.
   In naming Tower, Bush was bringing a fellow Texan to the upper
levels of his administration. Tower was the first Republican elected
to the Senate from Texas since Reconstruction. He is a native of
Houston and was a college professor before running for the Senate.
   He was elected in 1961 in a special election to fill Lyndon
Johnson's seat, after Johnson became vice president.

   As a former senator, John Tower will receive a
certain deference at his confirmation hearing as George Bush's new
defense chief. But he may also face serious questioning about his
willingness to shoehorn Pentagon spending into a newly limited
budget.
   ``I would say John Tower will be accorded special respect, but no
special privilege,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the senior
Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Warner told reporters he had consulted with committee chairman
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and that hearings on Tower's nomination would
probably take place the week of Jan. 20. He said while Tower would
undergo careful questioning, he ultimately will be confirmed.
   ``The day after the Senate confirms him he'll move into harness
and step out,'' Warner said. ``He'll require no on-the-job
training.''
   Nunn, in a statement, said the confirmation hearings would focus
on Tower's plans for meeting defense challenges over the next four
years, including who will be appointed to senior Pentagon jobs, how
congressionally mandated reforms will be put in place and how
security will be maintained in a time of tight budgets.
   Some of those who will sit in judgment on Tower when he goes
before the committee were there when Tower chaired the panel during
the first four years of the Reagan administration.
   ``It will be a love feast,'' predicted Frank Gaffney, a former
top Pentagon official now at the Center for Security Policy, a
conservative Washington research organization.
   ``He's tough, he's shrewd, he's smart,'' said one of those former
colleagues, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H. ``He's not likely to be
hoodwinked by the Soviets. He is certainly well prepared in terms of
expertise and experience.''
   One issue likely to emerge during the confirmation hearings is
how the nomination of Melvyn R. Paisley, the former Navy assistant
secretary who is a central figure in the Pentagon procurement
scandal, got past Tower when he chaired the committee.
   Tower has said his panel never was given access to an FBI
background report on Paisley that contained damaging allegations and
might have kept Paisley from getting the senior job. Committee
member Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., has asked President Reagan to
explain why those allegations never surfaced in 1981, when Paisley
was nominated.
   The long FBI background check on Tower, and talk about Bush's
reported desire to put a strong manager in as Tower's
second-in-command, have weakened the new nominee, said Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo. She said that will make him more open to attack
for coziness with the defense industry.
   ``You have a new secretary who never saw a weapons system he
didn't like,'' Schroeder, a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, told reporters. ``He is tainted in being able to run a
tough, aggressive Pentagon.''
   ``Over his career this is not somebody who has staked out a
reputation as a tough, budget-cutting, six gun-toting decision
maker,'' said Gordon Adams, defense director of the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, an independent analysis group.
   ``In the early 1980s, (while chairman of the committee) he signed
off on the biggest peacetime buildup in defense since the end of
World War II. He defended it, he pushed it through,'' Adams said.
   ``The mission today is very different,'' he said. ``It's how do
you get defense spending under control? He's got to be a guy who's
learned how to say no, and I've not seen that in his past.''
   Lawrence Korb, another former Pentagon official now at the
Brookings Institution, a liberal research organization, said Tower
will face a severe test. ``The question is whether he will be able
to put together the team that can take a $400 billion program and
put it into a $300 billion budget,'' Korb said.
   Gaffney, however, said Tower's role should be to advocate
Pentagon spending and fight against cuts.
   ``Tower is not going to have to prove anything except that he has
the wisdom and tenacity to minimize the damage done to national
security by people trying to effect draconian cuts in the defense
budget,'' Gaffney said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a look at John Tower, President-elect
Bush's choice for defense secretary.
   AGE: 63.
   EDUCATION: Tower received his undergraduate degree from
Southwestern University in Texas and did graduate work at Southern
Methodist University and the London School of Economics and
Political Science.
   BACKGROUND: The son of a Methodist minister, Tower was in the
Navy during World War II. After the war, he worked as a radio
announcer and insurance salesman before teaching political science
at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas.
   CONGRESSIONAL SERVICE: He was narrowly elected to the Senate in
1961, winning a special election to fill the seat vacated by Lyndon
B. Johnson when Johnson became vice president. On the Armed Services
Committee, he made a name for himself as an expert on the details of
weapons systems and defense policy. After Republicans gained control
of the Senate in 1980, Tower became committee chairman. He became
the chief legislative champion of Reagan's defense spending build-up
and a deeply conservative critic of the Soviet Union.
   CONSULTANT: He retired in 1984 to become a high-priced Washington
consultant. In November 1986, Reagan picked Tower as chairman of the
three-man presidential commission investigating the Iran-Contra
affair.
   PERSONAL LIFE: A 1987 divorce from his second wife, Lilla, was
granted after a legal battle in which she alleged that Tower had
committed ``marital misconduct'' and carried on affairs during their
10-year marriage. Tower's deposition responding to the charges was
sealed by agreement of both parties. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation conducted an extensive background check into rumors of
Tower's extramarital affairs and drinking.

<HEAD>Professor Says University Erred In Basing Suspension On Vatican
Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA WOMACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catholic University administrators were wrong
to have allowed the Vatican to influence their decision to suspend
an ordained priest from the school's theology department, a Notre
Dame University professor has testified.
   ``The church does not have a juridical role in the academic
world'' because academic freedom is ultimately left to peer
judgment, said Richard P. McBrien, chairman of Notre Dame's theology
department.
   He testified at a non-jury trial Friday in support of the Rev.
Charles E. Curran, who, in a suit against Catholic University,
contends his January 1987 suspension violated his academic freedom.
   Curran's disagreement with church teachings on homosexuality,
birth control and other positions were pubished in his book
``Faithful Dissent.'' Afterward Vatican officials revoked Curran's
``canonical mission'' to teach Catholic theology. Curran sued
Catholic University after it suspended him from its theology
department on grounds that his writings were at odds with the faith.
   Cardinal James A. Hickey, archibishop of Washington and
chancellor of the university, testified on Thursday that the Vatican
had the authority to decide when an ordained priest no longer spoke
for the church.
   Hickey testified that in suspending Curran he was enforcing the
Vatican's order.
   Curran had taught at the school for 22 years.
   Catholic University was founded in 1885 as one of a few
``pontifical universities'' directly governed by the church.
   In his testimony Friday, McBrien said Catholic University's
theological department, which had been held in high regard in recent
years, now enjoys less respect from the U.S. academic community, in
part because of the Curran suspension.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, the former chairman of the board of
trustees of Catholic University, testified Thursday that the
university was compelled by the Vatican's action against Curran to
suspend him from the theology department.
   ``If we were to directly defy the Holy See,'' the school risked
having its charter revoked, said Bernardin, who is now the
archbishop of Chicago.
   The trial continues on Monday, but lawyers representing both
sides said a list of witnesses was being negotiated and had not been
finalized.

<HEAD>ACLU Files Lawsuit In Protest Of Housing Project Sweeps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit
against the city Friday, accusing housing officials of ``systematic
warrantless searches'' of tenants and their visitors in an effort to
crack down on drug selling.
   Chicago Housing Authority officials later agreed to relax some of
the security rules, but the lawsuit was not withdrawn from U.S.
District Court, said agency spokeswoman Katie Kelly.
   The lawsuit stems from a security crackdown by the housing
agency, which is trying to evict squatters and violent gang members
who use the projects as havens for drug deals.
   The lawsuit seeks to stop searches of tenants and their
apartments and to establish ``reasonable regulations'' on visits by
family members and other guests.
   Under the existing regulations, ``all guests of residents in the
building have to sign in with the guard at the front door and show a
piece of valid identification,'' Ms. Kelly said.
   ``The policy has been that guests are asked to leave the building
at midnight and are not allowed in until 9 a.m.,'' she said.
   No overnight guests are allowed unless the tenant has received
prior approval.
   The lawsuit says housing officials and police ``have
indiscriminately detained and searched tenants' persons and homes,
going through drawers closets, personal effects'' and other items.
   ``These searches have been carried out without the consent of the
tenants and any prior notice. If tenants object, they have been
threatened with arrest,'' the ACLU said in a statement.
   The lawsuit cites the case of a tenant who was forced to find
another babysitter for her sister's children after housing officials
ordered the children out of her apartment at midnight.
   Under the new rules, ``The guest upon entry, will identify him or
herself to CHA personnel,'' but will not need a piece of
identification, although the tenant must confirm that the person is
a guest, Ms. Kelly said.
   Overnight visitors would be issued guest cards, and residents
could have long-term guests for a period of up to two weeks.
   Ms. Kelly said the ACLU planned to present the proposals to the
plaintiffs, and planned further discussions with the city.
   ``Our intent in all our security procedures is to provide for the
safety and welfare of our residents and that will continue to be our
objective,'' she said.
   The defendants are the housing agency, the city and police
Superintendent LeRoy Martin.

   A state trooper was shot in the head Friday
night when he responded to a request for help from a sheriff's
department, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.
   David Shawn of Waco was in critical condition at Providence
Hospital in the central Texas city, a spokeswoman said.
   Shawn was shot about 9:30 p.m. when he responded to a McLennan
County sheriff's department call for assistance at Lincoln City, an
unincorporated community near Northcrest, a Waco suburb, the DPS
said.
   One person was arrested and DPS officials said another person
might have been involved.
   Law enforcement agencies began an extensive search, involving
about 200 officers, for the second person, said DPS spokesman Mike
Cox in Austin.
   The initial call from the sheriff's office involved a report of a
man with a gun drawn, authorities said.

   A Navy F-14 fighter jet crashed Friday
night while trying to land. Both crewmen escaped injury, according
to the U.S. Coast Guard.
   The aircraft went down in the Alameda Estuary a short distance
before a runway at the northern end of the island housing the
Alameda Naval Air Station, 5 miles east of San Francisco, said Coast
Guard Lt. Michael Sullivan.
   One crewman was rescued by a passing tugboat, and the other was
picked up by a Coast Guard rescue boat.
   The plane apparently sank.
   Both the pilot and the radar officer were taken to a naval
hospital following the 7 p.m. accident, Sullivan said. Both were in
``very good condition'' and were being observed for possible effects
of shock because they were in the water a short time before rescue.
   It was not known whether either of the men were able to eject
before the crash.
   The F-14, known as the ``Tomcat,'' is a two-seat carrier-based
fighter.

   A man was convicted of criminally negligent
homicide Friday in the karate-kick death of another man outside a
bar.
   Robert Wallace, 21, initially indicted on a murder charge in the
death of Daniel Klagsbrun, 25, slumped in his seat when the verdict
was announced after 13 hours of deliberations over two days.
   State Supreme Court Justice Rena Uviller released Wallace on bail
until sentencing Feb. 2. Wallace faces up to four years in prison.
   Wallace was accused of picking a fight with Klagsbrun and his
five companions outside a bar on Jan. 24 after one member of the
group offended Wallace.
   When Klagsbrun told him no one wanted to fight, Wallace spun 360
degrees and delivered a booted kick to Klagsbrun's throat, knocking
him back onto the pavement, according to testimony. Klagsbrun died a
short time later.
   Wallace was arrested two weeks later in San Francisco.
   The judge threw out the murder charge Tuesday, leaving just the
first- and second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent
homicide charges.
   As the jury foreman announced the verdict, both the victim's
family and Wallace's family burst out crying and Wallace's mother,
Pauline, hugged her son.
   ``It's extremely disappointing,'' Herbert Klagsbrun, the victim's
father, said.

   The Grinch was pinched from a hotel display, giving
the storybook character a taste of his own medicine.
   The downtown Quality Inn has put up an eggnog reward for
information leading to the return of the lanky larcener.
   ``We're missing a 6-foot green Grinch. AWOL in Boston,'' Jeff
Hilary, manager of the downtown Quality Inn said Friday.
   No leads turned up Friday, although Hilary said an ice carver
would be bringing in an ice sculpture of the cold-hearted Grinch to
replace the missing statue.
   Police were aiding in the search for the statue, said department
spokesman Jim Jordan.
   ``We have a report of stolen property, a 6-foot papier-mache
statue from the famous Dr. Seuss children's story,'' he said. ``We
have no information as to its whereabouts.''
   Hilary said the theft was detected early Thursday after a party
in a hotel ballroom where the Grinch was on display.
   ``There can't be that many gangly green Grinches wandering around
Boston,'' Hilary said. ``He's quite tall _ got a Christmas hat on.''
   The Grinch was part of a Christmas display worth about $800,
Hilary said. Thieves left the sleigh on which the Grinch had perched.
   According to the children's story by Dr. Seuss, ``The Grinch That
Stole Christmas,'' the dour green character makes off with a town's
Christmas decorations and presents after becoming enraged by the
sounds of Christmas cheer. But the Grinch relents and returns the
booty to Whoville.
   Hilary said hotel staff hope the heist is the work of a prankster
who will decide to restore the decoration.
   ``We're offering a reward of a substantial amount of eggnog for
anybody with information leading to the reapprehension of our
friend,'' he said. ``I don't know what the insurance company's going
to say about it.''

   Singer Frank Sinatra says he feels like he's on
the right track when he gets to spend time playing with his 250
model trains.
   ``The noise of the trains running and whistling can get pretty
loud, but watching the trains just removes my head from thinking
about work,'' Ol' Blue Eyes said in this weekend's edition of USA
Weekend magazine.
   When Sinatra was an 11-year-old boy growing up in Hoboken, N.J.,
he desperately wanted a train set, ``but I didn't know how my family
could ever afford it,'' Sinatra said.
   ``One day, my mother pawned her fox fur piece to buy my first
train set, a windup engine and an oval track. I never forgot that.
It was probably the only decent thing she had to wear and I was old
enough to understand the sacrifice.''
   So, now, at his Rancho Mirage, Calif., home, Sinatra has an
18-by-30 train station with the 250 model traincars. Five trains can
run simultaneously on independent loops, running through Hoboken or
an Old West town and passing by a New Orleans riverboat with a
billboard announcing a sold-out Sinatra concert.

   Lord Nicholas Windsor, whose father the Duke of
Kent is a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, was arrested for possessing
marijuana but was released without charge after receiving a warning
from Scotland Yard.
   Windsor, 18, was arrested with a friend in London's St. James's
Park near Buckingham Palace on Wednesday night, Scotland Yard said
in a statement Friday.
   The two were taken to a nearby police station where officers
issued a caution _ a formal warning _ about possession of illegal
drugs before allowing them to leave.
   It said they were not charged because the amount of marijuana
involved was small. It did not specify the amount of the drug and
gave no other details.
   But a Scotland Yard spokeswoman, who declined to be named, denied
they were treated leniently simply because Windsor, who is 19th in
line of succession to the throne, is a member of the royal family.

   The 24-year-old prince said Friday the teen-agers were ``prey to
pimps and (drug) pushers'' and because of a shake-up in welfare
payments ``by accident, I'm sure, their plight is about to get
worse.''
   ``This blow is only one of many which can wreck a young life,''
Edward said in a speech during the presentation of an award to a

unemployment benefits for an estimated 50,000 people who do not

<HEAD>Many Who Sought Personalized Benefit Statement Have Not Mailed
Application</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Social Security Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy
says many of the millions of people who flooded her agency with
phone calls last summer for a new personalized benefit statement
have not yet taken the trouble to complete the application.
   ``More than 6 million people have asked us for the statement. But
only 35 percent of them have sent it back to us,'' Hardy told
reporters Friday. ``It's still hanging on their refrigerators.''
   The Social Security Administration had trouble fielding all the
phone calls requesting its Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate
Statement (PEBES) when it became available in August.
   But Hardy said the bottleneck on the phone lines has been cleared
and ``we're ready, willing and able to provide them now. I would
really like to have everybody have a PEBES in their stocking.''
   The toll-free number to call is 1-800-234-5772.
   Operators are on hand to answer the calls at various Social
Security centers from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time on weekdays. Those
who call after working hours or on weekends will get a recording
capable of taking messages.
   Once the form is mailed back, it takes the agency three weeks to
crank out the estimates of future monthly retirement benefits, as
well as how much a worker and family gets if he or she becomes
disabled or dies.
   The agency also provides a year-by-year list of workers' wages
and Social Security taxes.
   In other matters, Hardy said she and the Department of Health and
Human Services were unable to get included in President Reagan's
fiscal 1990 budget a proposal to eliminate a Social Security's
earnings test.
   The earnings test reduces benefits of beneficiaries under age 70
who earn more than certain amounts. The thresholds this year are
$8,400 for those ages 65-69 and $6,120 for those under 65; in 1989
they are $8,880 and $6,480 respectively.
   She also said, ``I'm hearing from seniors at town hall meetings
that they are not pleased about the (income tax) surtax that's
coming'' to pay for Medicare's new catastrophic insurance benefit.
   Hardy said she ``wouldn't be surprised'' if Congress took another
look at whether to levy the 15 percent tax surcharge on the elderly
to pay for the insurance, which starts in January.
   Hardy wants all 130 million American workers to request their
earnings records at least once every three years both to ensure
their wages were reported correctly, and to get a better idea of
what to expect from Social Security upon retirement.
   Hardy hopes that people armed with that information will save
more and rely less on the government for their retirement income.
   Currently, more than half the elderly rely on Social Security as
their main source of income. But the program was always intended
just to be part of retirement income, she said.

<HEAD>Panels Urges Restrictions On Alcohol Advertising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal panel is calling for restrictions on
alcohol advertising and higher state and federal excise taxes in an
effort to reduce drunken driving by discouraging alcohol consumption.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop accepted an inch-thick packet of
recommendations Friday at the close of a three-day workshop he
convened, and he vowed to use his high public profile to publicize
the report.
   While stopping short of urging an outright ban of beer, wine and
liquor advertising, the panel said such ads should not be allowed on
college campuses ``since a high proportion of audience reached is
under the legal drinking age.''
   Koop told the workshop participants that his office had little
money or power to implement policy, but promised to provide start-up
funds for a non-profit, private corporation to serve as a
clearinghouse for groups seeking ammunition to use in the war on
drunken driving.
   Koop said that, for his part, he intends to be an aggressive but
not shrill soldier.
   ``I intend to ignore those who would lynch or execute a first
offender in drunk driving just as I will ignore those who would say
it has not yet been proven that alcohol is responsible for impaired
driving,'' Koop told the workshop.
   ``I intend to pursue whatever leadership role I may have between
these two extremes as I have with other issues and to transmit to
that leadership whatever energy, enthusiasm and credibility I have
in this war against impaired driving.''
   The panel's other recommendations called for:
   _Elimination of alcohol advertising and promotion and sponsorship
of public events where the majority of the audience is under the
legal drinking age.
   _Elimination of advertising that portrays activities that are
combined with alcohol use.
   _Banning of sponsorship of athletic events by the alcohol
beverage industry.
   _Blocking the use of celebrities who have a strong appeal to
young people in alcohol advertising and promotion.
   _Requiring that the warning labels Congress recently voted to
require on alcoholic containers also be required to appear clearly
and conspicuously in all alcohol ads.
   No specific monetary figures were contained in the section on
taxes, but the panelist said excise tax rates at both the federal
and state level should be equalized among beer, wine and liquor and
indexed to rise automatically with inflation.
   The advertising section was most controversial, largely because
the National Association of Broadcasters and the advertising
industry had declined to participate in the workshop, claiming it
was stacked against advertisers' interests.
   ``In fact, the research the ad industry provided the panel
demonstrates that there is no existing evidence that links
advertising and alcohol abuse,'' said Howard Bell, president of the
American Advertising Federation in a statement Friday.
   NAB President Edward O. Fritts wrote Koop last month: ``At best,
this workshop is designed to politicize the emotional tragedy of
drunk driving. At worst, it is a total abuse of the policy-setting
process.''
   Koop, who had not responded publicly to that charge, lashed back
at the end of his remarks Friday.
   ``I wanted everyone to hear the NAB's point of view not only
because broadcasters are very influential, but because they also
have so much at stake in this issue,'' he said. ``Hence, they
certainly have the right to be here.''
   Koop said he felt the criticism of the workshop was unfair and
said he was ``taken aback'' by what he called Fritts' ``unfortunate
choice of words.''

<HEAD>President Says America No Longer The Dominant Global Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said in the last major foreign
policy speech of his presidency that America ``no longer enjoys
preponderant power'' in the world.
   As a result, Reagan said, his Oval Office successors and the
Congress must not treat each other as ``adversaries'' but must work
more cooperatively if the United States is to be successful in
pursuing its interests in the global arena.
   ``It is precisely where Congress and the president have worked
together, as in Afghanistan and Cambodia, or resolved differences,
as in Angola, the Persian Gulf and many aspects of U.S.-Soviet
relations, precisely there, (where) our policies have succeeded, and
we see progress,'' the president on Friday told students and faculty
at the University of Virginia, on the campus founded by Thomas
Jefferson.
   ``But where Congress and the president have engaged each other as
adversaries _ as over Central America _ U.S. policies have faltered
and our common purposes have not been achieved,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan said he thought that Congress in recent years had taken on
too great a role in making foreign policy. Instead of linking his
own support for the Contra rebels to the difficulties in Central
America, Reagan blamed Congress' ``on-again, off-again
indecisiveness on resisting Sandinista tyranny and aggression'' in
Nicaragua for leaving the area ``a region of continuing danger.''
   Reagan complained about the War Powers Resolution, which gives
Congress a veto power over the commitment of U.S. troops abroad
after a 60-day period.
   He lamented attempts by Congress to ``manage complex issues of
foreign policy by the blunt instrument of legislation, such as
unduly restrictive intelligence oversight, limits on arms transfers
and earmarking of 95 percent of our foreign assistance, denying a
president the ability to respond flexibly to rapidly changing
conditions.''
   In his speech, Reagan also lauded Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, saying ``let us credit him'' for his reforms. But Reagan
added that America must remain skeptical about the U.S.-Soviet
relationship because ``serious problems, fundamental differences
remain.''
   ``Yes, we welcome Mr. Gorbachev's recent announcement of a troop
reduction,'' Reagan said, ``but let us remember that the Soviet
preponderance in military power in Europe remains _ an asymmetry
that offends our Jeffersonian senses _ and endangers our future.''
   ``So we must keep our heads, and this means keeping our
skepticism,'' he said.
   He credited Gorbachev with taking ``some daring steps'' to bring
about reforms that Reagan said would have been unthinkable under
former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin, Nikita S. Khrushchev and Leonid
I. Brezhnev.
   The president said the superpowers are ``coming closer'' to
agreement on a Strategic Arms Reduction Talks treaty, saying that
``where the portions of the draft treaty disputed by one side or the
other are put in brackets, we are slowly seeing the brackets
disappear.''
   The president also credited America's ``strong and steadfast''
support of Israel's statehood for persuading the Palestine
Liberation Organization to moderate its views toward the Jewish
nation.
   ``That resolve has now paid off'' with the opening of a U.S.-PLO
dialogue aimed at advancing peace in the Middle East, Reagan said.
   Reagan's speech came in the wake of his decision to reverse a
13-year U.S. policy of refusing to have contact with the PLO.
   ``Where we are strong and steadfast, we succeed,'' he said. ``The
country stood firm for years, insisting that the PLO had to accept
Israel's right to exist ... and renounce terrorism.''
   During a brief question-and-answer session with students, Reagan
called the opening to Yasser Arafat's PLO ``a great step forward.''
But he said that peace will be achieved only ``when the principals
come together to negotiate.''
   White House officials have said Reagan plans a farewell address
to the nation sometime in January _ probably from the Oval Office.
But spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Friday that he did not know of any
other foreign policy addresses scheduled in the remaining 35 days of
Reagan's presidency.

   Three of Hollywood's holy relics have changed
hands.
   A piano played by Sam in ``Casablanca,'' the hat worn by the
Wicked Witch of the West in ``The Wizard of Oz'' and Clark Gable's
script for ``Gone With the Wind'' were all sold at auction Friday.
   The Japanese trading company C. Itoh & Co. outbid developer
Donald Trump to buy the piano for $154,000, on behalf of an
anonymous ``Casablanca'' fan in Japan.
   ``It's because many Japanese are fans of the old '40s movies,''
said a company representative, Mashahiro Kanaoka.
   Trump, who was in the audience bidding, went home without comment
immediately after the piano sold at Sotheby's auction house in
Manhattan.
   The green and beige upright piano, used in the flashback sequence
of the 1942-43 Warner Brothers classic, had a pre-sale estimate of
$75,000 to $100,000 by Sotheby's.
   Frankly, a dear price was paid for Gable's script from the 1939
film ``Gone With the Wind'' _ $77,000, bid by telephone by Detroit
disc jockey Dick Purtan. Sotheby's had listed an estimate of $3,000
to $4,000 for the leather-covered script with Gable's name embossed
in bold.
   The auction catalog said Gable gave the script to an MGM studios
secretary who was a ``close personal friend.''
   An anonymous private collector in Australia submitted the winning
bid of $33,000 for the witch's hat. The black pointed hat was all
that remained of the wicked witch when Dorothy accidentally melted
her with a bucket of water.
   Nine stemware glasses from Rick's Cafe Americain in
``Casablanca,'' estimated at $1,000 to $5,000, sold for $3,020. A
Masonite advertising board used at the movie's 1943 premiere,
estimated at $5,000 to $7,000, was sold for $22,000.
   The ``Casablanca'' piano was from the Paris flashback scene at Le
Belle Aurore Cafe, where Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman)
discuss love, marriage and the impending German occupation while Sam
(Dooley Wilson) plays ``As Time Goes By.''
   Later, Rick and Ilsa meet again at Rick's Cafe in Casablanca,
where Sam plays an encore on another piano.
   ``You played it for her. You can play it for me,'' Rick said. To
which Sam replied, ``But I don't think I can remember.''
   ``If she can stand it, I can. Play it!'' Rick commanded, in a
line that has since been widely misquoted as ``Play it again, Sam.''
   Many famous props, such as the ruby slippers from ``The Wizard of
Oz'' and the sled from ``Citizen Kane'' were made in multiples.
However, ``This piano from the Paris scene is truly unique in that
it was actually used throughout the entire Paris cafe sequence,''
the auction catalog said.
   The piano also was used in 1943 in a U.S. Savings Bond drive
featuring Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney and Lucille Ball.

<TEXT>
   The $516 million-per-plane pricetag for the B-2
stealth bomber makes it the most expensive aircraft ever built, but
Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge says whatever the
radar-evading plane costs, it's worth it.
   The stealth bomber, which resembles a huge, tailless manta ray,
is expected to make its first flight early next year but will not be
ready for wartime use until 1992 at the earliest, Aldridge said
Friday.
   Aldridge told a news conference the design, development and
construction of 132 planes was expected to cost $68.1 billion by the
time production ends in mid-1995.
   Expressed in terms of the original estimate, the price tag has
grown from $36.6 billion to $42.5 billion in fiscal 1981 dollars _
an increase of about 16 percent, Aldridge said. Those figures do not
reflect cost increases caused by inflation since 1981 or that
projected in future years.
   Congress must authorize and appropriate money for production, and
the figures assume it will do so at the pace the Air Force proposes.
Aldridge said a stretchout of production would boost the per-plane
cost by 20 percent or more.
   The Air Force gave the public its first glimpse of the aircraft
at a ceremony in Palmdale, Calif., last month.
   About one-third of the total cost of the long-range bomber is
being spent on research and development. The actual production cost
amounts to $305 million per plane, Aldridge said.
   ``Whatever it costs, it's worth it,'' Aldridge said. ``How much
is deterrence worth?
   ``This thing is a significant contributor to the strategic
deterrence of our country. The Soviets know it. They know the
capabilities this aircraft can provide.''
   Aldridge, reviewing the results of a long-running internal review
of the B-2, said the Air Force had decided to slow production of the
bomber during the early years of the program and to accelerate
production at the end.
   He refused to offer specific numbers, but he said the
acceleration at the end of the program would be such that production
of all 132 of the planes would be completed a year early, in
mid-1995.
   The latest cost projection includes estimated savings of about $3
billion, the secretary continued, thanks to the changes in
production and a decision to purchase more than 100 of the planes
under a single, multiyear contract.
   Few of the planes will be built while the bomber is undergoing
flight testing in the early years, Aldridge explained. Once the
flight testing is completed and the design frozen, a multiyear
contract can be negotiated to achieve the most economical rate of
production, he added.
   Aldridge said a large portion of the cost increase _ about $1
billion in fiscal 1981 dollars _ ``results from a major redesign
effort in 1983.''
   The Air Force secretary said the redesign was ordered because the
stealth bomber originally was meant only to fly at high altitude.
The Air Force decided in 1983 that the plane should be able to fly
at low altitude as well and that forced a redesign of its flying
wing shape, he said.
   The B-2 gets its stealth name from the claim that it will be
extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar due to the extensive
use of exotic composite materials, its lack of sharp surface angles,
and a cross-section that offers a very small profile to radar. It is
built mainly by Northrop Corp.
   At $516 million per copy, the B-2 would eclipse the new B-1B
bomber, which cost about $280 million per copy, as the most
expensive plane in the Air Force inventory. The newest model of the
largest U.S. commercial aircraft, the Boeing 747, sells for roughly
$125 million.
   Aldridge, appearing before Pentagon reporters on his last day in
office before joining the McDonnell Douglas Corp., said the B-2
would fly for the first time ``as soon as it's ready,'' probably
early next year.
   He said the first operational B-2 would be delivered to Whiteman
Air Force Base, Mo., in mid-1991 and that the Air Force probably
will select three additional bases to house them.
   It probably will be at least 1992 before the plane is certified
for ``initial operational capability,'' meaning it could fly in a
war, Aldridge said.

<HEAD>US, Soviets End Round of Talks on Nuclear Testing Without Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says U.S. and Soviet
negotiators have reached virtual agreement on ways to measure some
underground nuclear tests, but a final agreement still eludes the
two sides.
   The result is further postponement of possible Senate
ratification of two nuclear test treaties completed more than a
decade ago. The treaties would limit underground blasts to 150
kilotons.
   President Reagan has said he would submit the 1974 accord on
weapons tests and the 1976 agreement on tests for civilian purposes
only if agreement were reached on air-tight procedures to guard
against cheating.
   Reagan has accused the Soviets of carrying out tests that
probably exceeded the permissible ceiling. Some American experts
doubted the Soviets had violated the treaties, which both sides are
supposed to be observing even though the Senate has not approved the
pacts.

<HEAD>Court Upholds NRC On Importing Nuclear Fuel From South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear plant fuel may still be imported to the
United States from South Africa despite anti-apartheid sanctions
enacted by Congress, a federal appeals court has ruled.
   A split three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here ruled that the petitioners lacked legal standing to challenge
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's decision to allow continued
importation of uranium hexafluoride from South Africa.
   The NRC's 1987 decision was challenged by seven members of
Congress, four private organizations and two individuals, including
an unemployed uranium miner and an anti-apartheid activist.
   The petitioners had contended that the NRC failed to enforce the
anti-apartheid sanctions passed by Congress in 1986 that forbid
continued importation of South African uranium and uranium oxide.
   The NRC had decided that the sanction law did not ban uranium
hexafluoride, a gas that is used to power nuclear reactors.

   A theme park dubbed the Communist

Austrian-Hungarian venture, the state MTI news agency reported.
   The Fanni-World company in Vienna and the Hungarian government
have signed a ``declaration of intention'' in Budapest whereby the
Austrian side would contribute $50 million or 70 percent of the
amount needed for the venture, MTI said Friday.
   The Hungarian side is to pay another $20 million for the park,
the report said. It said organizers planned to scour the Asian
market for other capital needed to complete the project, but it did
not say how much more will be needed.
   The park is scheduled for completion by 1993.
   The Marxist-oriented park will be ``an educational, as well as
recreational complex'' with the equipment to be imported from U.S.,
French, Japanese and Hong Kong firms, MTI said, without elaborating.
   The park is planned eight miles from downtown Budapest.
   In recent years, about 12 million tourists visited Hungary
anually and organizers expect the facility to be toured by 30,000
people a day when completed, the news agency said.

<HEAD>Israelis Accuse Radicals Of Trying To Undermine U.S.-PLO Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin accused radical
Palestinians of trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO talks by staging
violent riots in the occupied territories that left at least four
Arabs dead.
   Rabin and other officials refrained from direct comment Friday
after U.S. and PLO delegates held their first face-to-face meeting
in Tunisia, but they reiterated their opposition to Washington's
decision to speak to the organization.
   Rabin said the U.S. decision was ``a grave mistake.''
   ``You abandoned an important principle in the general American
policy, the principle of opposing terrorism and waging war against
it,'' he said on Israel Television.
   Rabin spoke after the 90-minute meeting between U.S. Ambassador
Robert H. Pelletreau and a four-man PLO delegation in Carthage, a
suburb of the capital city Tunis.
   The defense minister said Israel should demand the United States
make Arafat prove he was sincere when he said last week that he
renounced all forms of terrorism.
   ``Our first demand from the United States should be, put Arafat
to a test, demand from him to come out and tell all the Palestinians
in his voice, in Arabic, to stop terror,'' Rabin said.
   Despite his opposition to the American-PLO dialogue, Rabin said
it could lead to a decrease in violence.
   ``It was clear to us that a large part of the (Palestinian)
population will see the events of the week as their achievement, and
will try to moderate their role in violence,'' he said.
   ``But it was also clear that radical elements who oppose these
moves ... will try to heat up the area,'' Rabin told Israel
Television.
   Rabin, the No. 2 man in the left-leaning Labor Party headed by
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, echoed his party leader in saying
Israel should counter the U.S. initiative with its own peace plan,
``even if it would not be accepted in the foreseeable future.''
   He spoke on one of the bloodiest days of the Palestinian
rebellion against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In Friday's clashes, Israeli soldiers shot to death four Arabs,
and Arab doctors said as many as 32 were wounded.It was among the
worst violence since April 16, when Israeli troops killed 14
Palestinians during riots protesting the assassination in Tunisia of
Khalil Wazir, the PLO military commander.
   The latest deaths brought to 328 the number of Palestinians
killed in the yearlong revolt. Thirteen Israelis have also died
during the unrest.
   Meanwhile, aides to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the
rightist Likud bloc leader recognized the need for a credible
Israeli peace plan.
   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, said the prime minister was
considering ``new moves.''
   ``Be sure that Mr. Shamir is preparing a peace move which will
surprise everyone,'' Pazner said, refusing to disclose details.
   Newspaper reports said the plan was to unilaterally establish a
limited self-rule for Palestinians, as envisioned in the Camp David
accords mediated by the United States in 1978.
   Friday's confrontations in the occupied lands were inspired by
the death Thursday night of a teen-ager from a gunshot wound
suffered Nov. 25, according to doctors at Anglican Hospital in
Nablus.
   Army officials said the riots appeared premeditated and began in
numerous areas even before the teen-ager's funeral in the West Bank
city of Nablus.
   West Bank commander Brig. Gen. Gabi Ofir said the high casualty
toll ``resulted from the fact that we had to disperse riots in many
locations.''
   Doctors said 20 people were wounded in Nablus, four of them
critically. The army confirmed four killed and nine wounded.
   Soldiers wounded five Palestinians in villages near Tulkarem in
the West Bank, including a 9-year-old boy shot in the neck, Arab
witnesses said.
   Doctors said seven young men were wounded at the Rafah, Nuseirat
and Jabaliya refugee camps in the Gaza Strip.

   The former Portuguese colony of East
Timor will be opened to outsiders by Christmas, officials said.
   East Timor has been closed to foreigners since Indonesian troops
invaded the small island territory in 1975 following an outbreak of
strife between rival nationalist movements and the end of Portuguese
rule.
   International humanitarian organizations estimate as many as
100,000 people, one-sixth of East Timor's population, may have died
in the hostilities and from the disease and famine that ensued.
   Indonesia subsequently annexed East Timor as its 27th province.
Since then, people traveling to and from the territory have needed
certificates issued by security authorities.
   The home affairs minister, Rudini, said Friday that the security
situation in the area had improved, allowing a relaxation of
controls.
   International groups have called repeatedly on Jakarta to allow
humanitarian organizations into East Timor to observe the human
rights situation.
   The U.N. General Assembly also has called on Indonesia to
withdraw and allow residents of East Timor to determine their own
future. Nationalist guerrillas on the island continue to resist
Indonesian rule.

   Students cowered and cried ``Jesus
save us! God save us!'' as a 16-year-old boy opened fire in their
Bible class after he killed one teacher and wounded another, police
said.
   The boy fired two shots in the classroom but did not hit anyone
before his MAC-10 commando-style machine pistol jammed and he was
subdued by a teacher and students at the Atlantic Shores Christian
School, authorities said.
   ``Once you see what went on in there, it's a miracle that we
didn't have more people killed,'' Police Chief Charles R. Wall said
Friday.
   Police spokesman Lewis Thurston said the 10th-grader was charged
with first-degree murder, malicious assault, four counts of
attempted murder, six counts of using a gun to commit a crime and
three counts of discharging a firearm in an occupied building. He
was in custody today.
   The boy's name was not made public because he is a juvenile, but
relatives and neighbors identified him as Nicholas Elliott.
   Mark Shallenberg, a 12-year-old seventh-grader, said the suspect
was a friend.
   ``He was always real nice and happy. He was never angry,''
Shallenberg said. ``This morning I noticed when I said `Hi' to him
he seemed kind of distant, like he was thinking of something.
   ``I just didn't know. I didn't know he was the kind of kid who
would do something like that. He wasn't one of the most popular kids
around school but, yeah, he had friends.''
   Thurston said police had no motive for the shootings.
   The dead teacher was identified as Karen H. Farley, a 41-year-old
mother of two. When she failed to show up for an emergency meeting
of teachers about an hour after the shootings, authorities searched
for her. They found her body behind a classroom door.
   Wounded was Samuel M. Marino, 37, who was in serious condition
with a gunshot wound to the shoulder at Sentara Norfolk General
Hospital.
   Police found what appeared to be three Molotov cocktails in the
boy's locker and confiscated the gun and an unknown number of spent
shell casings.
   The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and police were
trying to trace the weapon's origin. Police said the boy apparently
carried the gun in his knapsack and arrived by bus. It was not known
if he attended any classes before the shootings began shortly before
10:30 a.m. Friday.
   The school, which is affiliated with the fundamentalist Atlantic
Shores Baptist Church, has 500 students in kindergarten through 12th
grade. The shootings occurred in a complex of four portable
classrooms outside the main building.
   It was unknown when Ms. Farley was shot, but witnesses said after
the boy had chased one instructor through the courtyard and shot
Marino, he ran toward a classroom of Bible students.
   The Bible teacher, Hutch Matson, and a student, James C. Wright,
17, locked the door just as the youth turned and climbed the stairs.
Realizing the door was locked, the youth shot out the window and
burst in.
   The boy aimed and fired two shots and missed, as fearful students
cowered on the floor and cried out, ``Jesus save us! God save us!''
   Then, the gun jammed.
   Matson raced toward the student and tackled him, Wright said. The
gun fired once more.
   ``At that time, as soon as I saw Hutch get a little control over
him, some guys and I went over and got the gun from him,'' said
Wright. ``The locking up of the gun _ that was just a miracle.''
   About 40 students witnessed the shootings. The chaos that
followed saw students and teachers crying and anxious parents
arriving to take their children home.
   Kathy Pollak, whose daughter was in Ms. Farley's geometry class,
said other parents were shocked that the incident took place at a
Christian school, but added: ``Not everyone who goes to a Christian
school is close to the Lord, saved or perfect. What can I say?''
   The Rev. Donald E. Taylor, pastor of the Greater Mount Zion
Baptist Church, said he talked with Elliot's mother, Estelle.
   ``You could tell she was quite distraught,'' Taylor said.

   Former strongman Gen. Muhammadu Buhari has
been released from prison, three years after he was toppled by a
coup, the military government announced.
   Duro Onabule, spokesman for the Armed Forces Ruling Council, said
Friday that Maj. Gen. Tunde Idiagbon, No. 2 man in the Buhari

   The state Daily Times newspaper said Buhari was seen Thursday in
his hometown, one day after his mother died at age 106 in a village

   The Daily Times said Buhari was greeted by his family and
hundreds of villagers who treked to his country home to catch a
glimpse of the former leader.
   Officials of the Armed Forces Ruling Council had earlier
indicated Buhari would be freed.
   Buhari overthrew the civilian government President Shehu Shagari
on Dec. 31, 1983. Buhari himself was overthrown on Aug. 27, 1985,
after a 20-month authoritarian rule that included the repression of
journalists, union and student leaders and professional groups.
   President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida has promised to return the
country to civilian rule by 1991.

<HEAD>Cardinal Says Foes of Church Closings Promote `Plantation
Mentality'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Edmund Szoka said a plan to close or
merge 43 inner-city Roman Catholic parishes is needed to erase a
``plantation mentality'' in which white pastors and lay people run
churches attended mostly by blacks.
   The plan, which would entail the largest church closing in U.S.
Roman Catholic history, has angered members of the city's 112
Catholic churches since it was announced in September.
   The cardinal strongly defended the plan in a just-released
transcript of a Dec. 3 meeting of leaders of the Archdiocese of
Detroit, which covers southeastern Michigan and has 1.5 million
members under Szoka's leadership.
   ``I know what I am doing and I believe that I am following God's
will,'' Szoka said in the transcript. ``They can lambaste me all
they want, but my purpose is to fulfill the gospel, to make it
possible for that gospel to be preached effectively to the people
who are here now.''
   Opponents of the closings, who include both black and white
parishioners, picketed outside Szoka's home Friday.
   The number of Catholics in Detroit has decreased drastically as
whites have fled the nation's sixth-largest city for the suburbs. In
1976, more than 100,000 Catholic households were in Detroit, as
against fewer than 50,000 now.
   About two-thirds of the city's 1.1 million residents are black,
and the vast majority of church-affiliated blacks are Protestant.
   Szoka said the plan, which targets parishes that are losing
membership and are not considered economically viable, will help
deal with the complaints of black Catholics that predominantly black
parishes are led by whites.
   ``Black Catholics tell me that they no longer want the plantation
mentality,'' the cardinal said. ``They don't want this white pastor
saying, `Now you leave my black people alone, I'll take care of
their needs.'
   ``We have the anomaly today of parishes which are predominantly
black with a white pastor and a totally white staff. Why shouldn't
these black people have the leadership in that parish? Why should we
be importing people from the suburbs, white people, to come in here
and continue to run these parishes?''
   Surveys found that 95 percent of the city's churches had strong
black membership, but the operational structure was white, Auxiliary
Bishop Patrick Cooney said Friday.
   ``We're not denying the value of what any white priest, sisters
or brothers have done in the city. But sometime we have to stop and
see what's best for the church and say, hey, it's time for black
Catholic leaders to be seen and heard,'' Cooney said.
   But the Rev. Norman Thomas, pastor of Sacred Heart Church in
Detroit and leader of the Detroit Catholic Pastoral Alliance, a
group fighting the plan, said the assessment was distorted.
   ``We run our own parish here,'' said Thomas, a white pastor,
whose church staff members are mostly black residents of Detroit.
``I think (Szoka) wants to do the right thing but he's being fed
some very bad information and really is speaking with no experience
on these things.''
   Cooney, who has spent five years overseeing the study of urban
churches, said he will deliver recommendations from appeal hearings
on the closings to Szoka on Monday. The cardinal is expected to make
a final decision during the first week in January.
   The archdiocese also released a letter of resignation Friday from
a member of the Implementation Committee, one of two panels formed
to help Cooney judge the viability of urban churches.
   Sister Mary Kelly said in the letter that she believes the board
will recommend closing churches that proved they were healthy in
appeal hearings.
   ``Many parishes slated to close have in fact demonstrated
viability in ways that could be models for other parishes,'' she
said.
   Under the plan, 42 churches in Detroit and one in nearby River
Rouge would close or merge with other parishes. Archdiocese

<HEAD>Judge Sentences `Drug Pusher' Psychiatrist To Five Years</HEAD>

   A psychiatrist who illegally prescribed drugs
to addicts has been sentenced to five years in prison by a judge who
called him nothing but a ``highly educated, well-placed drug
pusher.''
   Dr. Edward M. Keelan also was fined $25,000 on Friday, given a
concurrent five-year prison sentence for two counts of witness
tampering and ordered to serve five years' probation after his
release from prison.
   ``The bottom line is he's just another drug pusher _ in a
tailored suit,'' said Superior Court Judge Leander Gray.
   In defense of his drug-prescription practices, Keelan submitted a
2{-page poem entitled ``Maverick in the State.'' In it, he expressed
an anti-tax philosophy and claimed the right to treat patients
without state interference.
   He also recited part of another poem in which he said voices,
including that of Lucifer, encouraged him to try to influence a
witness's testimony.
   Keelan, 58, was arrested in December 1987 after an undercover
agent from the state Department of Consumer Protection received
prescriptions for narcotics from the doctor at his Milford office
without any examination.
   In October, Keelan entered a guilty plea to six counts of
illegally prescribing narcotics, and on Friday he submitted guilty
pleas to the witness tampering charges.
   Assistant State's Attorney Francis J. McQuade, who prosecuted the
case, said ``the amount of damage he has done is mind-boggling when
compared to what a street dealer could even think of doing.''
   According to prosecutors, Keelan would see a stream of drug
addicts and abusers at his office every Saturday, charging each
visitor $20 to $30 apiece for writing a narcotics prescription. The
visits would typically last only about 10 minutes.
   ``He's a plague on society. He is a plague on the poor,'' McQuade
said.
   Undercover agents who watched his office said Keelan's visitors
included ``every junkie we ever saw or heard of and a lot that we
didn't,'' McQuade said.
   Keelan's attorney, Raymond W. Ganim, told the judge the doctor
deserved leniency because he is a manic depressive whose judgment
was impaired by his failure to take proper dosages of his medication.
   ``The man needs help. He doesn't need incarceration,'' Ganim said.
   But the judge said Keelan's mental illness could not be used as
an excuse for his behavior. In spite of his illness, the judge
noted, Keelan had held a number of posts in the medical field in
recent years.
   Gray said Keelan was nothing more than a ``highly educated,
well-placed drug pusher'' who ``did it for the money.''
   Psychiatrist Robert Miller testified at the sentencing hearing
that Keelan's illness would not prevent him from knowing the
difference between right and wrong.
   Keelan's attorney said the doctor's poem about being a maverick
showed his judgment was impaired, ``because if there is ever a time
he should be on his knees, this is it.''
   The prosecution cited the poem as evidence Keelan ``puts himself
above the law.''
   But the judge said he was not going to be swayed either way by
the poem, saying, ``I'm not a poetry critic.''
   The state Medical Examining Board ordered the revocation of
Keelan's license last August.

   The Soviet Union conducted an underground nuclear
test today at government grounds near Semipalatinsk in Central Asia,
the official news agency Tass said.
   It said the 7:18 a.m. test (11:18 p.m. EST Friday) had a yield of
20 to 150 kilotons and was conducted ``with a view to upgrading
military technology.''
   Tass added, ``The radiation situation in the testing area and
beyond the test site is normal.''
   No other details were provided.

<HEAD>Grumman Corp. Announces Massive Layoffs To Begin In January</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BETHPAGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cancellation of a Navy bomber project
has prompted the Grumman Corp. to eliminate 3,100 jobs, but two
congressmen whose region will be most affected promise to fight the
government decision.
   The company announced the layoffs Friday in the wake of the
Navy's decision to scrap the A-6G bomber in the 1990 budget, said
Grumman spokesman Bob Harwood.
   ``This is quite a parting shot from the Reagan administration, an
administration that says it is committed to a strong defense,'' said
Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y.
   Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., called the Navy's decision
shortsighted.
   Both men vowed to fight to reverse the decision or to get
additional work for Grumman to avoid further cuts.
   Of the 3,100 jobs, 2,500 are from the company's operations on New
York's Long Island. The remaining 600 will be in Florida, Georgia
and Maryland.
   ``Our whole industry is facing flat or declining budgets,'' said
Grumman Chairman John O'Brien.
   A special edition of the company newspaper Friday morning carried
word of the layoffs, which begin next month.
   ``We know it is unfair to tell them at Christmas but it would be
unfair not to let them know what may be coming,'' said Harwood.
   The A-6G would have incorporated advanced digital electronics,
satellite navigation capability and a more powerful engine.
   Grumman has been building the A-6 since the early 1960s,
upgrading it several times over the years. The A-6G, an upgraded
version of the bomber, would have generated 1,000 new engineering
positions and brought in $250 million annually.
   In the past two years Grumman has been bumped from three major
military aircraft contracts. A contract to produce the Navy's
Advanced Tactical Aircraft, the replacement for the A-6, was awarded
to McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics in 1987, and the company
also lost out in the bidding for the Air Force's Advanced Tactical
Fighter.
   Grumman was at its peak in the late 1960s when it was building
lunar modules and employed 40,000 workers. The company now employs
32,000 workers.
   About 1,800 of the Long Island layoffs will occur in January, and
the rest will come by the end of 1989. Grumman had announced layoffs
in January 1987 and last March.

<HEAD>Carmel Highway 1 Bypass Voted By Coastal Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARMEL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A traffic gridlock at picturesque Carmel
along Highway 1 will be history if the California Coastal Commission
gets its way.
   The panel has given preliminary approval to a $25 million bypass
through a prized forest of old pines and oaks.
   Other agencies that would have to approve the bypass include the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the state Department of Fish
and Game, the Army Corps of Engineers, and Monterey County planners.
   The 11-0 vote Thursday has state highway engineers hoping they
can ease a bottleneck on the state's 1,000-mile coastal Highway 1
that results from traffic turning into Carmel's Ocean Avenue. The
traffic can stretch as far as five miles without moving.
   ``Carmel will never be the same after the first tree falls'' in
Hatton Canyon, warned Sally McPhail, a resident of the often
tourist-choked seaside town where actor Clint Eastwood served as
mayor.
   The town nestles close to the Pacific, 120 miles south of San
Francisco and just south of the Pebble Beach Golf Course. It is
populated by the wealthy and a colony of artists and writers.
   Called the Hatton Canyon freeway project, the four-mile Monterey
Peninsula bypass would run inland from Highway 1, on the north edge
of Carmel, through large virgin stands of Monterey pines and native
live oaks, across the mouth of Carmel Valley to the east, then back
to Highway 1 on the south edge of town.
   During the three-hour meeting, commissioners heard nearly 40
witnesses, most of them opposed to the project.
   In proxy statements, Monterey Peninsula legislators approved the
project. And Monterey County Supervisor Sam Karras told the
commission the bypass was ``crucially needed ... if we don't get on
with the project, there will be severe safety consequences.''
   One prominent exception to the nearly solid governmental support
for the Hatton Canyon project was Carmel Mayor Jean Grace. She said
there were strong objections to a ``Los Angeles-style interchange''
she said would be built at the north end of the bypass.
   ``This roadway should lie gentle on the land,'' she said, echoing
a sentiment expressed in a letter by her predecessor, Eastwood.
   The issue of a Highway 1 traffic relief dates back to the 1950s.

<HEAD>Governors, Energy Department Lay Groundwork For Solving Nuclear
Waste Impasse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department should be able to
meet conditions set by three governors for resolving a deadlock over
the storage of radioactive waste from nuclear weapons plants, a
department official said.
   The governors of Idaho, Colorado and New Mexico emerged from a
private meeting Friday with pledges of cooperation from Deputy
Energy Secretary Joseph Salgado.
   ``I think we've laid a solid groundwork for progress. We've put a
process in place. ... I believe it will bear fruit,'' Salgado said.
   But the governors said they would continue to pressure the
government to make sure the Energy Department honors its promise to
hasten the opening of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a prototype
storage facility under construction near Carlsbad, N.M.
   ``We stand here today to say there is no way we can guarantee
anything. There are uncertainties in the world, but I think we can
bridge that,'' said Colorado Gov. Roy Romer following the three-hour
meeting.
   The officials announced progress toward resolving the most
immediate problem, triggered when Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus closed his
state's borders to waste shipments in October to try to force the
Energy Department into action.
   Andrus said he would reconsider his decision if the Energy
Department speeded up the New Mexico plant's opening. His decision
is expected next month.
   Andrus said he decided to reconsider after being told in a
classified briefing that his ban on waste shipments into Idaho could
harm national security by forcing closure of the Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant near Denver.
   Since Andrus' order, the material has been piling up at Rocky
Flats, which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads.
   Romer has said he would close the plant when its temporary
storage capacity is filled. That should occur between March and May.
   After the meeting, however, Romer said he doesn't anticipate
closing the facility, although ``I cannot work with additional
storage in a metropolitan area of 1.5 million people.''
   Waste is being stored temporarily at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory in eastern Idaho until the New Mexico plant
opens, which Salgado said probably won't be until November or
December 1989.
   The plant, originally scheduled to open last fall, will store
wastes, including equipment and clothing that has been contaminated
during the weapons-making process, in salt deposits more than 2,000
feet underground.
   Andrus said that before he allows shipments to the Idaho plant to
resume, the Energy Department must also keep its pledge to introduce
legislation and begin administrative procedures for a land swap with
the Interior Department that must be completed before the pilot
plant can open.
   The department also must prepare plans to remove the more than 4
million cubic feet of radioactive waste already stored in Idaho.
   ``I said I wouldn't accept that old statement of `trust me.' I
said, `show me,''' said Andrus. ``I said, `If you're sincere, come
back and prove it to me in January and we'll reconsider.'''
   Salgado said the department would appoint a task force to look
for other temporary waste storage sites in case Andrus refuses to
lift his ban.
   But he expressed confidence that the necessary conditions could
be met to continue operations at Rocky Flats and move forward with
the opening of the pilot plant.
   One of the biggest stumbling blocks has been Congress' failure to
pass a bill to transfer several thousand acres of land around the
New Mexico plant from Interior Department control to the Energy
Department.
   The opening also has been delayed because of lapses in
engineering assessments and questions about water leakage at the
site.
   Salgado said the department will have a bill introduced when
Congress convenes in January. The department also will start
administrative procedures for the exchange should Congress move too
slowly, he said.
   ``Clearly, I think the DOE is trying to turn up the heat,'' New
Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers said at a news conference in Santa Fe,
N.M., upon his return from Utah.

<HEAD>More Found Alive In Quake Ruins, Search Goes On</HEAD>

   Rescuers found 21 people alive in Spitak
and Leninakan more than a week after they were buried in an
earthquake, and officials said the discovery persuaded them to
extend the search for survivors.
   An Armenian official told a Politburo commission overseeing
rescue operations that of the 135 people pulled from ruins, 21 were
saved. His report was shown on Soviet television Friday night.
   ``In Leninakan 110 were pulled out, and 20 were alive. In Spitak,
only one was alive,'' said the official, who was not identified. He
said the survivors were found Thursday.
   The discovery of one person still alive in Spitak spurred
searchers there to continue looking for another 10 days, said the
official. It was not clear how large an area would be included in
the continued search.
   On Thursday, a Communist Party official from the city said crews
would begin Sunday to raze what remained of the city. An estimated
15,000 of Spitak's 25,000 residents died in the Dec. 7 quake.
   Spitak and Leninakan were two of the cities hit hardest in the
quake, which killed an estimated 55,000 people and left 500,000
homeless in the Armenian republic.
   Tanks and armored personnel carriers sealed off Spitak on Friday.
At least 10 bulldozers were clearing away rubble, and trucks filled
with debris were leaving the city.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told a Politburo committee meeting
that some work was going slowly because relatives were lying in
front of bulldozers to prevent them from moving in until their
relatives' bodies were recovered.
   George Reid, a spokesman for the League of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies, told reporters in Yerevan that 22,312 dead had
been recovered by Friday, 537 more than Thursday.
   He said the Red Cross was bringing in 5,000 insulated winter
tents and that Soviet officials were hoping to bring in 5,000 mobile
homes to shelter men in Spitak who will work on reconstructing the
city.
   The head of the Soviet Red Cross also said Friday that Soviet
doctors can handle the medical treatment of Armenian earthquake
victims and do not need further international help.
   ``We can accept individuals (from abroad) to show them what has
been done, but we don't need medical assistance in the direct
sense,'' said Dmitri Venidiktov, chairman of the Soviet Red Cross
and former deputy health minister. He told a news conference in
Yerevan that medical teams had come from throughout the Soviet Union
since the earthquake.
   Several foreign doctors have complained privately that their
Soviet colleagues were not allowing them to treat patients with the
millions of dollars worth of sophisticated medical equipment brought
to the Soviet Union to handle the disaster.
   Ryzhkov praised the work of the foreign teams and criticized the
Foreign Ministry for providing inadequate assistance to the rescue
groups from abroad.
   In Moscow, an Armenian government representative, Eduard
Aikazyan, said each survivor would receive 500 rubles, or $833, and
that families would get 2,000 rubles, or $3,333, in addition to the
amount allotted individuals.
   The Soviet government frequently makes cash payments from the
central budget to victims of accidents and disaster.
   Help continued to be offered from abroad.
   In Budapest, the official Hungarian news agency MTI said the
Hungarian-Armenian Friendship Circle plans to take in children
orphaned in the earthquake.
   The brief report gave no indication of how many children would be
affected or when or how they would be taken to Hungary.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry said today Japan will send a team
of experts to Armenia to assist in reconstruction efforts following
a request from Soviet authorities.
   ``The focus of the rescue has shifted from life-saving efforts to
reconstruction,'' the ministry said in a statement. ``We hope the
team's research and analysis based on our country's expertise on
earthquake studies and seismology can contribute to the
reconstruction of the area.''

   The glow from an oil lamp illuminated
the faces of the Armenian villagers who came in from the snow to
visit the mayor in the plastic hut he and his family have lived in
since the Dec. 7 earthquake.
   The mayor, Napoleon Megerditchyan, who was pinned under a block
of stone for several hours until his son rescued him, reassured the
men of the village that their mountainside homes would be rebuilt
within two years.
   ``Gorbachev said he will do something, and he will,''
Megerditchyan said, referring to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who toured the disaster area last week.
   In the meantime, authorities are faced with finding winter
shelter for the estimated 500,000 survivors of one of the century's
worst quakes.
   The one-room corrugated shack, thrown up immediately after the
earthquake with supplies from the Red Cross, is cool already, and
will offer scant protection when temperatures drop further this
winter.
   Throughout the region, Armenians are preparing to endure the
approaching Soviet winter and recover from the shock of an
earthquake that killed at least 55,000 people.
   In Lusakhpyur, about 600 of the 1,000 residents already have left
seeking warmth in the homes of friends and relatives who survived
the quake. Seventy villagers were killed, including 50 children
crushed in a grade school corridor as they ran from collapsing
classrooms.
   Ice-covered mountain roads connecting northwestern Armenian
villages were bumper to bumper Thursday with cars, buses and trucks,
listing under the weight of refugees and their few belongings.
   Soviet military trucks with supplies of bread, milk, meat, heavy
coats and boots struggled through the traffic to deliver supplies to
the needy. People generally did not appear hungry or in need of warm
clothes, although some complained the emergency rations weren't
being distributed fairly.
   ``They select those they want to give to, and there is a
hierarchy,'' said Asat Petzosyan of Spitak, a city of about 25,000
almost wiped out by the quake. Officials say about 15,000 died in
Spitak.
   ``I need somewhere to sleep,'' Petzosyan said, rubbing hands
scarred from digging through the rubble searching for family and
friends. ``All I have been given is this coat.''
   Petzosyan and his neighbors have gathered pieces of broken
furniture and torn mattresses to create living rooms without walls
around outdoor bonfires, their only protection against the icy wind.
   Down the street, an elderly man stood motionless, surrounded by
the roar of bulldozers, staring into a heap of rubble two-stories
high. Tears ran down his unshaven cheeks.
   ``My granddaughter is in there,'' he said faintly. ``She is four.
I'm waiting for her.''
   But a happy ending is unlikely. Soviet authorities, fearing the
spread of disease from decaying bodies, began razing Spitak on
Friday.
   Later, workers rescued 21 people from the ruins in Spitak and
Leninakan, prompting authorities to extend their search for possible
survivors.
   George Reid, a spokesman for the League of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies, said the greatest challenge now is providing
shelter for those who remain. ``It is a terrible dilemma of
conflicting needs _ the need for sanitation and the feelings of
relatives,'' he said.
   ``Officials say they will evacuate 70,000 people, but that leaves
430,000 without homes,'' Reid said. ``Where do you put 430,000
people for the winter?''
   The Red Cross is bringing in 5,000 winter tents like those
already delivered by the Norwegian army.
   And Soviet authorities are hoping to bring in by rail thousands
of yurts, versions of the circular tents used for centuries on the
frigid steppes of Central Asia. Soviet soldiers are working beside
civilian crews to quickly repair the rail lines just outside Spitak.
   Soviet officials also hope to bring in thousands of mobile homes
for the local men who will be rebuilding their town.
   Azen Akopyan, a worker at an elevator factory, will stay in the
mobile home camp near Spitak. His wife, Nina, will join her children
next week at a temporary shelter set up by his trade union to house
survivors.
   ``I don't want to leave until Azen is in a warm place, but I wish
they would hurry,'' said Mrs. Akopyan, one of the few women in town
who did not lose a member of her immediate family. ``When they
rebuild Spitak, I guess I'll be back. But really, after all this, I
am so afraid of the mountains.''

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lear Jet flying from Tennessee to
Texas mysteriously overflew its destination and crashed in rugged
mountains of northern Mexico with two people aboard, officials said.
   Police spokesman Fernando Campos of Torreon said the search for
the plane was called off Friday because of darkness and rough
terrain and would resume today, with the help of a farmer who
reported seeing the downed plane and two bodies.
   The jet, which left Memphis, Tenn., at about 5 a.m. Friday,
crashed two or three hours later in a mountainous region 100 miles
northwest of Monterrey, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration and the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.
   The plane had a flight plan for Addison Airport in the Texas
suburb north of Dallas, said Stephen Telkins, embassy press attache.
   An F-16 and another plane tried to intercept and contact the
jet's pilot after the plane overshot its destination, but the pilot
did not respond, the FAA said.
   Araceli Suarez, a police spokeswoman in Monclova, 120 miles
outside Monterrey, said authorities reported a small plane was seen
early Friday and appeared in trouble, possibly low on fuel.
   ``Then they lost contact,'' Ms. Suarez said by telephone. ``It
appears to be a foreign plane.''
   Ms. Suarez said authorities immediately dispatched police units
and a helicopter to search the area.
   The co-pilot was Susan Reynolds, 25, of Dallas, according to the
craft's owner, Roger Crownrich. The name of the pilot was not
immediately known.
   Crownrich, who owns Crownrich Construction Management Inc. in
Dallas, said the jet was used for his business most of the time but
was on a charter run at the time of the crash.
   Ms. Reynolds and a pilot routinely flew to Memphis to pick up
Federal Express packages for delivery, he said. But Crownrich said
the regular pilot was not aboard the latest flight.
   ``It came as a bolt of lighting to me,'' said Crownrich. ``I flew
the plane yesterday to Detroit and it was just purring like a
kitten'' at up to 45,000 feet, which is its normal flying altitude.
   He said something could have happened to the plane's occupants or
the craft could have been sabotaged.
   ``It is pretty obvious that the plane was performing well and was
bound to be on auto pilot, and it flew that course on until fuel
starvation,'' he said. ``But why the pilot and co-pilot were not
able to talk to the flight service is beyond me.''

   Sinhalese extremists killed more than
425 people the past month in an attempt to disrupt Monday's
presidential election, officials said today.
   Cabinet minister Vincent Perrera said 405 people were killed by
militants from Nov. 16 to Dec. 14 in Sinhalese-dominated central and
southern Sri Lanka.
   The minister spoke in Parliament before the 168-member house
voted 65-2 to extend indefinitely emergency laws in effect since
1983. The laws give the government broad powers to detain people
suspected of arson, violence and instigating strikes.
   At least 23 people were killed Thursday and Friday, police and
military officials said.
   The victims included three policemen killed Friday when suspected
Sinhalese extremists attacked police patrols in central Sri Lanka,
said the military officials, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules.
   The killings are part of a campaign of violence aimed at
disrupting presidential polls scheduled Monday. The People's
Liberation Front, the main militant Sinhalese group, has called for
a boycott of the polls, claiming they will not be conducted fairly.
   The group has called for the dismissal of the government and
organized a series of crippling strikes in the Sinhalese heartland.
It says the government gave too many concessions in a July 1987
peace accord aimed at ending a 5-year-old insurrection by guerrillas
from the minority Tamil community.
   Members of the front have been blamed for bomb attacks on
meetings of opposition presidential candidates Sirimavo Bandaranaike
and Ossie Abeygoonasekara.
   Two bombs exploded at a public meeting Friday addressed by Mrs.
Bandaranaike, a former prime minister and leader of the Sri Lanka
Freedom Party. She was unhurt.
   Abeygoonasekara, who represents the United Socialist Alliance,
which is composed of four leftist parties, has survived three
assassination attempts since he announced his candidacy last month.
   Monday's vote is to choose a successor to President Junius R.
Jayewardene, who by law cannot be elected to a third term. The
candidate of his United National Party is Prime Minister Ranasinghe
Premadasa.
   Sinhalese form 75 percent of the island's 16 million people.
Tamils make up 18 percent of the population.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting since 1983 for an independent
homeland on the island's north and east, claiming discrimination by
the Sinhalese in jobs and education.

   The nation's sophisticated defense
radars will be tuned once again to that familiar blip of Santa Claus
and his entourage crossing the northern skies this Christmas Eve.
   Officials at the North American Aerospace Defense Command say
they are planning their annual tracking of the well-identified
flying object, as they have for the past 32 Christmas Eves.
   NORAD began the Santa Claus watch during the 1955 Cold War-era
Christmas season when it scanned the skies for Soviet bomber attacks.
   But a misprint in a local store's newspaper advertisement gave a
telephone number for Santa that accidentally sent kids' calls right
into the unlisted ``red phone'' at the nation's combat operations
center.
   Col. Harry Shoup, after picking up the ``hot line'' to hear a
child's voice ask, ``Is this one of Santa's helpers?,'' played
along, and other airmen took shifts on the ``Santa line.''
   One airman, seized by the spirit, drew Santa with sleigh and
reindeer over northern Canada on the center's glass ``situation
board'' and tracked him over North America on Christmas Eve.
   Each Christmas Eve since then, Santa's blip rises from out of the
north on NORAD radar screens. NORAD announces that he has been
``escorted'' over North America by jet fighters, and he vanishes in
the wee hours of Christmas morning.

   Five ``C'' batteries have certainly brought
a charge to Barbara Freeman's life.
   Mrs. Freeman, 46, wrote an angry letter to the makers of Rayovac
batteries, complaining the batteries worked a little too well.
   Her husband, Duane, bought a radio-controlled model car in March
that required five ``C'' batteries. The car's instructions said the
vehicle would run for about one hour without needing new batteries.
   ``Your stupid batteries lasted for over four hours of constant
operation,'' Mrs. Freeman wrote in her letter to the Madison, Wis.,
company.
   When she came home from her secretarial service job, she found
the noise only mildly annoying. But things got worse.
   ``By 8 p.m. I was muttering under my breath,'' Mrs. Freeman
wrote. ``By 8:30 I had to throw both husband and toy out in the yard
to play for a while ... by 9:30 I was gritting my teeth; and by
approximately 10:18 those stupid batteries finally, thank God, ran
out.''
   Rayovac responded by sending her a bunch of flashlights and
batteries and also making a commercial based on her letter that has
been running nationwide since November.

   An alleged divorce-fixing scheme involving former
Miss America Bess Myerson struck at ``the firmest pillar of good
government,'' a prosecutor said as four days of closing arguments
ended.
   After hearing defense and prosecution lawyers finish their
summations on Friday, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan said he
would turn the case over to the jury after instructing them on the
law. The panel should get the case Monday afternoon.
   Miss Myerson, Miss America in 1945 and once New York City's
cultural affairs commissioner, is accused of trying to influence a
judge's rulings in the divorce of her lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso.
   According to prosecutors, former state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel slashed Capasso's weekly support payments to his
estranged wife weeks after Miss Myerson gave a $19,000-a-year city
job to the judge's daughter, Sukhreet Gabel, in August 1983.
   Miss Myerson, 64, Capasso, 43, and Mrs. Gabel, who turned 76
Friday, are all charged with plotting to fix the divorce and then
cover up the scheme.
   In addition, Miss Myerson is charged with obstruction of justice.
She faces a maximum 30 years in prison and $513,000 in fines if
convicted on all counts. Her co-defendants face up to 25 years and
$263,000 if convicted.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Abrams noted that carved on the
facade of the court building where the Capasso divorce proceedings
were conducted are the words: ``The true administration of justice
is the firmest pillar of good government.
   ``The scheme in this case, ladies and gentlemen, struck at that
pillar.''
   Previously, Myerson attorney Frederick Hafetz derided the
prosecution case as ``a soap opera, not a criminal trial.''
   But Abrams maintained: ``This is not a soap opera. It's a crime.''
   Most of the government case was based on circumstantial evidence
because neither an eyewitness to the alleged bribe plot nor tape
recording of it existed.
   The main prosecution witness, Sukhreet Gabel, testified that
after a grand jury began an investigation in 1986, Miss Myerson
urged her ``to keep your mouth shut'' because ``you could be
dangerous.''
   But on cross-examination, Ms. Gabel admitted her trial testimony
differed from what she had told investigators and the grand jury on
several occasions.
   Hafetz, who got Ms. Gabel to admit that electroshock treatments
for depression had left her memory like ``Swiss cheese,'' told the
jury that ``she's a walking definition of reasonable doubt.''
   To convict on any of the charges, jurors must find the government
proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

<HEAD>Japanese Ships Depart For Controversial Whaling Research Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials said four Japanese whaling
ships left today for the Antarctic, where they plan to catch 300
whales in a controversial research program.
   The departure of the fleet was delayed more than a week while
Japan tried to lessen U.S. opposition to the research plan.
   ``We wanted to show the United States that Japan is proceeding
seriously, within the provisions of the charter of the International
Whaling Commission,'' one official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Last spring, the U.S. government banned Japanese fishing boats
from U.S. waters because of the whaling research, which it charged
was ``diminishing the effectiveness'' of a moratorium on commercial
whaling imposed in 1986 by the 42-member Whaling Commission.
   ``Basic differences remain between the two sides,'' another
official said, also speaking on condition he not be named. ``We
believe that we have done everything possible to try to get the
United States to understand our position.''
   The efforts included visits by Japanese officials to the United
States and contacts by embassy officials in Washington, he said.
   Japan, the world's biggest consumer of whale meat, officially
ended its commercial whaling in the Antarctic at the end of the
1986-87 season, after it caught 1,941 whales.
   Last season it announced it would kill 875 whales for research
purposes but reduced that to 300 after international environmental
groups charged the research program was ``commercial whaling in
disguise.''
   Officials say Japanese whalers last year actually caught 273
whales, all minkes, a variety not in immediate danger of extinction.
   ``From our perspective, some groups in the United States have
been taking the whaling issue to an extreme, turning it into a moral
question rather than a scientific question,'' the second official
said. ``Japanese people don't see why you shouldn't kill even one
minke whale if more than 700,000 currently exist, and don't believe
that eating whales makes you a barbarian.''
   The whaling commission passed the commercial whaling moratorium
to give scientists a chance to evaluate whale stocks. The moratorium
is to be evaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research findings.
   Under the commission's charter, each member country is able to
conduct whaling research whenever it wishes. However, environmental
groups have charged Japan is using that clause as a way to get
around the whaling ban and maintain its whaling industry.
   Japanese officials, in turn, charge other commission members have
not been seriously conducting research during the moratorium period
and plan merely to renew the ban in 1990. Only a minority of
commission members are whaling nations.
   Japanese officials say a representative sampling of whales must
be killed to accurately study their age, sex, diet and health.
Anti-whaling groups say other research methods are available that
don't involve killing.
   Japan hopes the research will prove there are sufficient numbers
of some whale species, such as the minke, to allow resumption of
limited commercial whaling in 1990.

   A Navy F-14 fighter jet
struck another jet while attempting to land and crashed into nearby
waters, but both crewmen aboard escaped uninjured, authorities said.
   The fighter crashed shortly before 7 p.m. Friday on approach to a
runway at the air station, which occupies the northern end of an
island 5 miles east of San Francisco, said Coast Guard Lt. Michael
Sullivan.
   ``The whole plane was shattered into pieces of debris,'' said
Coast Guard Coxswain Louis Hubbard, who was in charge of one of the
rescue boats.
   The pilot and radar officer, who ejected from the aircraft, were
pulled from the Alameda Estuary, one by a passing tugboat. The other
was found about 150 yards from shore by the Coast Guard rescue boat.
   The crewmen, who were not identified, were taken to a naval
hospital by ambulance, Sullivan said. He added both were in ``very
good condition'' and were being observed for possible effects of
shock.
   The aircraft was one of three F-14s in Alameda from Miramar Naval
Air Station near San Diego. The others had landed and the third was
about to touch down when it clipped a wing of one of the F-14s
already on the runway, said Navy spokesman Bill Valente.
   The plane then veered off and crashed, sinking in about 12 feet
of water, Valente said.
   In 1972, the $30 million F-14 Tomcat became the standard fleet
flighter aboard aircraft carriers. It was popularized in the movie
``Top Gun'' starring Tom Cruise.
   The plane's wings can extend to 64 feet for takeoff and landing
and can be swept back to 33 feet to reduce air drag at high speeds.

<TEXT>
   Accused American high-tech
smuggler Charles McVey lost another round in his complex legal
battle to avoid extradition to the United States.
   McVey failed Friday to win an appeal after three days of
arguments before the British Columbia Supreme Court.
   The U.S. government is attempting to extradite McVey, 63, to face
charges of selling classified high-technology computer equipment to
the Soviet Union.
   However, there have been a series of legal battles and appeals in
the case that started when McVey was arrested in August 1987 while
on a fishing trip to the Yukon.
   McVey, being held in Vancouver, was indicted in 1983 by the U.S.
government on conspiracy-related charges in connection with the
shipment of computer equipment to the Soviet Union from four
computer shops he owned in Anaheim, Calif.
   McVey has denied he was part of a scheme to defraud the
California-based Saxpy Computer Corp. of proprietary rights to its
super computer.
   The legal action Friday related to an Aug. 5 order by Justice
Alan MacDonell that McVey be extradited. MacDonell had ruled he
believed there was sufficient evidence to try McKey on charges of
defrauding the defunct computer company.
   McVey's lawyer, Robert Anderson, argued this week for a habeas
corpus application that was in effect an appeal of the MacDonell
decision.
   Anderson said Friday he intends now to appeal the case before the
British Columbia Court of Appeal.

   Southern Bell has reversed a decision to limit
installations and repairs at four crime-riddled public housing
projects, one of which is so violent that letter carriers get police
escorts.
   The phone company had scaled back service in Bankhead Courts and
the Englewood, Gilbert Gardens and Jonesboro South apartments after
a female technician was harassed at Gilbert Gardens by six men who
accused her of being a police officer. One man drew a gun while the
others rifled her van.
   The woman was released when the resident whose phone she had
repaired came outside and vouched for her, phone company spokesman
Doug Kendig said.
   The company had restricted service calls to Monday mornings,
except for emergencies, and only allowed workers to enter the
projects in groups.
   Southern Bell officials announced Friday that they were changing
that policy and said they had scheduled a meeting Monday with Police
Chief Morris Redding to discuss security precautions.
   The Bankhead Courts housing project has a reputation for danger.
Crime statistics on the project itself were unavailable, but the
Zone 1 police precinct, which covers the 25 square miles
encompassing the project, reported 41 homicides, 122 rapes and 609
robberies in 1987, said police spokeswoman Myrna May. In October
1988, the zone reported six homicides, 16 rapes and 145 robberies,
she said.
   Mayor Andrew Young had condemned the phone service cutback, and
Atlanta Housing Authority spokeswoman Cynthia Hoke said that the
authority was ``outraged'' by it.
   Postal officials suspended service in the project for one day,
after shots were fired near a letter carrier Dec. 10. City officials
criticized the move, and service to the 500-unit complex resumed
Wednesday under police escort.
   Kendig said the initial decision to restrict service calls
resulted because ``we've had folks flash guns and pull knives on our
installers, and threaten to use explosives on our vans.''
   The service restrictions were the latest events in the Bankhead
Courts crime drama, which police officials say has been violent and
drug-ridden for most of its 19 years.
   Four police officers were injured there while making arrests in a
Nov. 5 drug sweep that led to the arrest of 12 residents. A Nov. 10
raid, by 37 officers, led to 27 arrests _ nine on drug charges and
18 for traffic violations and other charges.
   A 24-year-old woman, who journeyed into the complex with friends,
was killed Nov. 3 when a drug dealer, fearing undercover police
officers, opened fire on her car as it approached with its
headlights off.

<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for the television performers
union has confirmed a report that union leaders are preparing for a
``possible work stoppage'' against the three networks.
   Pamm Fair of the 68,000-member American Federation of Television
and Radio Artists said Friday a report in Daily Variety that a
strike may be imminent is correct.
   Variety said that AFTRA's national executive director, John Hall,
was told by the union's board ``to take the necessary steps
precedent to a possible work stoppage.''
   AFTRA's contract with the networks expired Nov. 15. Intensive
negotiations since then have been unable to produce a settlement
acceptable to both parties.
   The talks will resume Jan. 16.
   A strike by AFTRA, whose members are now working with a
day-to-day contract extension, would cripple television production.
AFTRA covers such luminaries as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Dan
Rather, Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and more than 3,000 other network
employees.
   The contract affects all network news broadcasts, sports
programs, soap operas, game shows and variety shows. The networks'
prime-time videotaped series, like ``The Cosby Show,'' are not
affected by the talks.
   Actors on those shows, as well as those on prime-time filmed
programs such as ``Moonlighting,'' are covered by a separate joint
agreement with AFTRA and the Screen Actors Guild.
   The fall television season was delayed this year by a 22-week
strike by screenwriters against motion picture and television
producers.

   Wall Street is a house divided as Christmas
approaches, with merger specialists raking in big year-end bonuses
while brokers fear layoffs because of the slump in stock trading.
   ``Somebody could easily say it's like Charles Dickens: It's the
best of times, it's the worst of times,'' said PJ Johnson, a
spokesman for Nomura Securities International Inc.
   The surge of takeover business this year has enriched investment
bankers. The kingpin of leveraged buyouts, Henry Kravis of Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., is likely to earn $40 million to $50 million
or more this year, estimated Perrin Long, an analyst for Lipper
Analytical Services Inc.
   Meanwhile, Wall Streeters whose livelihoods depend on the volume
of stock trading are suffering because transactions by individuals
and institutions have tailed off since the crash of Oct. 19, 1987.
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. announced this week it had laid
off about 120 employees, largely in its municipal bond and stock
departments. That was a fraction of the 1,800 that Grumman Corp.
announced it will lay off come January, but it nonetheless sent
tremors through Wall Street.
   Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co. that
depends heavily on retail brokerage business, saw its profits
slashed in half through the first nine months of the year. It has
had no major layoffs and none are in the works, but many brokers who
work on straight commissions have left.
   ``The mood is probably as bad as I've seen it since 1972 or 1973
when the bear market was really bad,'' said Bard Quku, a senior vice
president for sales at Dean Witter in New York.
   Quku said his own business has held up well. But he said,
``There's some people who are losing hope.''
   ``The mood has not been a real jovial one the last month or
two,'' said Gary Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, an
executive recruiting firm that specializes in top-paying Wall Street
jobs.
   Spirits have picked up recently as it became apparent that
bonuses overall would not be slashed from their 1987 levels,
Goldstein said. Bonuses may fall 20 percent to 50 percent for stock
traders and municipal finance specialists, but rise for investment
bankers, he estimated.
   Income producers like sales people and investment bankers get
money from a bonus pool based mainly on performance. Back-office
employees, from mailroom clerks to the personnel director, are
getting bonuses equalling about 20 weeks of their salaries.
   The decline in living standards is, of course, all relative.
   ``Even in this operating environment, anyone who wants to work
hard and has a little bit of luck, he or she can probably make more
on Wall Street than just about anyplace else,'' Long said.
   Retrenchment in many cases means selling a second house or
forgoing an expensive vacation. ``I spoke to someone yesterday who
had a horse farm in Princeton who's selling the horses, selling the
farm,'' Goldstein said.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. canceled money for Christmas parties
this year, as it did in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market
crash, but employees in retail trading put up $100 apiece so they
could have their own party Friday night.
   ``We only took the hundred bucks from the people we thought could
afford it, the ones making six figures,'' said Peter DaPuzzo, the
senior executive vice president for retail trading.
   ``Everybody has confidence at Shearson that this, too, will pass
and things will get better,'' DaPuzzo said.
   The downturn on Wall Street has provoked some to go into
businesses they once disdained. Goldstein said he knew of a Harvard
Business School graduate, who probably made $1 million a year at his
peak, who left investment banking to go into the family clothing
retailing business.
   David Resler, chief economist of Nomura Securities, writes a
yuletide review of the year each Christmas, and this year the theme
was the slump on Wall Street. It said in part:
   ``The year eighty-eight found the markets less frisky
   ``As investors judged trading as overly risky.
   ``So many decided, on the sidelines they'd stay
   ``And the rest took great care when the markets they'd play.''

<TEXT>
   The widow of Prime Minister Olof Palme
has agreed to try to identify a 41-year-old Swede being held in the
investigation of her husband's assassination, a newspaper reported
today.
   Christer Pettersson, who was arrested Wednesday, pleaded innocent
Friday in a preliminary hearing, but a judge ruled there were
reasonable grounds to suspect he killed Palme and ordered him held
for further investigation.
   Palme, the dominant figure in Swedish politics for more than a
decade, was killed Feb. 28, 1986 while walking home unguarded from a
downtown movie theater with his wife Lisbet. Mrs. Palme was grazed
by a bullet in the shooting, which took place at close range.
   The Expressen newspaper said Mrs. Palme was willing to try to
identify the suspect but that it remained unclear whether she would
be summoned to do so.
   ``We would like to spare her as long as possible,'' the newspaper
quoted a source close to the investigation as saying. ``If we can do
without her testimony we will try to do that.''
   In another development, prosecutor Jorgen Almblad complained
about the publication of Pettersson's picture in foreign newspapers,
saying that would complicate the case.
   ``If a witness says he has seen the photograph of a suspect in
the paper, the value of the evidence will be rather low at a
confrontation,'' Almblad said on Swedish Radio.
   Several witnesses have identified Pettersson as the man seen
standing outside the movie theater before the Palmes emerged, press
reports said Saturday. But no evidence has emerged that he was the
gunman.
   The killer followed the couple down the street for several blocks
before the shooting, then escaped down a dark alley.
   Sweden's press and libel regulations prohibit publication in this
country of the names and pictures of suspects in criminal cases, in
some instances even after a person has been convicted.
   However, personal information about Swedes is easily available
from various national offices. Since his arrest, Petterson's name
has been a matter of public record, and anyone can obtain a picture
of him for a 50-cent fee at the central passport office.
   Public records show Pettersson has a history of psychiatric
treatment, drug and alcohol abuse and a long criminal record,
including a conviction for manslaughter. Norwegian, Danish and
English papers published the name and photograph of Pettersson, and
foreign papers available in Stockholm were sold out at some news
stands.
   Many papers hailed the arrest and Friday's arraignment as a major
breakthrough in a case that has been a national frustration for
nearly three years. Government commissions accused police of
bungling in the crucial first days of the manhunt.
   The chief investigator has been replaced twice, and a private
investigation led to the resignation of Justice Minister Anna-Greta
Leijon in June. But prosecutors have put forward no motive, and the
murder weapon was not found.
   ``After nearly three years of uncertainty, the Palme murder is
now on the way to a solution,'' anchor man Jarl Alfredius said on
Friday's nightly news.

   The Roman Catholic cardinal of Cebu
and two other priests were attacked and beaten during Mass today by
a man who told authorities he was possessed by the devil, police
said.
   Police and witnesses said Eduardo Espinosa barged into a church
in Talisay, seven miles south of this provincial city, rushed the
altar and struck Cardinal Ricardo Vidal in the face with his fist.
The cleric, his nose bloodied, fell back and hit his head on the
altar, authorities said.
   Police said two other priests, Rev. Achilles Dakay and Rev.
Hermingildo Montecillo, rushed to the cardinal's aid and also were
beaten.
   Dakay, a spokesman for the cardinal, said the attacker then raced
down the aisle, but parishoners intervened to beat and subdue him
until police arrived.
   Vidal, 57, is one of two cardinals in the Philippines. The other,
Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, is archbishop of Manila.
   Dakay said Vidal was able to complete the Mass, then drove to a
hospital where he was treated for facial and head contusions.
   Police officer Hannibal Larida said Espinosa, 33, was quoted as
telling police he was ``out of my mind'' when he attacked the
cardinal.
   ``It was an order from Satan,'' Larida quoted him as saying. The
police officer said Espinosa is a suspected drug addict.
   The Radio station DYHP said Espinosa had been in and out of
mental hospitals in Cebu since the 1970s.
   The station also quoted police as saying Espinosa may have
belonged to a satanic cult active in Cebu.
   In another development, President Corazon Aquino today pardoned
or shortened sentences for 155 convicts as part of her government's
program to ease extreme punishment for inmates.
   A presidential palace statement said the order included
conditional pardons for four convicts, parole for 13 and the
commutation of sentences for 138 others. The statement did not say
what crimes the prisoners committed.

   Mstislav Rostropovich, the Soviet-born cellist, and
flutist James Galway will join other leading musicians in a charity
concert tonight for victims of the Armenian earthquake.
   The concert will be televised in six countries, including the
Soviet Union, and broadcast live to an estimated 25 million
listeners by the British Broadcasting Corp.'s World Service,
according to a sponsor, The Times newspaper, and the BBC.
   Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife Princess
Diana were expected to be among the 2,000 specators at the sold-out
Barbican Hall.
   Organized by the British Association of Concert Agents, the
concert is part of a ``Musicians for Armenia'' appeal, which expects
to raise $452,000 from the concert, from donors, including 450
musicians worldwide, and from the film and recording rights to the
concert.
   Conductor Andre Previn, who will lead the English Chamber
Orchestra at the concert, said at a rehearsal this afternoon that it
was ``amazing'' that the musicians had been free. ``In our business
everyone's booked up for the next two or three yers,'' he said. ``It
was just good fortune that everyone could make it at such short
notice.''
   Rostropovich, who gave his first solo concert in Britain in
nearly two decades on Friday also in aid of Armenia, will play
Villa-Lobos' Bachianas Brasileiras No. 1. He will also play the
piano in accompanying his Soviet-born wife, soprano Galina
Vishnevskaya, in songs by Tchaikovsky. Rostropovich is of Armenian
descent but an American citizen.
   The program will include Galway playing Dubussy's Syrinx and
Previn conducting the English Chamber Orchestra in Beethovan's
Coriolan Overture.
   Soviet pianist Andrei Gavrilov, whose family in Armenia escaped
injury in last week's quake, will play Mozart and Chopin.
   The musicians will also include violist Yuri Bashmet, pianist
Barry Douglas and violinist Cho-Liang Lin.
   Everyone connected with the event, from program printers to
Barbican staff and the musicians, donated their services.
   The income plus the entire cost of the tickets, except tax, was
to go to the British Red Cross Armenian Earthquake Appeal fund.
   Tickets ranged in price from $18 to $45.
   The Times reported that the concert was to be televised in Spain,
the Netherlands, Ireland, Australia, Belgium and the Soviet Union.

   Student radicals and dissidents today
attacked a government party office and staged anti-government
demonstrations demanding the arrest of the disgraced former
president, Chun Doo-hwan.
   News reports said about a dozen students briefly occupied an
office of President Roh Tae-woo's governing Democratic Justice Party
in the southern city of Chonju. ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan,'' they
shouted while attacking the office and destroying windows with rocks
and steel pipes, according to the reports.
   Police, firing tear gas, retook the building in 20 minutes and
arrested six students, the reports said. The other students ran
away, they said.
   In southern Seoul, 1,200 radical students and dissidents held an
outdoor rally denouncing Roh for blocking public efforts to divulge
more details of misdeeds committed during Chun's administration.
   They dispersed voluntarily after a two-mile march down a main
street. About 4,000 riot police were posted, but no clashes were
reported.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, 300 people, mostly students,
marched peacefully through downtown streets, shouting slogans
demanding Chun's arrest, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said.
They dispersed in two hours, it said.
   Chun, who left office in February, went into self-imposed rural
exile last month after apologizing to the nation for corruption and
other scandals involving his seven-year authoritarian rule.
   Chun denied personal wrongdoing, but some of his family members
have been arrested for taking bribes or embezzeling official funds.

   After 20 years in Congress and more than
a month spent challenging his 791-vote loss to a Republican newcomer
in the Nov. 8 general election, Democratic U.S. Rep. William
Chappell has formally conceded.
   Craig James, whose campaign emphasized reports linking Chappell
to investigations of the Pentagon procurement scandal, defeated the
10-term incumbent by less than 1 percent of about 250,000 votes cast
in the northeast Florida district.
   ``I must acknowledge the Republican Party has won the seat in the
4th Congressional District of Florida, and I have decided against
pursuing a challenge any further,'' Chappell said Friday.
   Chappell, 66, sought to have the Florida Supreme Court throw out
nearly 11,000 votes from Flagler County because they arrived at the
state division of elections office one day after a seven-day state
deadline. That would have given him a 229-vote victory, but the
court turned back his request Nov. 30.
   Chappell has not been charged in any investigation of defense
contractors.

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat said today the Palestine
Liberation Organization's main priority in talks with the United
States is to push for an international peace conference on the
Middle East.
   Speaking with reporters after his arrival in Tunis a day after
the historic opening of an official U.S.-PLO dialogue, Arafat also
said he would do his best to prevent his followers from carrying out
any terrorist attacks.
   The PLO chairman described as a ``step in the right direction''
Friday's meeting between U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau Jr. and a
four-man PLO delegation. Arafat said the PLO's prime objective in
the talks is ``to push forward for the international conference to
be held very soon.''
   Israel has rejected proposals for an international conference on
the Middle East, which would include the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council _ Britain, France, China, the United
States and the Soviet Union _ and the parties to the conflict.
   Asked if he could assure that no Palestinian terrorist attacks
would be staged, Arafat said it is difficult to control all
individuals or groups, but he added, ``We will do all our best to
stop all this.''
   Arafat also suggested, without providing any details, that he
played a role in the freeing Friday in Lebanon of Peter Winkler, a
Swiss official of the International Committee of the Red Cross who
had been kidnapped a month earlier. No group claimed responsibility
for his abduction.
   ``When I was in Geneva, the chief of the Red Cross asked me to
help release the Swiss employee, and he has been released,'' Arafat
said without elaborating.
   He condemned Israeli soldiers for killing at least four
Palestinians during clashes in the occupied lands on Friday.
   Arafat called it ``continuing state terrorism.'' He said, ``It is
a message from the Israeli military junta and the Israeli leaders
(who are) still refusing to accept peace, a just peaceful
settlement.''
   Arafat said the PLO and the United States had agreed to meet
again, but he did not say when. The chief PLO spokesman, Ahmed
Abdul-Rahman, said the next talks would take place after
President-elect George Bush takes office Jan. 20.
   Friday's meeting between delegations led by Pelletreau and Yasser
Abd-Rabbou, a member of the PLO executive committee, came two days
after Washington reversed a longstanding policy of refusing to deal
with the PLO.
   Washington said it did so because the PLO met conditions set for
the talks, including recognizing Isreal's right to exist and
renouncing terrorism.
   The historic session inspired hope in many quarters that advances
can be made in the Middle East peace process, which had stagnated
recently.
   ``We hope the application of this change in the policy of the
United States will be practiced through a real pressure on Israel in
order to change the policy of occupation, the policy of terrorism,
the policy of oppression against our Palestinian people,''
Abd-Rabbou said after the 90-minute session Friday.
   ``Our discussions were very practical and characterized, I would
say, by seriousness of purpose,'' Pelletreau said after his
90-minute session with a four-man PLO delegation. The U.S.
ambassador implied there would be other meetings but did not say
when.
   ``It is our hope that this dialogue, as it develops, will help
bring about direct negotiations that will lead to comprehensive
peace,'' said Pelletreau, who was accompanied to the talks by Edmund
Hull, political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis.
   The meeting took place at Dar Maghrebia, an official Tunisian
government guest residence in Carthage, a suburb just north of
Tunis. Neither side gave substantive details of the talks.

   The mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia
today rescued three Irish soldiers serving with the U.N.
peacekeeping force who had been kidnapped a day earlier by
pro-Iranian guerrillas in south Lebanon.
   Lebanon's most influential Shiite Moslem cleric was quoted as
saying he had ``suspended'' efforts to win the release of 14
foreigners held hostage. His comment was published today, one day
after a Swiss hostage was freed.
   ``I have suspended my initiative on behalf of the hostages
because it reached a dead end,'' the Beirut daily newspaper Al-Liwaa
quoted Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah as saying. Fadlallah is the
spiritual guide of Hezbollah, the umbrella group for pro-Iranian
factions holding most hostages.
   Red Cross worker Peter Winkler, 32, was freed Friday night in
Hisbeh Square in the southern city of Sidon, the same spot where he
was abducted Nov. 17. The Swiss Foreign Ministry said Winkler would
probably fly home Sunday via Cyprus.
   The abduction of the Irish soldiers occurred Friday in Tibnin, a
village bordering Israel's self-proclaimed security zone. The
abductions were apparently intended to retaliate for Israel's
seizure Thursday of guerrilla commander Jawad Kasfi in Tibnin.
   Police sources said the kidnappers demanded the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon, with which the Irish soldiers served, negotiate
with Israel for the release of Kasfi and three other guerrillas
seized Thursday by Israel.
   The Israeli military command said Kasfi was suspected of
organizing and participating in kidnappings and dozens of attacks
against Israeli army forces and the allied South Lebanon Army
militia since 1984.
   Today's rescue was daring, resulting in the capture of 22 Shiite
zealots who helped abduct the Irish soldiers, a police spokesman
said.
   The spokesman said the three were rescued from a house in
Sultaniyeh, a village one mile outside Tibnin, headquarters of the
620-strong Irish battalion serving with the U.N. peacekeeping force.
   The rescue operation, according to the spokesman, was completed
at dawn when 15 guerrillas of the ``Faithful Resistance surrendered
to Amal and set free the three Irish soldiers.''
   The Faithful Resistance is a small group of Shiite
fundamentalists affiliated with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
   ``The fighters surrendered after Amal militiamen, in a smart and
quiet move, arrested the Faithful Resistance's seven commanders in
the whole region,'' the spokesman said. ``The fighters surrendered
because they didn't know what to do after Amal arrested their
commanders. They surrendered peacefully.''
   Winkler, who spoke to journalists as he was driven out of Sidon
on his way to Beirut, said of his captivity, ``I've never known that
four weeks can be as long as that.''
   Asked if he would resume Red Cross work in Lebanon, Winkler said:
``I'm afraid I will have to leave Lebanon soon. ... My enthusiasm
has suffered.''
   Winkler looked fit, with no sign of maltreatment.
   In Bern, Swiss Foreign Minister Rene Felber said today that
Winkler's captors tried to tie his release to a lenient sentence for
a jailed Lebanese plane hijacker, Hussein Hariri, but Switzerland
refused any concessions.
   Felber said that in indirect contacts, the kidnappers identified
themselves as members of a dissident Palestinian group named
``Organization of Socialist Revolution.''
   Sweden's ambassador in Damascus, Rolf Gauffin, acted as
intermediary after the hijackers contacted him Tuesday, Felber told
a press conference. He said recent talks between a Swiss official
and Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat also were
``useful.'' He did not elaborate.
   At a news conference in Tunisia today, Arafat suggested, without
providing any details, that he played a role in the freeing Winkler.
   Edouard Brunner, the Swiss Foreign Ministry's No. 2 man, met
Arafat Wednesday when the PLO chief was in Geneva for a U.N. General
Assembly session.
   Brunner told reporters today that Arafat asked for a drawing of
the place where Winkler was kidnapped to determine whether it was in
Palestinian-controlled territory.
   The recent political successes of the PLO may also have
contributed to Winkler's early release, Brunner said.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station said
Winkler was released by the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the
guerrilla group headed by Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.
   A police spokesman quoted Winkler as saying he did not know the
identity of those who held him but that the captors told him ``that
I was being held to guarantee that Hussein Hariri will be treated
well in Switzerland.''
   Hariri, a Shiite Moslem Lebanese, goes on trial in Lausanne on
Feb. 20 on charges of hijacking an Air Afrique jetliner on July 14,
1987, and forcing it to land at Geneva airport. He is accused of
killing a French passenger.
   Winkler's release leaves 14 foreigners, including nine Americans,
held hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Two men accused of promising free new

been indicted for allegedly bilking more than 4,000 people out of $1
million, authorities said.
   Samuel Filippo, 42, and Robert James Matthews, 40, were charged
in a federal grand jury indictment and face 16 counts of mail fraud.
Filippo also is charged with one count of using fictitious names.
   Both are fugitives. Offices for their National Marketing in
Venice have been closed; no forwarding address was left.
   The pair, according to the indictment returned Thursday, failed
to deliver anything more than $140 mopeds, despite promising
participants they would receive a revolutionary new motorcycles for
testing.
   Victims were told they had to pay $360 to $390 in promotional and
shipping costs for the bikes, but most never received anything, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Katz. About 1,000 people received a
moped valued at $140.
   If convicted, the pair would face up to 80 years in prison and $4
million in fines and restitution.

   A woman getting out of a taxicab fell through a
sidewalk subway grating 50 feet onto the tracks below, where she was
partially wedged beneath an electrified third rail, officials said.
   However, the 28-year-old woman apparently didn't touch the
600-volt third rail, officials said. She was hospitalized today in
critical condition with a broken pelvis and numerous cuts.
   The grating in Brooklyn may have been weakened because cars were
driven over it during road repairs, said Jared Lebow, a Transit
Authority spokesman.
   Transit officials said they didn't know whether Angela Williams
stepped onto the grating and it fell under her weight or whether it
had fallen into the air vent before the accident Thursday night. The
metal grating was found 11 feet down the shaft.
   Power was shut off within five minutes of the accident and
service was disrupted on two lines for 25 minutes, Lebow said.
   The six-lane parkway, which has single-lane access roads on both
sides, is under reconstruction. People living in buildings on the
access roads often drive across a median because their lanes are
blocked, Lebow said.

   Rats ate their way through wiring in the

China, forcing Air India to find another plane for Sunday's historic
trip, Press Trust of India said.
   The news agency quoted highly placed sources as saying aviation
engineers discovered the problem Wednesday in Bombay, headquarters
of Air India. Its report was broadcast Friday.
   Ghandi's trip to China will be the first by an Indian prime
minister in 34 years. India and China fought a bitter border war in
1962 and since then their relations have been uneasy.
   Rats are in abundance in India and are considered holy by the
Hindus, the country's religious majority.

<TEXT>
   Rajiv Gandhi comes to China Monday for the first
visit by an Indian prime minister since his grandfather, Jawalharlal
Nehru, made the trip 34 years ago.
   For Gandhi's nation and his political future, the stakes appear
high. For China, little seemingly can go wrong.
   During a week long on symbolism but short on substance, Gandhi
will be feted in the capital, tour the ancient city of Xian and
visit Shanghai.
   The visit, Gandhi recently said, will be ``very important ... for
this globe, for Asia and for both of us.''
   The two nations _ the world's most populous _ will probably sign
agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and
technology, Indian and Western diplomats said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. China and India also may agree to establish consular
offices.
   But no substantial progress is expected on the critical issue of
their 2,400-mile border, over which the two countries fought a brief
war in 1962.
   The two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little
progress. China claims 36,000 square miles of Indian territory.
India rejects the claim and demands that China return the 15,200
square miles it took in the 1962 war.
   Since then, relations have improved, but only slightly. The
border remains heavily guarded on both sides and bilateral trade,
which resumed in 1977 but amounted to only $150 million last year,
is limited.
   Both China and India say Gandhi's visit is intended to create an
atmosphere for greater communication and not to resolve the border
question. But Western diplomats said pressures on Gandhi could make
him more willing to compromise than his Chinese counterparts.
   China is moving quickly to improve relations with the Soviet
Union after nearly three decades of hostility. A summit between
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping may be held next year.
   Better Chinese-Soviet relations will eliminate Moscow's need to
cultivate New Dehli as a foil against Beijing. And by removing
tensions along its northern border, China will be under less
pressure to accomodate India on its southern flank.
   China continues its close relationship with Pakistan, India's
traditional enemy. Pakistan's new prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, is
expected to visit China in January on her first official trip abroad.
   ``For Gandhi, the whole visit has an air of him running along so
he doesn't get left out in the cold,'' said a Western diplomat in
Beijing who recently returned from New Delhi. ``For the Chinese, the
visit can't possibly go wrong.''
   A society that speaks with one voice when it comes to foreign
affairs, China has watched with apparent enjoyment as the Indian
press has pressured Gandhi to make progress on the border issue,
Western diplomats said.
   ``The prime minister has decided to stick yet another label to
his travel bags,'' wrote the normally pro-government Times of India
in an editorial Wednesday. ``The more important question, however,
is, what is the prime minister going to China for?''
   Gandhi also faces an election next year in which victory is far
from certain. Diplomats say he must convince his public that simply
establishing goodwill with the Chinese _ and not achieving a
dramatic breakthrough _ is a worthy goal.
   ``If he feels that he is failing at that, he might be persuaded
to do something rash,'' the Western diplomat said.
   India could use the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader who has
taken refuge in India since 1959, to embarrass the Chinese. The
Tibetan refugees' parliament-in-exile on Friday called on Gandhi to
raise the issue of Tibet with Chinese leaders.
   But India's hand is weakened by China's apparent willingness to
crush dissent in Tibet, regardless of international opinion. On Dec.
10, police shot and killed at least one monk in Lhasa, the capital
of Tibet, during an anti-Chinese demonstration. In addition, New
Delhi also has backed China's claims to the region.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
China in the early 1950s. Relations soured in the early 1960s over
the border question and political disagreements.
   Relations improved slightly in the late 1970s. China invited an
Indian leader to visit as early as 1979, but India agreed to come
only in November of last year.
   Western diplomats say the timing of the acceptance was
significant because it came well after Sino-Soviet relations had
begun to improve.

   Ireland's state-run lottery says it will
supply free syringes, needles and contraceptives to drug addicts to
help cut down their risk of contracting AIDS.
   The state-funded Eastern Health Board agreed to distribute the
items from two of its Dublin centers because of a high incidence of
needle sharing among drug addicts in the capital. The decisions were
made Friday.
   Three years ago, the Irish Parliament approved a bill to legalize
over-the-counter sales of contraceptives to anyone over 18 without a
doctor's prescription.
   It was the first time in the state's history that a government
had won a battle with the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes the
use of contraceptives. About 97 percent of the population is
Catholic.
   Lottery proceeds are used to finance projects in health, sports,
the arts and the Irish language.

   Czechoslovakia has stopped its
longtime jamming of the U.S.-owned Radio Free Europe broadcasting
network, the government announced today.
   Miroslav Pavel, a government spokesman, told The Associated Press
that jamming of Radio Free Europe was discontinued Friday and that
all other jammers were gradually switched off.
   The government also stopped jamming Deutsch Welle, a West German
station broadcasting in many languages, including Czech, according
to a source who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
   The Czechoslovak plan to stop obstructing Western broadcasts was
announced earlier this week by Pavel and by diplomats in Vienna
attending the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   In Munich, Bill Marsh, Radio Free Europe executive vice
president, said Czechoslovakia has been jamming the network since
1968.
   Marsh said that with the Czech move, Bulgaria is the last Soviet
bloc country that continues to obstruct Radio Free Europe broadcast
signals.

<HEAD>Bush Will Sail To Ceremonial Victory In Electoral College</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 48 million people cast ballots for
George Bush for president six weeks ago, but the 538 who really
matter will vote Monday.
   That's when the Electoral College meets in an antiquated and much
maligned constitutional ritual that has survived for two centuries.
   Expect no surprise here. Bush should defeat Democrat Michael
Dukakis by 426 votes to 112 votes _ give or take a ``faithless
elector.''
   In state capitals around the nation on Monday, the electors will
meet to cast their votes and sign half a dozen documents swearing
they've done their duty.
   This sets the stage for the final ceremony in a joint session of
Congress on Jan. 4, when Vice President George Bush, as president of
the Senate, will open the ballots and anounce the results _ and
formally declare himself the president-elect.
   The political parties in each state pick prospective electors _
one for each congressman and senator the state has.
   While voters on Nov. 8 may have thought they were voting for one
of the presidential candidates, they really were casting their
ballots for the Republican or Democratic slate of electors in their
state. The party that wins a state sends its electors to the meeting
set by law for Monday.
   Among those who have the honor and duty are some of the vice
president's relatives: son Neil Bush, in Colorado and brother
Prescott S. Bush Jr. in Connecticut.
   ``I think it was a nice honor, to get to cast a vote for my
dad,'' Neil Bush, a Denver oilman, said. ``It'll be nice to be a
small footnote in history.''
   Among others with the duty are Bush's designated White House
chief of staff, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu. Penn State football
coach Joe Paterno, who seconded Bush's nomination at the Republican
National Convention, is a Pennsylvania elector. But most are state
party workers or insiders rewarded for their labors, and state
officeholders, such as California Gov. George Deukmejian and Alabama
Gov. Guy Hunt.
   In the 10 states and the District of Columbia that were carried
by Michael Dukakis, Democratic electors will vote.
   Electors are expected to vote for their party's presidential
nominee and vice presidential nominee. But in this unique American
system, they don't have to _ and therein lies the potential for
mischief or intrigue.
   In nearly 200 years, eight electors have broken their pledge and
voted for someone else.
   The lure of making some dramatic point, and gaining widespread if
fleeting notice, endures. A Minnesota elector, Bill Davis, treasurer
of the state Democratic-Farm-Labor Party, has said he may cast a
symbolic vote for Jesse Jackson for vice president instead of
Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the party's nominee.
   And this year, with the furor over Dan Quayle's selection as
Bush's Republican vice presidential running mate still fresh in
memory, some electors have been getting letters urging them to
``Dump Quayle'' and cast vice presidential ballots for someone else.
   ``Dan Quayle does not have to be the next vice president. Just
ask the framers of the Constitution, who devised the Electoral
College precisely to deal with the current predicament,'' law
journalist David A. Kaplan and New York lawyer Gary S. Simon wrote
in a New York Times opinion-page article last month.
   Such a case for rests on the argument that the founding fathers
envisioned the electors as truly deliberative. Of course, the
founding fathers didn't know about the emergence of the two dominant
parties, or a nation attuned to instantaneous communication, when
they added the provision during the constitutional convention of
1787 in Philadelphia. They saw it as an elite group of wise men to
be trusted with the decision.
   In fact, about half the states now have laws rquiring the
electors to vote as pledged. But experts say the laws might not pass
a constitutional test and may be unenforceable.
   In the past, some have proposed scrapping the entire Electoral
College system and provide for direct election. A middle-ground
proposal is to keep the electoral system but do away with electors _
that is, award electoral votes automatically.
   But all efforts to make such changes have fallen short in
Congress. The last serious effort was in 1979, when the change won a
majority in the Senate but fell well short of the two-thirds needed
for a consitutional amendment.
   The move was opposed by a conservatives, by small states that
feared they would be overlooked in campaigns without electoral
votes, and some black leaders and other minorities who shared
similar concerns.
   Former Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana _ who was unseated in 1980 by
Quayle _ sponsored the change. He argued that the system is
undemocratic because it poses the potential for a candidate to be
elected without winning the popular vote.
   That has happened: John Quincy Adams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayes
in 1876, and Benjamin Harrison in 1888.
   But don't look for it from the electors of 1988.
   ``They're going to do their duty, as the people instructed,''
said Republican National Committee press secretary Albert Maruggi.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Adviser Says Soviets Afraid of Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party Politburo member said in remarks
published Saturday that Soviets still are afraid of democracy and
openness despite more than three years of reform.
   ``We talk about political transformations, but how difficult it
is to part with the old power to which we are accustomed,''
Alexander N. Yakovlev said in the Ural Mountain city of Perm.
   ``We still cannot imagine that genuine people's power will be
simpler, more reliable and, of course, more responsible. Democracy,
glasnost, and differences of opinion still frighten us, as if every
one of us constantly lives in agreement with himself and always
thinks in comfortable cliches,'' Yakovlev said.
   ``Can you really call a person a person if he doesn't have his
own opinions?'' he said.
   His remarks to regional party officials were published by the
Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   Yakovlev is regarded as a theoretician of Gorbachev's reforms and
the closest adviser to the Soviet president on the Politburo.
   He called for an end to ``wage-leveling,'' the practice of giving
people the same pay regardless of the quality of the work they do.
Gorbachev has encouraged the practice of paying more for better work
in an effort to get Soviets to work harder and produce better goods.
   Yakovlev said that practice could be encouraged through the
cooperative movement, which allows Soviets working privately to
provide goods and services scarce in the state-run economy without
adhering to the official price and wage structure.
   Without the concept of pay according to work, he said, ``the
construction of socialism is a utopia; without it society, a person
is alienated from property and power.''
   Yakovlev said the new government structure approved last month
will have to earn the respect of Soviet citizens.
   Last month, the Supreme Soviet parliament approved Gorbachev's
plan for a new Congress of People's Deputies that will include
members selected from the Communist Party, trade unions and other
organizations. The new congress in turn will choose a smaller, more
active Supreme Soviet.
   Gorbachev's plan also calls for a stronger presidency.
   Gorbachev, who became Communist Party chief in 1985, has said
economic restructuring is needed in Soviet society. He also has
espoused glasnost, or greater openness on selected issues.

<HEAD>Outgoing Pentagon Chief Urges Tower To Fight For Budget Boost</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. John Tower, President-elect Bush's
choice as defense secretary, should let recent reforms to the
Pentagon's weapon-buying system take hold instead promising more
sweeping changes, says outgoing Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   Tower also should fight as hard as he can for a 2 percent
increase in the Pentagon's budget _ and not talk about accepting
less _ because anything less jeopardizes the nation's security and
the future of the all-volunteer force, Carlucci said.
   ``The last thing the Defense Department needs is somebody to come
in and yank the procurement system out by the roots again and say
we're going to reform it or change it,'' Carlucci said.
   ``The best reform for the procurement system is stability,
predictability. The blueprint is laid out ... we've made a large
number of changes in the procurement system. Real changes are taking
place in the procurement system and I am proud of them.''
   Carlucci was interviewed last week in his Pentagon office as he
awaited Bush's announcement of the man who would replace him.
   The 58-year-old defense chief, who said he was looking forward to
finding a job in the private sector but had yet to do so, talked at
length about what he considered his achievements, as well as the
problems he foresaw for Tower.
   Of the former, he claimed a measure of credit for:
   _Guiding the process and setting priorities in late 1987 in
slashing the Pentagon budget plans to comply with a White House
deficit compromise with Congress.
   ``We took it (cuts) in places the services didn't like and lost a
secretary of the Navy in the process,'' Carlucci said, referring to
the resignation of Navy Secretary James Webb over a decision to
retire 16 warships.
   _Protecting reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.
Carlucci noted he had just returned from a visit to the Middle East
``and our standing could not be higher.''
   ``The fact is that we got a high degree of cooperation from the
moderate Arab states. The Persian Gulf (work) has been a major
achievement.''
   _Taking a calm, measured approach to the disclosure of a
wide-ranging fraud investigation among Pentagon contractors and
private consultants. Carlucci said he had instituted a ``total
quality management program'' to impress on contractors the need for
quality products as well as ethical conduct.
   ``We're looking at more innovative ways to base competition on
quality and track record as opposed to pure price,'' he said.
   The defense secretary also cited success in ``establishing a good
rapport'' with his Soviet counterparts; impressing upon leaders
around the world the dangers posed by the proliferation of
long-range missiles; convincing Congress to pass legislation
allowing obsolete military bases to be closed, and getting Congress
through a ``silly season'' earlier this year when some politicians
were demanding the military be used to seal the nation's borders
against drugs.
   ``We've got the DOD role in drug interdiction sorted out in a way
that it is manageable, instead of having us seal the borders in 45
days or whatever the hell it was and shoot everybody who comes in.''
   On the problem side, Carlucci said Tower would have to fight for
a larger Pentagon budget; help develop arms control strategy, and
strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization while helping
European allies resist ``the seductive appeal of Soviet arms control
proposals.''
   If Bush and Tower can't convince Congress to approve a 2 percent
real growth increase in the fiscal 1990 budget, the only way to make
further cuts ``sensibly'' would be to reduce the size of the armed
forces, Carlucci said.
   If Navy deployments are lengthened, or tours for soldiers in
Europe increased, ``what does that do for recruitment and
retention?'' Carlucci asked.
   ``It's not a question of we can't afford it. If you look at the
domestic programs, they continue to go up at a rate of about 8
percent. Therefore, using that yardstick, I see nothing wrong with 2
percent in defense.''
   Asked then if he thought a Democratic Congress would actually go
along with an increase, Carlucci replied: ``Certainly if you don't
try, it's not politically do-able. With the Congress, my view is
that you've got to make your case.''
   Carlucci, who replaced Caspar W. Weinberger as defense secretary
for the last 14 months of the Reagan administration, said he had
enjoyed the position but found it truly was ``a full-time job.''
   ``On a per-hour basis, I make about as much as my babysitter,''
he joked, adding the secretary's salary of $99,500 is ``lousy.''

   An Ohio company is voluntarily recalling some
14,000 umbrella strollers to correct mechanical problems, according
to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The recall is being undertaken by Century Products Co. of
Macedonia, Ohio, in cooperation with the CPSC.
   It involves three strollers sold nationally: model numbers
11-066DI and 11-077SA sold under the E-Z Go brand name, and model
number 11-074SR sold by Sears as an ``Infant Umbrella-Style
Stroller.''
   Model numbers are found on the instruction sheet and a label on
the stroller's rear legs.
   Consumers having the stoller should stop using the product and
return it to the retail store where purchased for a full refund, the
CPSC said in a news release. For more information, consumers may
call 1-800-222-9825.
   The CPSC also announced that Century Products is offering a
redesigned replacement horn for its Century Roadster Walker.
   The horn, located in the center of the steering wheel, can be
torn or bitten off by a child. According to the commission there
have been 11 potential choking incidents reported.
   Consumers are urged to remove the horn immediately from the
steering wheel by grasping the horn with pliers and pulling it out.
   To receive the redesigned horn, consumers should write to Century
Products Co., 9600 Valley View Road, Macedonia, OH 44056 or after
Dec. 26 call 1-800-922-6700.

<HEAD>Opening Of Dialogue Latest Turn In US-PLO Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. decision to establish dialogue with
the Palestinian Liberation Organization ends 13 years of officially
shunning the PLO, a period which began not long after its leader
visited the United Nations toting a gun.
   But with the long and bitter tug of war over whether to talk to
each other ended, the United States and the PLO now begin a debate
over peace itself as a wary Israel watches.
   The existence of Israel _ its right to exist as a nation _ was at
the heart of the American cold shoulder.
   That policy was halted last week when PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
finally said the right words in Geneva, meeting a three-step test
set by the United States.
   He renounced terrorism.
   He accepted guidelines set by two United Nations resolutions
which implicity recognize Israel and hold out the prospect for
land-for-peace negotiations.
   And, casting aside previous ambiguities, he recognized ``the
right of all parties concerned in the Middle East conflict to exist
in peace and security ... including the state of Palestine, Israel
and other neighbors.''
   The United State had previously rejected other PLO formulations,
including a declaration by the Palestinian National Council, the PLO
parliament in exile, and in Arafat's United Nations speech.
   But when Arafat revised his statements a day after the U.N.
speech, Secretary of State George P. Shultz promptly ended the U.S.
policy of shunning all substantive contact with the PLO and said
dialogue would begin.
   It was a far call from the November 1974 day when Arafat, a
pistol strapped to his hip, walked to the U.N. podium in New York to
declare: ``I have come bearing an olive branch, and a freedom
fighter's gun.''
   Or the day in August 1979 when Andrew Young resigned as U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations after holding unauthorized talks
with PLO representatives.
   The no-talk policy was established in 1975 by then-Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger.
   The two U.N. Security Council resolutions which Kissinger
demanded the PLO accept sprang from wars Israel had fought against
invading Arab neighbors.
   Resolution 242 was adopted after the 1967 war in which Israel
seized the Arab West Bank and Gaza Strip territories.
   It decries acquisition of territory by war and speaks of ``the
need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every state in
the area can live in peace and security.'' The resolution calls for
Israel to remove its forces from occupied territories and for Arab
states to respect Israel's independence.
   Resolution 338, adopted during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, called
for a cease-fire and implementation of Resolution 242.
   Both resolutions speak of a negotiated settlement.
   The PLO was created by the Arab League in 1964 by welding
together a number of competing Palestinian groups, including
Arafat's Al Fatah. By 1970, it was conducting guerilla and terrorist
war against Israel from bases inside neighboring Jordan.
   Jordan's King Hussein in 1970 used his army to expel the PLO and
its major elements moved to Lebanon _ upsetting that country's
delicate Christian-Muslim balance and helping ignite the Lebanese
civil war.
   Terrorist attacks on Israel continued across Lebanon's southern
border and in June 1982 Israel invaded, hoping to expel the PLO.
   At that time the United States accepted PLO help in evacuating
Americans but officials said no substantive talks were involved.
   On Sept. 1, 1982, U.S. forces supervised the PLO's evacuation of
Beirut and the organization moved to its current headquarters in
Tunisia.
   PLO terrorist attacks continued through most of the 1980s and in
October 1985 the United States blamed PLO elements for the attack on
the cruise ship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean during which Leon
Klinghoffer, an American Jew confined to a wheelchair, was murdered.
   Despite worldwide condemnation of such acts, the PLO found
growing support for its ultimate aim, the establishment of a
Palestinian state in the occupied territories.
   Arab leaders in 1972 had declared the PLO the only legitimate
representative of Palestinians and two years later the U.N.
officially recognized the organization, granting it observer status.
   Although no official contacts were allowed, the PLO was permitted
to open an information office in Washington.
   In 1987, Congress ordered the closing of the PLO's Washington and
New York offices on grounds the PLO was a ``terrorist'' group. A
State Department attempt to close the PLO's U.N. office ended up in
court and the case has not been resoloved.
   Last month Shultz refused to allow Arafat to enter the United
States because of PLO terrorist activities, a move that led to the
shift of the General Assembly debate to Geneva.
   But 18 days after he denied Arafat the visa, Shultz announced
President Reagan's decision to open ``substantive dialogue'' with
the PLO, a change in U.S. foreign policy that brought exultation in
the Arab world and shock and disappointment in Israel.

<TEXT>
   Guatemalan farm workers have sent word
back home that this dusty community east of Lake Okeechobee is the
promised land, prompting a torrent of refugees that some locals want
to stop.
   ``Everyone told me there is work in the fields here every day of
the year,'' said Rafael Baltazar, 26, who arrived this month after
picking crops in California and North Carolina. ``This is where I
want to stay forever.''
   But the last thing many longtime residents of this low-income
farming community want is more Guatemalans.
   With the town's population of 5,500 already made up of nearly
3,000 Guatemalans, some residents are grumbling about the
competition for jobs, the possible drain on public services and the
feeling that ``they'' are taking over.
   ``The resentment against them is building,'' said Pete Marovich,
owner of a fertilizer business and outgoing president of the Chamber
of Commerce. ``There's simply too many here for the town to absorb.''
   Still more Guatemalans, mostly Kanjobal Indians who speak a
dialect even Spanish speakers from their own country can't
understand, flow into Indiantown to escape the violence in their
Central American homeland.
   Word of mouth and letters from relatives and friends already here
send out the message that year-round jobs providing free
transportation are plentiful for those willing to pick oranges,
grapefruits, tomatoes, cucumbers and cabbage.
   Smugglers called ``coyotes'' charge the Guatemalans upwards of
$1,000 to sneak them across the U.S. border into California, Arizona
and Texas.
   Federal officials say about 300 to 400 Guatemalans cross the
border in this way each day. The ``coyotes'' charge an additional
$500 to transport refugees to farms in Florida, most to Indiantown
and Immokalee in southwest Florida.
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, who
estimate 30,000 to 40,000 Guatemalans are in Florida, say most who
entered illegally have applied for amnesty to work in the United
States.
   New immigration policies enacted this week may slow the flood of
Central Americans into Florida. The measure would sharply limit the
number of people granted asylum. But the flood has already swamped
Indiantown.
   ``The blacks that live around here used to get all the work, but
the farms want those Guatemalans,'' said Stetson Gary, a cabbage
farm work contractor. ``Guatemalans are the hardest damn workers
I've ever seen. They're like machines.''
   Often criticized for its role in helping the Guatemalans settle
in Indiantown is Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church, which began its
efforts with the first arrivals in 1982.
   It operates a refugee school, a thrift shop and a service center
to help new arrivals complete immigration papers, learn English and
find housing.
   ``If the American people want to help them, let's help them in
their own country,'' said Lt. Floyd McAllister, ranking officer of
the Martin County sheriff's substation in Indiantown. Church
officials ``create problems by giving them legal assistance.''
   Church workers say the 30 refugees who arrive every month are
diligent, gentle people who aren't being given a chance by an
intolerant community.
   ``There has always been resistance in Indiantown. It's not a
place that adapts well to change,'' said Yolanda Martinez, a staff
member at the church service center.
   ``It was the same way when blacks came and Mexicans came,'' she
said. ``They love them out picking the oranges, but they don't like
to see them walking around the street.''
   Other church workers remember when actor Paul Newman donated a
bus for the refugee school in 1985, and days later it was pelted
with rocks by white teen-agers.
   Many of the refugee families live in an area called Blue Camp
consisting of rows of tiny shacks and one-room apartments, often
without electricity or running water.
   With no public housing in Indiantown, some landlords charge the
Guatemalans as much as $300 a month.
   The refugee area has been the site of a 20 percent increase in
police and emergency calls in the past year, county officials said.
The most serious crime came last month when a Guatemalan was
arrested in the rape of 5-year-old boy.
   ``It's usually never anything big _ lots of fights, wife beating
_ and it can normally be traced to alcohol,'' said sheriff's Deputy
Brian Roberts. ``They drink like crazy. That, more than anything,
turns people here against them.''
   At the tiny post office, where refugees send money home so family
members can make the trip, the postmaster refuses to help anyone who
can't speak English or is not accompanied by an interpreter.
   ``They're in this country now _ they should learn how to speak
the language,'' said Postmaster Ron Yates.
   Despite growing resentment among longtime residents, there have
been no formal complaints from local governments against the
Guatemalans, said INS Deputy District Director George Waldroup.
   ``I say they should all be rounded up and checked out,'' said
Marovich of the Chamber of Commerce. ``If they don't belong here,
they should be sent back to wherever they came from.''

   Supreme Court Justice William Brennan was
released from the hospital Saturday, less than a week after surgery
to remove his gall bladder, a court spokeswoman said.
   ``He actually has gone home earlier than expected,'' said court
spokeswoman Toni House.
   She said she did not know when Brennan would return to his office
at the court but added that he has been doing some work while in the
hospital.
   Brennan, 82, was taken to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in
suburban Maryland on Dec. 8 for treatment of pneumonia. Doctors
later discovered that Brennan was suffering from gall bladder
disease, which can have symptoms similar to pneumonia.
   Surgery to remove his gall bladder was performed on Monday.
   No malignancy was found in the gall bladder, Ms. House has said.
   Brennan, the court's oldest and most senior member, was last
hospitalized in August 1987 for tests on his prostate gland. The
tests at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., showed he did not have
cancer.

<HEAD>Death on a Snowy Night: Ten Years after Gacy Killings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, three days before Christmas, Dr.
Robert Stein was getting ready for bed when the phone rang. It was a
routine call for a medical examiner _ police had found two bodies.
   But there was nothing routine about the case that began unfolding
that night, when Stein was called to the home of John Wayne Gacy.
   Stein looked out a window and grimaced at the snow that was
burying Chicago, then dressed warmly for the drive to Norwood Park
Township just east of O'Hare International Airport.
   He walked into Gacy's ranch-style home and caught a whiff of
trouble.
   ``It was the odor of death,'' Stein said, recalling that two
evidence technicians had found two decaying bodies in the crawl
space.
   ``I said, `Oh brother, let's stop right here.' I was convinced
there were more bodies. Gacy later drew a diagram on a piece of
paper and showed that there were many, many bodies.''
   In the crawl space alone, 29 bodies were found. Four more were
dumped in nearby rivers.
   Ten years ago this week, Gacy _ successful building contractor,
decorated Jaycee, amateur clown, Democratic activist _ became king
of the mass murderers apprehended in this country.
   Gacy told police he strangled all but one of his 33 male victims
by wrapping rope around their necks and twisting it with a stick. He
had sex with some of them before killing them. The murders were
committed over a three-year period beginning in 1975.
   In 1980, he was convicted of 33 murders _ more than anyone before
or since.
   Gacy, 46, received death sentences for 12 of the killings and
life in prison for each of the remaining 21. In September, the
Illinois Supreme Court upheld the convictions and the sentences.
   Execution is scheduled for Jan. 11, but is almost certain to be
delayed by appeals. Illinois' last execution was in 1962.
   Today, Gacy sits in a 46-square-foot cell on death row at Menard
Correctional Center in Chester, a small town in southern Illinois.
He is allowed to exercise an hour a day and to spend another 60
minutes in the prison law library.
   ``He's not a disciplinary problem,'' says Nic Howell, spokesman
for the state Department of Corrections. ``He was painting
landscapes the last time I saw him.''
   Gacy's name surfaced briefly in this year's presidential campaign
when a pamphlet distributed by Illinois Republicans claimed that
Gacy would have been eligible for weekend passes had he committed
his crimes in Massachusetts under Gov. Michael Dukakis'
administration.
   Dukakis labeled the pamphlet ``garbage,'' and Gacy later wrote to
state GOP officials complaining about the ``sleazy'' tactic.
   At Gacy's request, corrections officials no longer relay oral
requests for interviews.
   The uneasy memories of Gacy and the crimes that stunned the world
remain close to the surface.
   ``What I especially remember was the ghoulishness of people on
the outside of the house,'' said Stein, who is still Cook County
medical examiner and owns two Gacy paintings. ``Just like counting
down the seconds in a basketball game, they were counting up the
bodies that were pulled from the ground.''
   Gacy, a Chicago native, lived in Springfield and Iowa before
returning in the early 1970s to start his own business, specializing
in remodeling work at retail stores. He often hired teen-age boys.
   Joseph Kozenczak, chief of detectives in Des Plaines who is now
police chief, had been looking for Robert Piest, a 15-year-old who
disappeared after telling his mother he was going to see Gacy about
a summer job.
   A few days later, the detective got a search warrant for Gacy's
home.
   ``We never suspected we were in the middle of mass murders _ we
were looking for one kid,'' Kozenczak said.
   Eight of the bodies were so badly decomposed they were never
identified.
   At a funeral where authorities hoped they might get clues to the
identities by watching the mourners, this was the final prayer
offered for them:
   ``Lord, you alone know the names of these brothers, names you
have written on the palm of your hand. We praise and thank you for
the gift of life you gave them. We are sorry for the violence which
took away their mortal lives.''

   A man aboard an American Airlines jet
tried to enter the cockpit and then locked himself in a bathroom
while other passengers held the door shut, officials said Saturday.
   The Boeing 727, carrying 113 passengers from Dallas-Fort Worth to
Newark, N.J., was diverted Friday night to Raleigh-Durham
International Airport, where police arrested Claude Saint-Leger,
said Teresa Damiano, airport public affairs manager.
   Saint-Leger, 54, of Los Angeles, was charged with assault on an
airport police officer and was held in the Wake County jail, Ms.
Damiano said. No federal charges have been filed yet.
   The FBI interrogated Saint-Leger and other passengers before
allowing the flight to continue to Newark, Ms. Damiano said.
   ``The passenger was not armed or dangerous in any way according
to the police report,'' Ms. Damiano said. ``He just appeared to be
disturbed.''

   Two Norwegians trawling for shrimps in the
North Sea caught a World War II German Messerschmitt ME-109 fighter
plane, the national NTB news agency reported Saturday.
   The agency, quoting a report in the daily Stavanger Aftenblad,
said the fishermen were about 340 miles south of Oslo on Thursday
when their trawl got stuck.
   ``In the trawl was a ME-109 fighter which must have rested on the
seabed for more than 40 years. The wings are hardly damaged, with
its Iron Cross marks still clearly visible. The front of the cabin
is smashed but the pilot's seat and machinegun are intact,'' the
report said.
   ME-109s were widely used by the German Luftwaffe during World War
II.

   Dennis Duke spends years nurturing firs on
his Christmas tree farm in western Kentucky. Across the river at a
factory in southern Indiana, Curtis Keen can snap out one in 10
minutes.
   They both represent rival camps in a multimillion-dollar industry
fighting to win a place in the living rooms of some 61 million
American households.
   On a cold December day, families bundle up for an outing on
Duke's farm; youngsters romp while their parents search for the
perfect tree.
   ``People like to be sure they're getting a fresh tree,'' said
Duke, who has grown trees for nine years.
   Duke's trees sell from $3 to $5 a foot. For $40, he'll dig up a
white pine and cover the roots in a burlap bag for replanting after
Christmas. He charges $10 a foot to dig spruces.
   Forty miles away in Evansville, Ind., Keen, plant manager of
Hudson Valley Tree Inc., is finished with Christmas 1988. He's
thinking about manufacturing trees for 1989.
   At Hudson Valley, no Christmas carols are played over the
loudspeaker to get workers in the holiday spirit. Keen has
considered the idea but thinks some workers might find the music
distracting.
   Besides, it's hard to hear anything above the racket of machinery
as 160 workers twist pieces of flame-retardant polyvinyl chloride _
PVC _ together with green twine, making branches that are blue,
green or a combination for spruce trees, and box them up. They also
make wreaths and garlands.
   Duke worries mostly about insects or bad weather. Keen's
challenge is getting all the right pieces in a box.
   Around the country, real trees have a slight edge over artificial
ones, according to the National Christmas Tree Association in
Milwaukee, Wis. It says 38 percent of America's households use real
trees while 33 percent prefer the artificial kind. The remaining 29
percent have no trees.
   Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states _ including Hawaii _
but the majority come from a handful of states. Michigan and Oregon
are tied for first place, each growing 6 million annually, the
association says. Other top producers are Minnesota, Wisconsin,
California and North Carolina.
   Sales of real trees are expected to generate more than $34.1
million this year, said David Baumann, executive director of the
association, which does not collect figures for artificial tree
sales.
   Sales of real trees have been healthy this season, Baumann said,
noting that growers in southern Florida are reporting increases of
15 percent to 20 percent over 1987. The number of ``choose-and-cut''
Christmas tree farms has grown from 1,000 in the 1960s to 5,000
today, he said.
   Real Christmas trees are selling for $3 to $5.25 a foot this
year, Baumann said. Artificial trees cost from $20 to $50 for
cheaper versions and from $80 to $300 for better quality ones.
   ``They won't know it's artificial unless you tell them,'' reads a
tag on a 7.5-foot, soft-needled Douglas fir at Hudson Valley that
retails for $229, comes with a 10-year guarantee and has 75
individual branches.
   A 14-foot version sells for about $999 and has 5,624 branches.
   ``I tell our people how important it is to get every branch in
the box,'' Keen said. ``If people are setting up a tree at Christmas
time and they don't have a pole or branches are missing, it's kind
of depressing to the children.''
   Hudson Valley, which has its home plant in Newburgh, N.Y., has
net sales in excess of $25 million, said Irwin Katz, vice president
of finance. People are switching to artificial trees, he said, for
safety and convenience.
   ``Tradition is an argument, but that's up to you. Real trees get
needles in your vacuum cleaner. I don't think you get them out of
the carpet until spring,'' he said. ``With ours, it folds right up,
goes into a carton and you can use it next year.''

<TEXT>
   The PLO, having made a series of
concessions to lure the United States into a dialogue, believes
Israel is now isolated and an international conference to negotiate
a comprehensive Middle East peace is on the horizon.
   ``There is an international moral force facing Israel now,''
Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said
Saturday. That moral pressure, he said, is what led the United
States to change its policy.
   The PLO's moves began last month when its parliament-in-exile,
the Palestine National Council, declared an independent Palestinian
state based on U.N. resolutions on the Mideast. PLO chief Yasser
Arafat then set about meeting all three U.S. conditions for opening
talks with the organization.
   Washington had demanded that the organization clearly recognize
Israel, renounce terrorism and accept U.N. resolutions 242 and 338,
which recognize the right of all nations in the region to live
within secure borders.
   When the United States rejected Arafat's speech to the U.N.
General Assembly on Tuesday as not clear enough, he came back a day
later with another, more explicit declaration.
   Washington then abruptly reversed its longstanding policy of
refusing to deal with the PLO and two days later opened what it
called a dialogue _ not negotiations _ with the group.
   The PLO's priority now, Arafat told reporters Saturday, is to
``push forward with the international conference to be held very
soon.''
   The change in the U.S. position caused shock in Israel. Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejects the idea of an international
conference or any talks with what it calls a ``terrorist
organization.''
   ``The PLO has opened a new era, an era of peace,'' Abdul-Rahman
said. ``The Israelis have failed to enter it. We put an agenda of
peace on the table.''
   The revival of the Middle East ``peace process,'' moribund for
the past two years, is a direct result of the yearlong ``intefadeh''
_ Arabic for uprising _ in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip that has resulted in more than 320 Palestinian deaths.
Thirteen Israelis also have died.
   More than anything else, the rock-throwing youths in the streets
of the territories and Israel's tough response has won new sympathy
for the Palestinian cause.
   As Yasser Abd-Rabbou, leader of the PLO delegation that met with
U.S. Ambassador to Tunis Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., put it: ``We are
here in the name of the intefadeh.''
   American officials in Tunis refused to make any substantive
comment about the 90-minute meeting Friday, refering all queries to
Washington. But in the Palestinian view, there is no distinction
between ``dialogue'' and ``negotiations.'' They say the talks,
whatever they are called, mean recognition of Palestinian rights.
   The only suitable framework for working out an overall Mideast
peace, the Palestinians say, is the long-discussed international
conference, involving all parties directly concerned, including the
PLO, and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   ``Our impression is that the Americans are serious, and that they
understand that this dialogue should lead to a comprehensive peace
in the Middle East,'' Abdul-Rahman said of the Tunis talks.
   Arafat said he hoped Washington now could be neutral in its peace
efforts.
   ``We started this dialogue according to their (U.S.) desire,''
the chairman said. ``We will continue with this attitude because we
know that America is one of two superpowers, and also one of five
permanent members of the Security Council. No peace can be settled
without their participation and their efforts.''
   The Palestinians say the next U.S.-PLO meeting will not take
place until after President-elect George Bush takes office Jan. 20.
Both Abdul-Rahman and Abd-Rabbou said they expected an international
peace conference to get under way ``soon,'' though neither said when.
   The PLO's acceptance of U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 in
Abdul-Rahman's words, ''the passport to the international
conference.''
   The PLO now has the official ear of Washington, and is counting
on Washington to get the attention of Israel.
   ``The decision for war or peace in the Middle East is made in
Washington, not in Tel Aviv,'' Abdul-Rahman said.

<HEAD>Reagan To Focus On Budget After Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan pledged today to work on
reforming the nation's budget process after leaving office, calling
the effort a ``vital campaign.''
   ``The budget system simply has no control and no internal
discipline. And that's the problem,'' Reagan said in his weekly
radio address, delivered from the Oval Office.
   With less than five weeks left in his presidency, Reagan used his
five-minute address to argue once again that the president needs
greater authority to limit spending in order to curtail the
country's deficit.
   In the 1988 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, a $155.1 billion
deficit was recorded. Under the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law, a
$100 billion deficit target has been set for the 1990 fiscal year.
   Reagan blamed Congress for getting the nation into its red ink
dilemma, saying, ``Every dime of deficit spending has been mandated
by Congress.''
   Emphasizing that he believes the deficit can be solved without
raising taxes, Reagan also said such spending woes could be avoided
if a laundry list of changes in the budget process were enacted.
   The president has argued repeatedly during his White House tenure
for the proposals, such as the presidential authority to veto
individual items in appropriations bills, a constitutional amendment
requiring a balanced budget, and granting the president authority
not to spend money that Congress has appropriated, among others.
   ``Congress must reform its faulty budget process and we need a
balanced budget amendment to the Constitution so that the federal
government does not spend more than it takes in,'' Reagan said.
   ``After I leave office next month, I will campaign for these
reforms. So today, I'm asking you to join me in this vital campaign
for the future by making your voice heard. If we achieve these
reforms, the deficit will be ancient history in no time,'' Reagan
said.
   Reagan is required under the law to submit another budget on Jan.
9, and it is expected that he will include his budget reform
recommendations in that spending plan.
   President-elect George Bush has the option of scrapping Reagan's
entire budget if he wants and submitting his won proposal after he
takes office Jan. 20.
   Bush has declined to say whether he will submit his own plan, but
has said he wants to open negotiations with Congress over ways to
reduce the deficit.

<TEXT>
   KHAO-I-DANG, Thailand (AP) _ Cambodian refugees who lost their
limbs in a decade of war against Vietnam competed in a special
athletic competition on Saturday, pushing themselves to the limit on
crutches and wheelchairs.
   A young man with a wooden right leg jogged into a soccer field
with a torch to inaugurate the event at this refugee camp, where 55
disabled veterans competed in 11 sports. Most are the victims of
landmines strewn over vast areas of embattled Cambodia.
   Several thousand refugees watched the games, standing or sitting
in the dirt of this camp of bamboo and thatch-roof huts at the base
of a mountain in the eastern province of Prachinburi.
   For the second straight year, Suk Sam, 22, won the dash on
crutches, leaving his closest competitor far behind on the
dirt-swept field. The guerrilla soldier lost his leg in 1986, when a
mine exploded as he was fighting Vietnamese troops that invaded
Cambodia in 1978.
   ``Sports keep you healthy, and I participated for the honor of my
camp,'' said the mild-mannered young man. ``I felt very sorry about
losing my leg, but I realized that many other people lost their
limbs too, and I was doing my duty to my country.''
   Suk Sam said that after he lost his leg, fighting prevented him
from being evacuated from the front for six months.
   Ching Pan, 29, who won the wheelchair race, lost both legs to a
landmine in a fierce 1982 battle for Pnom Malai, opposite the
central Thai border.
   ``I thought I would be No. 1 in a wheelchair, and I wanted to
find out if I would succeed,'' said Ching Pan.
   Prizes for the winners included scarves, T-shirts, books, sweets
and other items donated by foreign relief workers.
   The fourth annual competition was organized by Operation Handicap
International, the French-based agency that sponsors rehabilitation
services for thousands of handicapped refugee in camps along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
   The athletes competing Saturday were brought to Khao-I-Dang from
other U.N.-aided refugee camps.
   Khao-I-Dang is neutral, but the other camps are controlled by
Cambodian guerrillas, including the communist Khmer Rouge, the
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front and the
forces of Cambodia's former leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The Khmer Rouge allowed athletes to leave only its Site 8 camp,
which is U.N.-sponsored. Aid officials say the Khmer Rouge, who
killed hundreds of thousands when they led Cambodia in 1975-78, are
holding refugees as virtual captives in their three other camps.
   Vietnam, which has promised to withdraw its 120,000 troops by
1990, is supporting the Cambodian government against the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge and other rebels.
   ``(The guerrillas) are all separated for political reasons, but
some of the refugees don't care about these differences,'' said
Myriam Houtart, a Belgian medical coordinator for Operation Handicap
and an Olympics organizer. ``All these people are within the same
walls here and there is no fighting. They just enjoy the games.''
   Houtart said the handicapped tend to be separated from the other
refugees. She said some camp administrators give the amputees
special food and other items, but ``after that, they don't want to
hear about them any more.''

   For James Brown, the Godfather of Soul, Soul
Brother No. 1, the self-proclaimed Pope of Music, it has finally
come to this: six years in a South Carolina prison for trying to run
over two policemen.
   Just two years after a comeback run, Brown's life is a mess. The
man praised by presidents for his good works cannot stay out of
trouble. The singer of love ballads was charged this year with
trying to kill his wife; it's his third tumultuous marriage. The
crusader against drugs apparently has a PCP habit.
   ``Obviously, there is trouble within the confines of James Brown,
the man,'' his attorney, Albert ``Buddy'' Dallas, said last week.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Robert ``Flash'' Gordon of Augusta,
who worked for the singer-businessman's three radio stations in the
1970s, before Brown lost the stations and much of what he owned in
tax and other money troubles.
   ``I can't imagine anything like this happening to him,'' Gordon
said Friday from Augusta, the day his friend checked into prison.
   Brown, 55, has shown little sign of slowing down, either on or
off the stage. He still performs around the world. He still makes
records.
   Brown was arrested at least seven times in the past year and a
half, including twice in a bizarre 20 hours in September that
culminated in Thursday's sentence in Aiken, S.C.
   On Sept. 24, Brown led police on a two-state chase until they
shot out his tires. According to blood tests, he was strung out on
PCP, a hallucinogen known as ``angel dust.'' After posting bond, he
was arrested for drunken driving.
   His trial in Georgia on 10 misdemeanors stemming from the chase
is scheduled for Jan. 23.
   ``This is not the real James Brown,'' said Dallas, his attorney
of four years. Brown's problems, he said, ``originated during a time
of domestic difficulties'' with his wife, Adrienne. ``He just can't
get it to smooth out.''
   ``I programmed three radio stations for him,'' Gordon recalled.
``He didn't allow anything like that. If you even had any alcohol or
anything like that, you lost your job. I don't know what has
happened to him.''
   Long-time employee Fred Daviss saw him in September. ``He had
passed the point of no return,'' Daviss said. ``He had trouble
speaking. His wife was hiding the car keys from him. I pleaded with
her to get him some help.''
   In the past, Brown made it on his own. Jailed for auto theft at
15, the former shoeshine boy got out and formed a singing group that
became his Famous Flames. In 1956, he released ``Please, Please,
Please.'' James Brown was on his way.
   A string of hits _ ``I Got You (I Feel Good),'' ``Papa's Got A
Brand New Bag,'' ``Cold Sweat'' _ defined 1960s soul music. With
frenetic, repeating guitar rhythms, bullet-sharp horn blasts and
Brown's inimitable yowls and growls, nothing before _ or since _
sounded like it. With his sweat, his jet-black pompadour and his
constant shuffling, leg-splitting dancing, nobody looked like James
Brown, either.
   Brown took a step toward the political with songs such as ``Say
It Loud _ I'm Black And I'm Proud,'' and his influence was large.
His TV appearances following the assassination of Martin Luther King
Jr. were credited by President Johnson with helping avoid further
violence. He urged kids not to get messed up in drugs.
   Brown later tried to ride the disco tide, with only partial
success. Financial problems followed. The IRS says he still owes $6
million.
   But the late '80s brought nostalgia for Brown's music. And unlike
many rock legends, the Godfather of Soul was still out there
working. His ``Living In America,'' from the film ``Rocky IV,'' won
a Grammy in 1987, his second.
   But 1987 also saw Brown's life beginning to crack. He was getting
arrested, for driving violations, assaulting police, drugs. Before,
he had gotten probation and fines. Not this time in the South
Carolina courtroom.
   ``I don't want to take too much of your time, sir,'' Brown told
Aiken County Judge Hubert Long last week. ``But I'm fighting for my
life.
   ``James Brown, the man, wants to do right,'' he continued. ``I've
wanted to do right all my life. I'll do anything I can not to go to
prison, so I can continue my work.''
   ``I've considered that you've done a lot of good,'' the judge
said. ``But I've got to consider some of the bad.''
   Brown will be eligible for parole in 18 months _ earlier, if he
behaves himself.
   ``James Brown is a survivor,'' Dallas said. ``We have not even
touched the depths of James Brown yet. This is a setback. It is not
the end. I don't think people want it to be the end.''

   President Reagan contended Saturday that the
nation's deficit could be ``ancient history in no time'' if the
president had more power over the budget process.
   Reagan, who leaves office in less than five weeks, used his
weekly radio address to blame Congress once again for the nation's
deficit spending habits.
   ``Every dime of deficit spending has been mandated by Congress,''
Reagan said in the address, delivered from the Oval Office.
   ``Under the Constitution, only Congress can spend money; the
president can't appropriate a penney,'' Reagan said.
   In the 1988 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the nation
recorded a $155.1 billion deficit. Under the Gramm-Rudman budget
balancing law, a $100 billion deficit target has been set for the
1990 fiscal year.
   ``The verdict is in. The current system does not work,'' Reagan
said.
   Reagan did not mention his successor, President-elect Bush, but
he did argue that the nation's red ink woes can be solved without
raising taxes, a pledge Bush made in his campaign.
   Reagan is required under the law to submit another budget on Jan.
9, and it is expected that he will include many of his budget reform
recommendations in that spending plan.
   Saying, ``The only way to reduce the deficit is by limiting the
increases in spending,'' Reagan said his final budget will reduce
the deficit target by some $35 billion for the 1990 fiscal year and
meet the Gramm-Rudman target.
   The president also contended that his budget plan will do so
``without touching Social Security or raising taxes.''
   ``Economic growth will increase revenues by $80 billion without
new taxes. Just by holding spending increases to less than $80
billion, we will reduce the deficit and put ourselves on track for a
balanced budget by 1993,'' Reagan said.
   Bush has the option of scrapping Reagan's entire budget if he
wants and submitting his won proposal after he takes office Jan. 20.
   Bush has declined to say whether he will submit his own plan, but
has said he wants to open negotiations with Congress over ways to
reduce the deficit.
   As he has many times in during his two terms, Reagan used his
five-minute address to argue for an array of changes in the budget
process. Many of them grant more power to the president rather to
Congress and have therefore met stiff opposition on Capitol Hill.
   They include presidential authority to veto individual items in
appropriations bills, a constitutional amendment requiring a
balanced budget, and granting the president authority not to spend
money that Congress has appropriated, among others.
   ``Congress must reform its faulty budget process and we need a
balanced budget amendment to the Constitution so that the federal
government does not spend more than it takes in,'' Reagan said.
   ``After I leave office next month, I will campaign for these
reforms. So today, I'm asking you to join me in this vital campaign
for the future by making your voice heard. If we achieve these
reforms, the deficit will be ancient history in no time,'' Reagan
said.

   A tiger mauled a handler at Sydney's
Taronga Park Zoo on Saturday, leaving her in critical condition.
   Victoria Scrivener, 33, was rushed to the hospital with severe
injuries to her head and upper body after being attacked when she
apparently tried to separate the female Sumatran tiger from her cubs.
   A spokesman for the zoo, who declined to be identified, said the
zoo was investigating the incident.
   Dr. James Rogers, acting medical superintendent for the Royal
North Shore Hospital, said Ms. Scrivener was in critical condition
Saturday night.
   A colleague who entered the tiger cage with her was not hurt,
according to the zoo spokesman. He refused to comment further and
said the findings of the inquiry would not be available for some
time.

   No, I'm not asking you to pay more taxes. I think you already pay
plenty, and those trying to tax away more of your hard-earned money
should be ashamed of themselves. Instead what I need is for you to
help me fix a budget system that has broken down.
   First let me describe the problem, and then I'll tell you what we
can do about it. The record is not good. In all but eight of the
last 56 years the federal government has run a deficit, and every
dime of deficit spending over these many years has been mandated by
Congress.
   You see, under the Constitution, only Congress can spend money.
The president can't appropriate a penny.
   Up until 1974, the president did have one effective way to
control spending. He could refuse to spend money appropriated by
Congress and this ability to impound funds was routinely used by
such presidents as Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt.
   In fact three of my predecessors _ Presidents Kennedy, Johnson
and Nixon _ used this power each year to reduce federal spending by
between five and eight percent. During my presidency, that would
have reduced the deficit by billions each year.
   But all that changed in 1974. In the 1974 Budget and Impoundment
Control Act, Congress stripped the President of his ability to
refuse to spend funds. Let me try to describe the effect of this
change. Suppose the rules of hockey were changed and the goalie was
removed from the game. Would you be surprised if hockey scores
quadrupled?
   Well since Congress changed the budget law, federal spending has
in fact quadrupled and it has come right out of your pocket.
   And under the new rules the deficit has taken off. For a quarter
century, the average annual federal deficit was just seven-tenths of
one percent of Gross National Product.
   Then in the mid-1970s Congress changed the rules and since then
the deficit has been running five times higher than before. The
verdict is in. The current system does not work.
   Can you imagine if a head of a household or a business were
forced to spend every dime that was budgeted even if savings were
available?
   Well that's the situation the president is in now. All he can do
is ask Congress to take back funds it appropriated. Since 1982, I
have requested Congress to take back unneeded funds more than 460
times and 83 percent of the time they refused.
   Most of the time they didn't even bring it up for a vote. They
simply said, ``No, spend it all.''
   During my two terms, Congress appropriated over $100 billion more
on domestic spending than I requested. But this is typical.
   Between 1976 and 1987, a period spanning three presidents in
which we ran a deficit each year, Congress spent an average of $30
billion per year more than the president requested.
   The budget system simply has no control and no internal
discipline, and that's the problem. Now here's what must be done.
   To solve the deficit problem it is essential that we restore the
constitutional balance and repair the system. We need to give the
president greater authority to limit spending; that means the
line-item veto which 43 governors have, and also greater authority
for a president to return unneeded funds to Congress.
   Congress must reform its faulty budget process, and we need a
balanced budget amendment to the Constitution so the federal
government does not spending more than it takes in.
   After I leave office next month I will campaign for these
reforms. So today, I'm asking you to join me in this vital campaign
for the future by making your voice heard. If we achieve these
reforms, then a deficit will be ancient history in no time.
   What won't solve the problem is raising taxes. In fact, over the
last 40 years the record is this; on average, every $100 of new
taxes has led to $158 of new spending. And since 1981, yearly tax
revenues have gone up sharply by some $375 billion, but that hasn't
balanced the budget because spending has gone up $450 billion, and
less than one-third of that went for defense.
   Yes we've heard a lot about cuts, but by there terms, even when
spending goes up they call it a cut. For example Medicare spending,
which we've been charged with cutting, in fact has doubled.
   The only way to reduce the deficit is by limiting the increase in
spending, and that's what my last budget will do. Without touching
Social Security or raising taxes, our fiscal year 1990 budget will
reduce the deficit by some $35 billion _ more than meeting the
Gramm-Rudman target.
   You see, economic growth will increase revenues by $80 billion
without new taxes. Just by holding spending increases to less than
$80 billion we will reduce the deficit and put ourselves on track
for a balanced budget by 1993 and with your help that will be done.
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

   George Bush has five weeks to go until he
assumes command, but his offhand remarks and news-conference
performances are providing an early glimpse into the policies and
style he is likely to pursue as chief executive.
   Bush has backed off one campaign pledge completely: his promise
to name Vice President-elect Dan Quayle to head the nation's drug
enforcement effort.
   And he has modified other campaign positions in light of changing
political realities, such as his vow to not deal with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   In the area of relations with the Soviets, Bush has displayed
more caution than was evident in his campaign utterances, urging a
go-slow approach both toward a summit with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev and to new talks to cut strategic arms.
   And on the federal budget, Bush has been shifting his stance:
first hinting that he would not submit his own budget this winter,
then saying that he recognized he must take the initiative.
   In areas of style, Bush has displayed a certain zest in his
frequent encounters with reporters and has suggested he will hold
more frequent news conferences than President Reagan.
   But he also issued a warning: no more answering of shouted
questions at photo-taking sessions once he takes office _ a tactic
that had become a standard practice of reporters covering the Reagan
White House.
   Meanwhile, the vice president has been meeting with scores of
individuals and organization in an effort to reach out to friend and
former foe alike, including meetings defeated rival Michael Dukakis,
Democrat Jesse Jackson and the Coretta Scott King, the widow of
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   During his campaign, Bush said he hoped to have a summit with
Gorbachev as soon as possible after he takes office.
   However, on Friday, answering questions after announcing his
selection of former Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, Bush said
``there is no expectation that we will or won't'' have such an early
session _ saying he didn't want to send the wrong signal and appear
over hasty.
   A few days earlier, Bush said he plans to move slowly in arms
talks with the Soviets and said ``there is no way'' his
administration would have a detailed program on arms talks by a
scheduled Feb. 5 date for the resumption of talks.
   ``It will be a different kind of White House. It's going to be
brimming with kids, a very uplifting kind of family setting. In
terms of style, I think George Bush is going to be closer to John
Kennedy than Ronald Reagan,'' said Iowa Rep. Jim Leach, a moderate
Republican.
   ``He's going to be very hands-on and involved. Capitol Hill has
been increasingly frustrated in dealing with a disengaged president.
I think the Bush administration will have a very positive
attitude,'' Leach continued.
   But Norman Ornstein, a political analyst for the conservative
American Enterprise Institute, said Bush ``is trying to balance and
juggle in the transition, as he did in the campaign, two very
different personalities.''
   ``One is the tough, hard-nosed, `read my lips, make my day'
George Bush. That's the George Bush who basically says, we've got to
take it easy with the Soviets. We're not going to rush to judgement
on a (strategic arms limitation treaty) with the Soviets,'' Ornstein
said.
   ``The other is the kinder and gentler, thousand points of light,
to reach out to Congress, to Jesse Jackson, to various groups George
Bush, the one who writes who writes little notes to everybody.
   ``He's managed to juggle the two personalities very adroitly. But
I`m not sure it's going to be as easy to do once he's inaugurated,''
Ornstein added.
   After vowing repeatedly to make his vice president a drug czar in
his administration, Bush in recent days has suggested he won't,
saying to do so would ``circumvent a law'' passed by Congress that
requires him to name someone other than the vice president to such a
post.
   On the subject of one of Reagan's pet projects, the ``Star Wars''
Strategic Defense Initiative, Bush has reiterated his support for
the program to shield the nation against incoming nuclear missiles.
   But, just as in the campaign, there was still some ambivalence to
the vice president's commitment to the plan _ heightened by comments
by Tower on Friday suggesting SDI's usefulness as a bargaining
``lever'' in dealing with the Soviets.
   Bush has voiced support for the Reagan administration decision to
open talks with PLO chief Yasser Arafat _ a decision that spares him
from having to make the tough call but means the talks will proceed
on his watch.
   At the same time, he has indicated skepticism and caution,
telling reporters, ``I honestly don't know where it will lead.''
   ``I wouldn't overstate the importance of this in terms of the
formulation of our own Middle East policy,'' Bush said last week.
   But, asked whether he would pursue a campaign demand that the PLO
change its covenant to eliminate language supporting the destruction
of Israel, Bush indicated he would not. ``I don't want to set the
clock back,'' he said.
   On other issues, Bush continues to decline to spell out where he
would make cuts to trim the federal budget deficit, brushing aside
specific questions on what he would do for the homeless and how he
would pay for refurbishing antiquated nuclear weapons plants.
   On farm programs, Bush declared ``I don't believe we are going to
balance the budget eventually on the backs of the farmers,'' but
went on to say he favored allowing ``more market forces that lead to
lower supports and lower subsidies.''
   On trade issues, Bush indicated that he would continue recent
Reagan administration policy of firing ``rifle shot'' trade
sanctions at economic allies that discriminate against U.S. goods to
``show our determination to have fair trade and equal access.''

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address:
   My fellow Americans, today I want to ask you a question. Will you
help me to reduce the federal budget deficit and then balance the
budget once and for all?
   No, I'm not asking you to pay more taxes. I think you already pay
plenty, and those trying to tax away more of your hard-earned money
should be ashamed of themselves. Instead what I need is for you to

   Thousands of buzzards have come back
to winter in South Florida, but some people complain that the ugly
birds with a wingspan of up to 6 feet have returned in unprecedented
numbers.
   ``We joke and say, `The birds are coming, the birds are coming,'
'' said George Gerber, a resident of the Township condominium
complex.
   But he says the birds are no longer a joke because they have come
in such numbers. They dine at dumps, soar over parks, congregate at
high-rises and even visit some of the mansions in tony Palm Beach.
   ``When they fly, they look like something out of Hitchcock,''
said Doris Howard, another Township resident.
   ``They're taking over,'' said Mildred Nierenberg, president of
the Township's Applewood Village I condominium association. ``It's
frightening,'' she said, despite reassurances that vultures are
considered harmless. They are known to eat only garbage and the
flesh of dead creatures.
   The condo's proximity to a landfill near Pompano Beach may be its
attraction.
   ``We can hear them bouncing around on the roof at night,'' said
Fay Sackman, who lives on the top floor of a Township building.
``Sometimes they go at each other. That's making love, I guess.''
   ``We love Mother Nature, but this is too much,'' said Phil
Pincus, another Township resident.
   ``They sit and preen their feathers,'' said Jim Roth, a spokesman
for the state Solid Waste Authority, which operates the landfill
near Riviera Beach. ``There are hundreds of them here. They hang out
and pick through the garbage.''
   Shooting the birds is out because the destruction of wildlife and
migratory birds is against federal and state laws.
   Pincus built a fashionable scarecrow on the lawn near his
building.
   ``I built a scarecrow in Christian Dior clothes,'' said the
retired Dior distribution manager.
   The creation worked on some of the buzzards, but Pincus says when
a maintenance worker knocked it down by accident, the birds attacked
and tore it apart.
   ``I guess they thought it had died,'' Pincus said. ``This time
I'm going to build one and dress it in Levis.''
   But Ron Broman, president of the Broward Audubon Society, notes
the winter residents play a vital environmental role as ``masters of
recycling.''

   Sinhalese militants, accused of killing
more than 430 people in the past month, set fire to a bus Saturday
and threw a firebomb at a shop in attempts to spread terror two days
before presidential elections, police and witnesses said.
   Three people were injured in the bomb attack, witnesses said on
conditon of anonymity.
   Also Saturday, security forces shot and killed a suspected
Sinhalese radical and the bodies of four other suspected radicals
were found in the last 24 hours, officials said.
   There was no word on who killed the four.
   No one was hurt in the bus fire in the center of Colombo, but the
flames engulfed three nearby shops, a police official said. He also
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Witnesses said a gang of militants entered the parked bus,
sprinkled gasoline and set it on fire.
   Sinhalese militants also hurled a firebomb at a shop opposite the
city's main train station, other witnesses said. At least three
people were injured in the attack, they said.
   The attacks prompted authorities to move up a night curfew on the
island by one hour. The curfew now is to start at 8 p.m. Saturday
and end at 5 a.m. Sunday.
   Officials say Sinhalese militants have killed more than 430
people since Nov. 16 in an attempt to disrupt Monday's balloting.
   Cabinet minister Vincent Perera told Parliament that 405 people
were killed by the militants between Nov. 16 and Thursday in
Sinhalese-dominated central and southern Sri Lanka. The 168-member
Parliament then voted 65-2 to extend emergency laws in effect since
1983.
   At least 26 people were killed by the militants since Thursday,
military officials said on condition of anonymity.
   The killings are a part of a campaign of violence aimed at
disrupting presidential elections scheduled for Monday. The People's
Liberation Front, the main militant Sinhalese group, has called for
a boycott of the polls, claiming they will not be conducted fairly.
   The group, which has called for the dismissal of the government
and organized a series of crippling strikes, says the government
gave too many concessions in a July 1987 peace accord aimed at
ending the 5-year-old insurrection by guerrillas of the minority
Tamil community.
   Members of the front have been blamed for bomb attacks on
meetings of opposition presidential candidates Sirimavo Bandaranaike
and Ossie Abeygoonasekara.
   Two bombs exploded at a public meeting Friday addressed by Mrs.
Bandaranaike, a former prime minister and leader of the Sri Lanka
Freedom Party. She was unhurt.
   Abeygoonasekara, who represents the United Socialist Alliance
composed of four leftist parties, has survived three assassination
attempts since he announced his candidacy last month.
   The polls will elect a successor to President Junius R.
Jayewardene, who by law cannot be elected to a third term. His
United National Party has put up Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa
to replace Jayewardene.
   Sinhalese form 75 percent of the island's 16 million people.
Tamils make up 18 percent of the population.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting since 1983 for an independent
homeland on the island's north and east, claiming discrimination by
the Sinhalese in jobs and education.
   At least 8,500 people have died in the separatist war.

<DATELINE>TANGALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every morning, when people return to
the streets of this town after a dusk-to-dawn curfew, the talk is of
bodies: how many were found, whether the victims' names are known,
how they died.
   Like the rest of the population of this tropical island once
known as an ideal of democracy, Tangalle's residents are to vote
Monday for a new president. Although voting is only hours away, they
speak not of ballots but of bullets, charred bodies and people who
disappear in the night.
   ``Have you seen the body at Katuwana village?'' asked Gamini
Dissanayake. ``It is almost burnt beyond recognition.''
   Bodies of young Sinhalese men have been found almost every day
for the last two weeks, according to the people of Tangalle and
other towns along the south coast.
   Anula Gamage, a 26-year-old mother of three in Tangalle, often
slips out of her house at night to see whether more bodies have been
dumped by the roadside _and whether her husband is among the
victims. She said he was taken away on Nov. 12 by armed men in
civilian clothing.
   Villagers blame government troops for the killings. They accuse
the troops of rounding up people suspected of belonging to the
People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese radical group that has vowed
to disrupt the elections and kill anyone who supports a government
peace plan for ending a 5-year-old insurrection by members of the
Tamil minority.
   Military officials deny the allegations. They say the killings
are spontaneous civilian retaliations against the front, which the
government blames for the deaths of more than 600 people since the
peace accord was signed July 29, 1987.
   The front has accused President Junius R. Jayewardene of selling
out his own Sinhalese community, which comprises 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, in attempts to make peace with the
Tamils, who account for 18 percent of the population.
   Jayewardene, barred by the constitution from seeking a third
term, has fielded his prime minister, Ransinghe Premedasa, to
represent his United National Party.
   Extremists have killed members of the incumbent party, as well as
supporters of the other two major candidates, former Prime Minister
Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Ossie
Abeygoonesekera of the United Socialist Alliance. On Friday, a bomb
went off at Bandaranaike's final campaign rally, injuring three
people.
   No one knows for sure how many people have disappeared or been
killed for their suspected links with the People's Liberation Front.
But conversations with villagers indicate scores have died.
   Military officials in Colombo said Friday that the bodies of
eight suspected front members had been found in the last 24 hours in
the Sinhalese heartland. They blamed the killings on the People's
Revolutionary Red Army, a group unheard of a few weeks ago.
   ``There were 62 bodies in Southern province in the last three
days,'' said Mahinda Rajapakse, a lawyer in Tangalle, 90 miles
southeast of Colombo. ``Some of them were burned with tires to
prevent identification.''
   Rajapakse's home is a magnet for those whose sons and husbands
have vanished. He said he does not know how many are missing but
said they number in ``the hundreds, maybe thousands.''
   ``The men came in vehicles without license plates and took away
my son, Amirth Nandasena,'' his mother wailed, sitting on the ground
in her mud hut in Tangalle. She said Amirth was found later shot to
death, his body dumped along the road a mile from her hut.
   Brig. Lakshman Algama, military coordination officer for Southern
province which includes Tangalle, denied security forces were
responsible for the charred bodies.
   ``This is a new trend of revenge killings by relatives and
friends who were earlier killed or harassed by the extremists,'' he
said in an interview in Galle, 40 miles west of Tangalle.
   An emergency government decree Nov. 9 gave the army the power to
shoot on sight anyone demonstrating against the government or
instigating strikes. Security forces subsequently were empowered to
bury bodies without waiting for inquests.
   Government forces acknowledge they round up suspected radicals.
Algama said 1,235 Sinhalese men were detained at Boosa prison near
Galle.
   ``They have been apprehended in various police areas in the south
and are sent here to go through a process of being screened, and
then the innocents are released,'' Algama said.
   He claimed the security forces' actions would allow the country
to choose a new president.
   ``We have created a climate for elections to be held,'' he said.

<HEAD>Papandreou Says He'll Resign if Parliament Rejects Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHIL DOPOULOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou, whose socialist
administration has been rocked by a financial scandal, said Saturday
the government will resign if Parliament does not approve his 1989
budget.
   The 69-year-old premier told a nationwide television audience
that he would consider a rejection of the nearly $28 billion budget
a no-confidence vote in his socialist government.
   ``If not approved, the government will resign with all the
consequences that would follow such an action'', he said. If the
government resigns because of failure to win a majority in the vote
scheduled for Sunday, general elections must be held within 45 days.
   Papandreou's speech came as rumors circulated through the Greek
capital that the government was about to collapse because of a
widening financial scandal.
   The scandal broke in October when opposition parties charged
senior government officials of involvement in illegal deals
allegedly set up by banker George Koskotas, who is accused of
influence peddling, embezzlement and fraud.
   The deals allegedly involved _ directly or indirectly _ the prime
minister and members of the governing Panhellenic Socialist
Movement, including Papandreou's son, George, who is Minister of
Education.
   Seven ministers have left the 59-member Cabinet as a result of
the $300 million banking and arms scandal. Koskotas, the former
chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled Greece Nov. 6 and has been
arrested in the United States.
   Koskotas, who ran a house-painting business in New York from 1974
to 1979, is also charged with attempting to defraud the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service. A hearing is scheduled in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan on Jan. 9.
   On Wednesday, Deputy Defense Minister Stathis Yiotas resigned,
saying: ``I refuse as a member of this government to be associated
with adventurers, swindlers and embezzlers of public money.''
   Yiotas charged the directors of the Greek Arms Industry of paying
commissions of millions of dollars for unfulfilled contracts to arms
dealers hiding behind dummy companies.
   He also resigned his seat in Parliament and left the governing
party's central committee.
   The scandal widened when a banking commissioner investigating the
Bank of Crete said public service organizations had more than $133
million on deposit with the bank.
   
   Greek newspapers and opposition political parties accused
officials working for the post office, telephone company and other
public services of receiving interest rates above the legal limit
from the bank and pocketing the difference.
   
   In his speech, Papandreou charged ``domestic and foreign
circles'' of ``undermining and orchestrating'' the overthrow of his
socialist administration, basing ``their hopes in God that I would
not return from London.'' He did not elaborate. Papandreou underwent
bypass cardiac surgery there on September 30.
   Political observers said Papandreou's speech appeared to be a
warning to his deputies to adhere to the party line or _ if they
failed to approve the government's budget _ be considered defectors.
According to parliamentary procedure, lawmakers cast ballots by
voice vote and therefore are hesitant to oppose party policy.
   His party controls 157 seats in the 300-member single-chamber
Parliament, the conservative New Democracy party has 112 seats, the
Communist Party 12, and other parties, 19.
   Debate on the budget began Thursday and a vote is scheduled for
Sunday.
   New Democracy, led by Constantine Mitsotakis, has called on the
government to resign and call elections.

<HEAD>Local Governments Soften Blow Of Having A Girl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local governments in China, faced with growing
peasant resistance to the one-child policy, are trying to soften the
blow to families whose one child turns out to be a girl.
   A county in southeastern China's Jiangxi province has set up an
old-age insurance program for couples that have a girl and then
agree to be sterilized, the official People's Daily said Friday.
   Another county in Guangdong province has set up a similar program
with the local government and parents of girls jointly contributing
to a pension fund, the paper said Monday.
   China, seeking to control a population that already exceeds 1.08
billion, has mandated that most families can have only one child.
But peasant families want boys to help in the fields and support
them in their old age. For centuries girls have been regarded as a
burden because once they become old enough to make money they marry
into another family.
   As China's economic reforms have made peasants wealthier, more
and more are willing to pay fines and have a second or third child
if the first ones turn out to be girls. China also has acknowledged
a growing problem of girl babies being aborted, killed at birth or
abandoned, creating a sex ratio imbalance.
   The People's Daily said the new old-age insurance plans are
designed to overcome the disadvantages of having a girl.
   In the Jiangxi case, local governments and industries have
donated to a fund that will be invested, and parents of girls who
are sterilized can receive payments after they reach age 55.
   In Guangdong, families can draw on the pension fund after 25
years.
   Women are under strong pressure from their husbands and in-laws
to have sons. The official China Daily recently reported the case of
a young woman in Beijing whose in-laws threw her out of the house
because she had a girl.
   A survey of nearly 300 rural families in central China's Henan
province found that more girls than boys were born from 1977 to
1984, but that since 1984 the number of surviving boys babies has
been nearly twice the number of girls. An official report on the
survey said the mortality rate for baby girls was higher among the
surveyed families than that for boys.
   In one effort to cope with the problem, China's family planning
officials said in August they were beginning to allow peasant
families whose first child was a girl to have a second one.
   However, local family planning officials remain under pressure
from Beijing to meet birth control quotas. The pension plans appear
to be another approach to the problem.

<HEAD>Judge Changes Mind Minutes Before Sentencing In Murder Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recasts lede to change to rarely used sted obscure, SUBS 6th
graf, ``Judge Carey ...' to clarify definition of recuse.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge, citing a rarely used rule, disqualified
himself from a murder case only minutes before he was expected to
issue a 50-year sentence.
   As a result of Cook County Circuit Judge Philip Carey's action,
attorneys said Friday the case against defendant Lorraine Williams
must start over, and she may have to face trial and even a possible
death sentence.
   Ms. Williams, 27, is charged with the stabbing and beating death
of the night manager of a suburban motel where she worked as a maid.
   Carey had indicated at a pre-trial hearing with attorneys for
both sides that he would sentence Ms. Williams to 50 years in prison
in exchange for a guilty plea, Assistant State's Attorney James M.
Reilly said.
   Reilly said that during the course of the plea Thursday, Carey
believed he heard some additional information about the crime and
felt it might merit a stiffer sentence.
   ``Judge Carey recused himself ... and (the case) was reassigned''
to another judge,'' the prosecutor said. ``Recuse'' is a legal term
meaning to withdraw because a judge or juror is prejudiced or
otherwise incompetent to act.
   ``It's very unusual for this to happen. But the rules provide
that this is how it's done,'' said defense attorney Marvin Leavitt.
   Under the agreement reached at the pre-trial conference, Leavitt
said, his client escaped a trial and a possible death penalty had
she been convicted.
   In disqualifying himself, however, Carey also vacated Ms.
Williams' guilty plea, so the case essentially will start from
scratch, Leavitt said.
   Both attorneys said they thought the details described in court
Thursday were virtually the same as those told to the judge
previously.
   Carey declined to specify what made him change his mind.
   Leavitt said he is not bitter, even though the judge's action
means his client could now face a trial.
   ``He's a conscientious and thoughtful kind of a judge,'' and felt
he had no choice but to disqualify himself, Leavitt said. ``He
followed the rules, if he's second-guessing himself on what he was
going to do.''
   Ms. Williams is charged with murder, armed robbery and arson in
the Feb. 15 death of Jane Youngjohns, 61. Ms. Williams is accused of
using a rock, knife, and a heavy metal dustpan to kill Ms.
Youngjohns in her motel office. Prosecutors say she then set the
body on fire.
   A Jan. 4 hearing is scheduled, but Leavitt said he hopes an
agreement can be reached with the new judge that will enable his
client to avoid a trial.

   One of Hawaii's richest snowbirds has received
state permission to bring two pet camels to winter in paradise.
   Reclusive tobacco heiress Doris Duke and her newly adopted
daughter want to ship Princess and Baby, 1-year-old female Bactrian
camels, from Ms. Duke's New Jersey estate to her 4.9-acre beachfront
estate in the posh Honolulu neighborhood of Black Point, attorney
Ronald Y.K. Leong told the state Board of Agriculture on Friday.
   Ms. Duke and adopted daughter Charlene Gail ``Chandi'' Heffner,
35, spend late November to early April in the islands, Leong said.
   The panel unanimously approved the request to allow Princess and
Baby to join Ms. Duke and Heffner. Friday's hearing was necessary to
comply with Hawaii's stringent laws governing the importation of
animals.
   Leong said Princess and Baby live inside Ms. Duke's New Jersey
mansion. He did not know whether the animals would live inside or
outside of Ms. Duke's Honolulu home.

grants wishes for children with life-threatening illnesses.
   A silent auction was held Friday at a downtown office building,
the California Plaza. The celebrities donated Christmas stockings
that they decorated themselves, said Lynn Feldman, a publicist for
the affair.
   ``It was surprising,'' she said. ``People bid the highest amounts
of money for some of the older celebrities.''
   Jimmy Stewart's stocking got the biggest draw, at $200. A
stocking donated by ``Old Blue Eyes'' got a $155 bid. A stocking
from Tom Cruise drew a $100 bid and Amy Irving's went for $70.

   Mike Farrell, Sally Kellerman and other

   Stars boarded buses at the Screen Actors Guild offices in
Hollywood and traveled to the rehabilitation center in southeast Los
Angeles County for daylong festivities including celebrity-patient
wheelchair races.
   ``The patients always win, by the way,'' said academy official
Jim Malinda, directing teams of stars through the wards from a
command post. ``The patients are a little bit better in the
wheelchairs.''
   The academy's 19th annual visit celebrated the center's 100th
birthday.
   The visit is officially called the Allen Ludden Rancho Los Amigos
Medical Center Holiday Party, after the late host of the
``Password'' TV show. Several other stars also planned to attend
throughout the day.
   The academy buys gifts such as TV sets and videocassette
recorders for all of the 450 patients, said event spokesman Murray
Weissman.

   The writer-director of ``Platoon,'' ``Wall
Street'' and ``Talk Radio,'' known for his angry film characters,
says parenthood and marriage counseling have mellowed him.
   ``You probe your feelings and your relationship to your mom, your
relationship to women, whether you're a misogynist or not,'' Oliver
Stone said, adding, ``The issue came up: `Why in your films do you
treat (women negatively)?''
   ``And I think there's some truth to it. I think there's some
anger and hostilities that I had toward my mother that are still
being worked out,'' Stone said in the January issue of Vanity Fair.
``There was an ugly divorce and it came at age 14, a crucial age.''
   ``And having a child has, brings things out, these repressed
things,'' he added. ``I'm bringing out the woman in me more and more
in my work. I think I made big strides in `Talk Radio.'''
   In an angrier period of his life, Stone said, he returned from
Vietnam combat duty to live in a seamy, New York City tenement
painted blood-red from floor to ceiling.
   ``I believed in (Jim) Morrison's incantation. `Break on through.
Kill the pigs. Destroy. Loot,''' he said.
   ``If the right people had said the right things to me, I might
have gone after (President Richard) Nixon,'' Stone said, confirming
that he meant killing the former president. ``Oh, yeah, yeah. If I'd
felt the flood was with me. There was a moment there. It could have
happened.''
   The homicidal component of his rage has been sublimated in his
screenplays and _ now that he's a husband and father _ ``the
suicidal impulses are gone,'' Stone said casually.

<TEXT>
   A song in memory of fallen police
officers, written and recorded by a policeman who died two days
later in an accident, has become the most popular song at the radio
station where it debuted.
   The calls to WQIK-FM haven't stopped since the song ``When Daddy
Comes Home'' was first played Friday.
   ``We have just been swamped on the phones,'' program director
Jack Evans said. ``It's been the most requested song of the day.''
   Officer Ray Shinholser, 30, died Wednesday from injuries suffered
when he was thrown from his motorcycle Tuesday night on his way to
work. His funeral was Saturday.
   After Shinholser's death, his 4-year-old son Michael's voice was
added to the song, reciting the plaintive refrain, ``I miss you,
Daddy. I miss you.''
   ``That's it. That's the part that really gets to people,'' said
Officer Jimmy Guthrie, secretary of the Fraternal Order of Police.
   Michael, Shinholser's widow, Debbie, the officer's manager and
two fellow officers brought the first copy of the song's master tape
to WQIK Thursday night.
   The song was inspired by the death of Officer Gary Bevel, who was
fatally shot in May 1983. But the lyrics foreshadow the songwriter's
own death, saying in part, ``Momma, when's Daddy coming home to hug
his little man?''
   WQIK news director Tim Maguire called the offices of syndicated
radio commentator Paul Harvey in Chicago this week to relay the
story; Harvey opened his Thursday broadcast with Shinholser's story.
   Guthrie said his office has received hundreds of calls from radio
listeners wanting to buy the tape.
   Shinholser originally intended all proceeds to go toward the
construction fund for a police memorial in Washington, Guthrie said.
Now, part of the profits will be placed in a college fund for
Shinholser's two children.
   The police union is producing tapes of the song.

   Tanks and soldiers that could be used
for earthquake relief instead patrol Armenia's capital, evidence
that the Kremlin believes a show of force is still needed to keep a
lid on nationalistic unrest.
   Already, dozens of Armenian activists have been jailed for
alleged curfew violations. Other activists say, however, that the
real reason for the arrest has been their continued political
agitation.
   It was the activists' heated campaign for Armenia's annexation of
the Nagorno-Karabakh district in neighboring Azerbaijan that drew
world attention to Armenia for most of the year.
   But the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed an estimated 55,000 people
in northwestern Armenia became the focus of the republic's 3.4
million people.
   The activists did not give up, however, and despite the
government's avowed policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness, it has
launched a crackdown against them.
   Three days after the quake, while Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev was visiting Armenia to check on disaster relief, five
leaders of the Karabakh committee, an activist group, were arrested.
Another leader was arrested later, and the other five are now
reported in hiding.
   The unsanctioned group has spearheaded the annexation campaign,
which has led to bloodshed between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The
Kremlin has refused to turn Nagorno-Karabakh over to Armenia.
   During a visit to Yerevan, Gorbachev blasted committee members as
``provocateurs'' trying to take advantage of the instability created
by the earthquake.
   ``They must be stopped,'' he said.
   The Armenian Communist Party newspaper, Kommunist, accused the
militants of harming earthquake relief efforts.
   ``From a snug headquarters, the committee contacts hospitals with
incompetent instructions, disseminates wild rumors and sends
spurious data to the republic's Health Ministry, thus hampering the
effort to organize effective medical aid to quake victims,''
Kommunist charged, according to a summary of the article carried
Saturday by Tass.
   Some Armenians agree with some of the official criticism. Larisa
Gishiyan, 36, said the Nagorno-Karabakh issue must remain a priority
but that it ``shouldn't be brought up during mourning.''
   But the activists believe the Karabakh issue must not be put
aside for anything.
   ``If a person dies in your home, you still must eat, breathe,''
said Ruzan Gorgisyan, whose husband Mofses, an Armenian nationalist,
was arrested Nov. 27 and sentenced to 30 days in jail.
   A Politburo commission overseeing earthquake relief said Saturday
that Karbakh committee members were making ``instigatory talks'' and
handing out leaflets calling for demonstrations and strikes, Tass
said.
   The activists' anger is increasingly directed at Gorbachev. They
say he was heckled and sworn at during his visit to the disaster
area because of his handling of the Karabakh issue, but those
reports could not be independently confirmed.
   Mrs. Gorgisyan and Martin Martirosyan of the Armenian group
Alliance for National Self-Determination have even claimed the
destruction in Armenia was caused not by an earthquake but by some
government-run operation to punish the Armenian people.
   ``He (Gorbachev) used a national tragedy for his goals,''
Martirosyan said.

   A hacker who browsed for weeks through
the unclassified computer system of a top federal nuclear weapons
laboratory has been identified and has apologized to authorities.
   No arrests have been made, officials said Saturday. FBI and lab
officials refused to identify the hacker.
   ``In a communication, he regretted the difficulty caused by his
actions and agreed to stop accessing LLNL computers,'' said Jeff
Garberson, spokesman at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
   Lab officials had pleaded through local media for the hacker to
contact them. The pleas led to several phone calls identifying
possible suspects, but it was unclear if the identity of the hacker
was discovered through a tip.
   A spokesman said earlier in the week that the hacker did not
invade the lab's top secret nuclear weapons research computers,
which are physically and electronically separated from the
unclassified system.
   The lab, run by the University of California at Berkeley, is one
of the nation's two centers for design, manufacture and testing of
nuclear weapons. The other is at Los Alamos, N.M.
   The FBI is investigating the case, spokesman John Holford said.
   Garberson said because criminal charges may be filed, lab
officials will not provide any further information.
   The hacker first appeared on the lab's Internet system about two
weeks ago. The system connects research facilities and universities
nationwide.
   The hacker accessed various computers at the lab and even gave
himself ``super user'' status so he could roam through files.
However, no data or files were destroyed.
   Lab officials described him as ``joy riding'' through the system
to see what he could get into. He made at least 11 system
trespasses, the last on Dec. 10.
   The infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by a
computer ``virus'' that struck nationwide last month and by another
hacker two weeks ago. Both of the latest invasions were through
different holes in the system and there may yet be other access
points that have not been patched.

<HEAD>Leaders Of Electricity Workers' Strike Sentenced To Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government tribunal has sentenced 11
officials to life imprisonment for calling a strike by workers at
the national electricity utility that caused a four-day nationwide
power outage.
   The tribunal sentenced the men Friday in the northern city of
Kaduna after they were convicted of instigating the Oct. 5-8
blackout.
   The men are top officials of the staff association that
represents the utility's senior officials, who struck to demand a
review of their salaries and benefits as part of a plan to run the
authority on a commercial basis.
   Authorities say the blackout caused untold hardships and many
deaths in public hospitals. Justice Mofoye Oyetunde, chairman of the
tribunal, said the convicted men had placed their own needs above
the needs of society.
   ``With every right there must be a duty. Your duty was not to put
the whole country in total blackout. Only God knows how many persons
died as a result of the strike action and the great economic loss
incurred by the government and the nation as a whole,'' said
Oyetunde.
   The sentence is subject to review by the military government's
Armed Forces Ruling Council, and the men had 14 days to appeal.
   In the past the National Electric Power Authority has charged
rates well below cost, failed to collect many accounts and failed to
guarantee a stable electricity supply.

   Czechoslovakia announced Saturday it
has stopped jamming Radio Free Europe after two decades, and the
U.S.-owned network urged Bulgaria to stop its interference with the
station's signals.
   The Czechoslovak government said the jamming of the Munich-based
radio station ended on Friday.
   ``We will be happy to be able to get our message through at
last,'' said Bill Marsh, the executive vice-president of Radio Free
Europe.
   Marsh said the station will consider how to take better advantage
of the cleared air waves between Munich and Czechoslovakia.
   ``We would be able to include more music, and we could also
eliminate some repeat programs. All our jammed services had been
repeated to make sure we got through,'' Marsh said.
   He said Bulgaria is the only Soviet bloc country that continues
to hinder Radio Free Europe signals. ``We'd like to see the last of
the jamming countries stop the jamming.''
   Marsh said Bulgaria had unexpectedly turned off some jammers
aimed at Radio Free Europe on Friday night, but switched them back
on after several hours.
   Sources in Prague, who insisted on anonymity, said Czechoslovakia
also had stopped jamming Deutsche Welle, a West German radio station
based in Cologne.
   Hans Petrik, a spokesman for Deutsche Welle, said interference of
Czech-language broadcasts had stopped ``several months ago.''
   Petrik said Deutsche Welle's sister station, Deutschlandfunk, was
responsible for the Czech-language programs. ``But they sometimes
use our shortwave transmitters to send them.''
   He said Czechosovakia's jamming of both West German stations had
stopped.
   On Nov. 29, the Soviet Union stopped 35 years of hindering
signals from Radio Free Europe's sister station, Radio Liberty. Last
year, the Soviets stopped jamming the U.S. government-operated Voice
of America.
   Radio Liberty broadcasts in 14 languages to the Soviet Union.
Radio Free Europe transmits to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Poland, Romania and the Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania.
   Western stations such as Radio Free Europe have kept East
Europeans informed on such historic events as the failed 1956
Hungarian revolt, the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the
1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Top State Department Official Warns PLO Terrorism Would End US
Dialogue</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Restores first reference to Shultz in graf 20 and dropped word
``was'' in graf 26</NOTE>

   The United States informed the Palestine
Liberation Organization that if it engages in terrorism the newly
opened U.S. talks would be discontinued, a top State Department
official said Saturday.
   ``There is no way this dialogue can be sustained if terrorism is
persistent and traceable to known elements of the PLO,'' Assistant
Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy said.
   Murphy, in an interview with The Associated Press, said Robert H.
Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, made the point
strenuously to a PLO delegation in their talk Friday in Carthage, an
ancient city on the outskirts of Tunis.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, at a brief news conference at PLO
headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, said Saturday that the PLO would
``do all our best to stop'' terrorism but said he could not
guarantee that ``one person here or individual there'' might not
ignore his wishes.
   Arafat said the PLO's main priority in the talks is to push for
an early convening of an international peace conference on the
Middle East. The United States has said any resolution of the Middle
East crisis would have to come from direct negotiations between
Israel and its neighbors, while Israel has refused to include the
PLO in any talks.
   Arafat described Friday's meeting as a ``step in the right
direction'' toward a ``just and comprehensive settlement.''
   At the same news conference, PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman
charged that Israel was trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO contacts by
using deadly force against Palestinians.
   One potential sticking point in the talks was apparent:
Abdul-Rahman said a settlement must include establishment of an
independent Palestinian state while the United States has said its
decision to open a dialogue with the PLO did not affect U.S.
opposition to such a state.
   Friday's session was the first authorized U.S. meeting with the
PLO in at least 13 years. No further meetings have been scheduled as
yet, said Murphy, who said major developments in the final five
weeks of the Reagan administration are unlikely. Abdul-Rahman said
he did not expect a second meeting until after President-elect Bush
takes office next month.
   Murphy said terrorism was the ``lead item'' on the U.S. agenda
and took up half of the 75-minute meeting with a four-man PLO
delegation.
   While the PLO did not make a specific promise in response, Murphy
said, ``there was the general comment from their side that this
dialogue is too important to have it messed up.''
   The PLO delegation implied Arafat would make a special effort to
restrict the activities of more radical elements, said Murphy, the
State Department's senior Middle East specialist.
   Some Palestinian leaders have denounced Arafat's statements on
Israel. Official newspapers in Syria also opposed the U.S.-PLO
meeting, saying ``real peace should be taken by force,'' while
President Ali Khamenei of Iran said at a prayer meeting Friday in
Tehran that ``the way to fight Zionism is by force and power.''
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he was
shocked by the U.S. decision and announced he was preparing a new
peace initiative.
   ``Of course it's painful to receive such a blow, especially from
friends,'' Shamir said on Israel radio. ``But let's not exaggerate,
we have had differences of opinion with our friends.'' Shamir has
offered to hold direct peace talks with Jordan while excluding the
PLO.
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger had promised Israel
in 1975 the United States would shun the PLO if it did not accept
the legitimacy of the Jewish state. The promise helped induce Israel
to relinquish land in the Sinai desert to Egypt.
   Murphy said the PLO delegation made the point to Pelletreau that
``not everybody is under PLO control'' and can be deterred from
terrorism. ``That obviously is not going to be a sustainable
position should there be a rash of incidents which we would term
terrorism,'' Murphy said.
   Arafat on Wednesday renounced terrorism ``in all forms.'' The
statement was one of three conditions set by the United States for
opening talks with the PLO.
   The two other conditions were explicit acceptance of Israel's
right to exist and approval of 1967 and 1973 resolutions of the U.N.
Security Council affirming all Middle Eastern countries should be
able to live in peace within secure boundaries.
   A little more than two weeks earlier, Secretary of State George
P. Shultz had condemned the PLO as a terrorist organization, called
Arafat an ``accessory'' to terrorism and denied the PLO chairman
permission to speak before the United Nations in New York.
   As a result, the U.N. General Assembly shifted its debate on the
Arab-Israeli dispute to Geneva.
   Murphy said Shultz's decision authorizing ``substantive
dialogue'' with the PLO had not changed Shultz's view of the PLO or
his opposition to establishment of a Palestinian state.
   In fact, the U.S. official said, ``nothing that happened
Wednesday has changed our position or approach to the peace
process.''
   These include the view that an independent Palestinian state on
the West Bank and Gaza, which are now held by Israel, would not be
viable, and that the PLO should not have a separate seat in any
Mideast peace talks.
   ``We haven't pulled back from any of the Shultz initiative,''
Murphy said.
   He referred to the plan for Arab-Israeli negotiations Shultz took
to the Middle East earlier this year. It was not accepted by Israel
and Jordan, while Palestinian Arabs invited to meet with him in
Jerusalem did not show up.
   Key features of the U.S. proposal included a joint delegation of
Jordanians and Palestinians to negotiate with Israel and having
Israel give up some _ but not all _ of the land it won in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Murphy said Pelletreau's meeting with PLO officials ``didn't
answer any of the tough problems'' but with a U.S. dialogue
established it will be easier for the United States and the PLO to
understand each other's positions.
   In the past, Murphy said, Saudi Arabia and Egypt had informed the
PLO of where the United States stood. ``Cutting out the third party
in a conversation should make it clearer,'' he said.
   The decision to open the dialogue, meanwhile, won praise from
West Virginia Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the outgoing Senate majority
leader.
   Byrd, in the Democratic Party's weekly radio address, said the
PLO's meeting of the U.S. conditions was ``long overdue'' and said
progress would depend on Arafat's success in controlling ``those
factions within the PLO who believe that terrorism is a legitimate
recourse.''
   Byrd called on Israel to support the dialogue as ``an opportunity
to be seized, an opportunity to develop a new national consensus
regarding negotiations with the PLO.''

   Two white teen-agers who burned a cross
on a black family's lawn have been ordered to help rebuild a
125-year-old black church that was destroyed by fire in an unrelated
attack.
   J.R. James, whose lawn was burned, urged St. Clair County Judge
Milton S. Wharton on Friday to issue a stern penalty.
   ``I didn't spend 20 years in the military to have five clowns
burn a cross in my yard,'' James said. ``Now the shoe is on the
other foot. I know who my enemy is. I can deal with that.''
   In all, five white teen-agers were charged in the Sept. 24
cross-burning.
   Two of the boys, ages 14 and 16, were ordered to work 100 hours
rebuilding the New Bethel AME Church of Rocky Fork in Godfrey, which
was destroyed by fire Oct. 18 for the second time in six months. A
man who said he thought the church was a place of devil worship has
been charged with arson in the October fire.
   ``I want you while you're working there to see what affect this
type of behavior can have on innocent people,'' said Wharton, who is
black. ``You'll be working right along side of them.''
   The judge also ordered the teen-agers to remain under court
supervision for three years. Two other defendants, Jerry Tuck, 17,
and Joseph Burdell, 18, were charged as adults. They pleaded guilty
to ethnic intimidation and were ordered to serve holidays in jail
and to perform community service.
   Sentencing was postponed for a fifth teen-ager who faces a
burglary charge in an unrelated case.

<TEXT>
   The bodies of two Americans were
recovered Saturday from the remains of a Lear jet that inexplicably
bypassed its Texas destination and crashed in the mountains of
northeastern Mexico, authorities said.
   Ernesto Marquez Rivera, Coahuila state district attorney in
Monclova, said by telephone that the bodies of a man and a woman
were recovered early Saturday from the wreckage.
   He identified the bodies by their driver's licenses as Susan
Reynolds, 27, and Larry Morris, 39, both of Dallas.
   The bodies were taken to a funeral home in the small town
Cuatrocienegas, about 40 miles north of the crash site, Marquez
said. He said they would be taken later to Monclova, about 50 miles
east of there, for autopsy.
   Roger Walsh, U.S. consular section chief in this capital city,
said a consular representative had been sent to Monclova to identify
the bodies.
   Marquez said the plane was found intact but badly damaged in the
brush of the mountainside. ``There wasn't a fire,'' he said. ``The
bodies have been beaten up but not burned.''
   Walsh said he could give no further details about the plane's
occupants until their families are notified. He said the consulate
would help the families return the bodies to the United States.
   Marquez said federal authorities would investigate the crash to
determine a cause.
   The jet, with two people aboard, left Memphis, Tenn., shortly
after 5 a.m. Friday with a flight plan for Addison Airport, a suburb
north of Dallas, according to the Federal Aviation Administration in
Dallas and the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.
   It crashed between 7 and 8 a.m. in the mountains about 100 miles
northwest of this northern capital city, the embassy said.
   Why the Dallas-based jet overflew its destination remained a
mystery Saturday.
   An F-16 and another plane tried to contact the jet's pilot after
it climbed to more than 40,000 feet, but the pilot did not respond,
the FAA said.
   Roger Crownrich, the craft's owner, said the plane was ``bound to
be on autopilot.''
   He identified the plane's co-pilot as 25-year-old Susan Reynolds,
a graduate electrical engineer and a former NASA employee.
   Crownrich, the owner of Crownrich Construction Management Inc. in
Dallas, said the plane was on a charter run at the time of the
crash. He said the regular pilot was not aboard the plane and he
didn't know who was flying with Ms. Reynolds.
   He said Ms. Reynolds and a pilot flew to Memphis regularly to
pick up Federal Express packages for delivery.

   A man who pleaded tearfully on television
four months ago for the safe return of his missing 11-year-old
daughter has been arrested in her death, authorities said.
   Gerald Estrade, a 32-year-old postal carrier, was arrested Friday
night on a charge of first-degree murder and was ordered held
without bond, said Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee.
   ``He was a suspect all along. From the first day he was a
suspect,'' Lee said. ``There were a lot of things that kept leading
(us) back to Estrade. We don't have an eyewitness. (But) we have
physical evidence in our possession.''
   Hunters discovered Melissa Estrade's remains on Dec. 3 in woods
near Pass Christian, Miss.
   Estrade had said his daughter disappeared after he dropped her
off at a Metairie day camp Aug. 3. A staff member at the day camp
reported Melissa missing when she failed to show up for a roll call.
   Estrade is divorced from Melissa's mother, Sharon Smith, who had
hired a psychic to try to find her daughter.
   An autopsy and examination by forensic experts have so far failed
to determine how the girl died, but the effort continues, Coroner
Robert Treuting said.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian rebel leader,
said Saturday that Prime Minister Hun Sen must accept a five-point
peace plan before negotiations can continue.
   ``It's take it or leave it,'' Sihanouk told a meeting of his
followers, who make up one of three rebel groups fighting the
Cambodian government.
   Sihanouk, who has met Hun Sen three times in France _ the first
in December 1987 and the latest last month _ called the prime
minister ``a collaborator and a traitor,'' and the ``valet of the
Vietnamese'' who ``sells off his country to the foriegners.''
   Hun Sen's communist government was installed by the Vietnamese
after they invaded Cambodia in 1978, ending the four-year reign of
terror by the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge.
   The five-point peace plan was outlined in July, when the leaders
of the four Cambodian factions met in Jakarta, Indonesia. The fourth
group is the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front
led by former Prime Minister Son Sann.
   The points of the plan are:
   _A precise timetable for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from
Cambodia. Hun Sen claims Vietnam has 50,000 troops in Cambodia, but
Western experts put the figure at more than 100,000.
   _The dismantling of Hun Sen's regime
   _General elections under the control of an international
commission
   _Formation of a new government and army that would include
supporters of the four sides
   _A U.N. peacekeeping force based in Cambodia.
   Sihanouk said Saturday he would run for president when the
elections are held.
   The prince, speaking in French, said his meeting with Hun Sen
last month was ``a total 500 percent failure.''
   Sihanouk last week also met Khieu Samphan, the leader of the
Khmer Rouge, in the village of Fere-en-Tardenois, northeast of
Paris. After the meeting, Khieu Samphan told reporters his group
considered Sihanouk the ``national leader'' of Cambodia and he
endorsed the five-point plan.
   ``They are not sincere, but they're intelligent,'' Sihanouk said
Saturday of the Khmer Rouge. Although they were ``murderers,'' he
added, they could not be ignored in planning Cambodia's future.
   The communist Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians when they ruled the country in 1975-78.
   The 40,000-member Khmer Rouge is the strongest of the three rebel
groups, followed by Sihanouk's force, which the prince said Saturday
has 20,000 soldiers and is growing.
   If the Khmer Rouge is excluded from a new Cambodian government,
Sihanouk added, they would become ``bandits, outlaws, terrorists,
and every time we built a bridge they'd destroy it.''
   He said any future agreement among the Cambodian factions must
include guarantees that human rights will be respected.
   The Cambodian government insists it must have a guarantee that
outside aid to the guerrilla forces, especially the Chinese-supplied
Khmer Rouge, must cease before the Vietnamese withdrawal.
   Hun Sen also has said the elections should be held under the
present government, while Sihanouk insists on the resignation of the
governmnet before the vote. Hun Sen also told reporters Friday that
he opposes an international peacekeeping force.

   A newspaper editor who was deported from
Lesotho for publishing articles about alleged government corruption
arrived in Kenya on Saturday night and was allowed to stay in the
country temporarily.
   The editor, South African-born Johnny Maseko, was detained for
six weeks in Lesotho before being deported by security police
earlier today.
   Police allowed a few relatives and friends of the 29-year-old
editor of The Mirror to see his plane off at the airport in Maseru,
the capital of Lesotho, a mountainous kingdom surrounded by South
Africa.
   ``We have allowed him to stay in the country temporarily. Until
he can find some place to go,'' an immigration officer in Nairobi
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Maseko said in a telephone interview from the airport in Nairobi
that he wants to go to South Africa to join his father. He said he
was born in the Indian Ocean port of Durban, and ``I have many
relatives there.''
   Maseko claims he is a Lesotho citizen through his parents were
working across the border when he was born. He fled South Africa in
1980 after becoming involved in anti-apartheid organizations.
   Police in Lesotho said Maseko is a South African refugee.
   Under an agreement with the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees,
the Lesotho government does not send South African refugees back to
their homeland or allow them to remain in Lesotho. They are sent to
a third country.
   The Mirror, which began publishing in mid-1988, is an independent
weekly.
   Lesotho is ruled by a six-man military council, in association
with King Moshoeshoe II, which took power in a January 1986 coup
after ousting a left-wing dictator, Chief Leabua Jonathan.
   All political activity is banned in Lesotho.
   Maseko's troubles began in November after he published articles
stating that Minister of Finance Evaristus Sekhonyana, who held the
same portfolio in the Jonathan government, had authorized the
transfer of millions of rands to the Swiss bank account of an
Italian construction company, Banco, which had failed to finish a
building project in 1981. The directors of the company had fled
Lesotho and the government liquidated the company.
   Maseko was detained under the Internal Security Act, which allows
temporary detention of people considered a threat to Lesotho's
national security. When he appealed to the Supreme Court for release
on the ground that he posed no such threat, he was charged with
criminally defaming the finance minister.
   When that charge was dropped, the head of the military council,
Maj. Gen. Metsing Lekhanya, authorized an extension of his detention.
   Maseko claimed that the secretary to the military council, Tom
Thebane, visited him and warned him about writing articles about
government officials.
   The paper has continued to be published by local journalists, but
its articles are widely regarded as less controversial.

<TEXT>
   A thriller about the kidnapping of the
president-elect which also features a vice-president from a
Midwestern state has gone into a second printing since its release
two months ago.
   The novel's author says it illustrates how the Constitution and
federal laws are unclear and contradictory about what would happen
if a president-elect were kidnapped between Election Day and when
the Electoral College votes. In real life, the Electoral College
meets Monday.
   In ``Oath of Office,'' a popular, crime-busting U.S. senator from
California defeats a one-term president but is kidnapped while
watching election returns. The country is plunged into a
constitutional crisis.
   Author Steven J. Kirsch, a lawyer, said his first novel poses the
question of what would happen if the president-elect were kidnapped.
Would the vice president-elect be inaugurated instead?
   Though the book doesn't mention President-elect George Bush or
Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, the fictional vice president-elect
in Kirsch's book _ which he sold in 1986 _ is a young senator from a
Midwestern state selected to give the ticket geographical balance.
   ``The electors would be going through the same mental gymnastics
if Bush were kidnapped,'' Kirsch said. ``What happens in real life
would be what I described in my book.''
   The 20th Amendment provides for the vice president-elect to
become president if the president-elect dies before he can be sworn
in.
   But what if the president-elect were kidnapped? Would the
electors qualify the president-elect as president, even though he's
missing? Would the vice president-elect be named president? Or would
the decision be thrown into the U.S. House?
   ``Everyone has agreed there is no precedent for this,'' Kirsch
said. ``There is no clear-cut answer, and if it happens, the country
would be in a worse crisis than Watergate.''
   In Kirsch's 355-page book, Jonathan Starr defeats Arthur
Sutherland to become the nation's first Jewish president-elect.
   But on election night Starr is kidnapped from his San Francisco
hotel room by henchmen of Tommy Duncan, a corrupt labor leader.
   The country is plunged into a constitutional crisis. Sutherland,
who is negotiating a secret Middle East peace plan, considers
whether he should have himself declared the winner. Charles Durkin,
the power-hungry speaker of the House, plots to steal the election.
And the Secret Service, the FBI and the press scramble to find Starr.
   ``The politics would be brutal,'' Kirsch said. ``Our allies
wouldn't know what would happen. It would be so unsettling to the
stock market. And people would be very worried.''
   Charles Walcott, an associate professor of political science at
the University of Minnesota, agrees that the Constitution is
ambiguous about what would happen if the president-elect were
kidnapped.
   ``It's not anticipated in the Constitution and it's not clearly
covered,'' he said.
   However, Walcott said he doesn't believe a constitutional crisis
would result. ``If it should happen, a way would be found to cover
it,'' he said. ``Probably the courts would not have trouble advising
what to do.''
   Kirsch, 37, said he began thinking about writing a book about a
Jewish president while a college student in the mid-1970s. He said
he found himself wondering how a Jewish president would deal with
the Middle East.
   He also was intrigued by what would happen if the president-elect
were kidnapped. He thought about a 1933 assassination attempt on
President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, in which Chicago Mayor Anton
Cermak was killed.
   ``I thought, `That's it. I'll merge the two stories,''' Kirsch
said.
   Kirsch began writing the book in 1980. Five years later, he
hooked up with an agent, Henry Morrison, who also represents
espionage-thriller writer Robert Ludlum and ``Rambo'' creator David
Morrell.
   After the book was rejected by 10 publishers, the paperback
division of Random House Inc. bought the manuscript in 1986. The
publisher, Kirsch said, decided to hold off issuing the book until
1988 to capitalize on the presidential election.
   Fawcett-Crest published ``Oath of Office'' in October. More than
100,000 copies of the book have been printed, according to
Fawcett-Crest spokeswoman Beverly Robinson.

   Nora Sullivan sold her grocery store in the
1960s and retired here, but she still has a file cabinet full of
bills due her from the Depression years.
   Last week she got a $100 check in a Christmas card from a family
that charged their groceries at her store in Ratliff City around
1935. A note said, ``Daddy wanted me to send you this on the debt we
owed you.''
   ``I opened it, and I didn't know what to say,'' Mrs. Sullivan
said.
   ``The file cabinets in the storage shed are full of statements
that have been left unpaid for more than 50 years. We've still got
people owes us over $1,000 bills.''
   She still has the records, but she no longer expects payments.
``I didn't expect this one, either,'' she said.
   The bills are past due because the Sullivans, Nora and her late
husband, J.E., opened the store in Ratliff City, which she still
calls Ratliff Corner, in 1927. Unfortunately, the store and the
Depression started at the same time.
   ``We sold groceries on the credit and charged them. We sure let a
lot of groceries out we never got money for.''
   But J.E., she said, was the kind of man ``who couldn't stand to
see people go hungry.''
   There was the winter of '29, when the bad weather lasted almost
six weeks and the Sullivans had the only car around that would run.
Her husband got in it and delivered food to people and cattle. Some
paid, some didn't, some still haven't.
   The family that sent the Christmas payment were neighbors and the
man who wrote the letter was a boy then.

   Competition is intense among
Detroit-area limousine drivers, but Chuck Fenech doesn't rely on his
31-foot motor home alone to set him apart from the pack.
   Fenech, a Ford Motor Co. pipe fitter who moonlights as a
chauffeur, says he has a gimmick: a bathroom.
   ``You'll see limos pulling up to an event ... they're so classy,
but everybody's running out to the trees,'' Fenech said. ``You've
had a few drinks, you're in trouble.''
   Last April, the 32-year-old entrepreneur from Garden City
invested about $35,000 in a customized recreational vehicle, created
a business motto _ ``Don't cramp your style'' _ and launched
Nighthawks Limousine Service.
   Some customers who expect a sleek stretch limo balk when Fenech
motors into their driveways with the two-tone, brown RV, he admitted.
   But inside, the lumbering limousine is equipped with a bar, two
lounge areas, a shower, a television set, a VCR, a microwave oven, a
refrigerator, a shower _ and the bathroom.
   ``They're thinking camper,'' he said. ``But once they get in,
they think it's awesome.''
   Hiring the hunkering home on wheels isn't cheap. Customers pay
$50 to $70 an hour for the service, with a three-hour minimum charge.
   Fenech's clients have varied from black-tie theatergoers to
denim-clad teen-agers en route to a rock concert.
   ``I've had people all decked out in here,'' he said. ``This is
classy _ it's not just like a camper. I'm not trying to compete with
the cars.''

<HEAD>China Ready To Help Iran Rebuild After War</HEAD>

   Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang told Iran's
foreign minister Saturday that China is ready to help Iran
reconstruct its economy after the eight-year Persian Gulf war, an
official report said.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told Zhao that Iran
``welcomes very much'' China's participation, the Xinhua News Agency
said.
   Velayati also briefed Zhao on the stalled Iran-Iraq peace talks
in Geneva, Xinhua said.
   The Iranian official, who returned home Saturday after a
three-day visit, told reporters that he also discussed the same
issues with Premier Li Peng and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen. He described the talks as fruitful, but did not elaborate.
   Velayati said China expressed interest in helping build
factories, dams, railroads and agricultural projects in Iran. But he
said no details had been worked out, and Iran had not asked China
for loans.
   The Iranian official also denied a recent report by diplomatic
sources in the Middle East that China delivered 50 J-6 and F-7
fighter jets to Iran before a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war took
effect Aug. 20.
   He reiterated Iran's claim that it captured its Chinese-made
weapons in battle from Iraq.
   China also has denied selling weapons to Iran, but U.S. and other
third-country sources say China has been one of Iran's main arms
suppliers.
   Mednews, a Paris-based newsletter specializing in Middle East
defense issues, said the jets were part of a 1985 agreement that
also called for China to supply air-to-air missiles and
air-to-ground rockets.
   Iran has positioned Chinese-made Silkworm missiles at the
entrance to the Persian Gulf and a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker was
attacked last year by such a missile. The United States responded by
briefly suspending its liberalization of technology sales to China.

<HEAD>Spain Rules Out Early Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday ruled out calling
early elections in response to a one-day general strike against
economic policies that shut down nearly all business and labor
activity.
   Government spokeswoman Rosa Conde told reporters no resignations
of any ministers were planned due to Wednesday's strike by the two
major leftist unions. She reiterated the Socialist administration's
willingness to open wide-ranging talks with the two major leftist
unions that organized it and top business leaders.
   But the Socialist-led General Workers Union and the
Communist-dominated Workers Commissions again rejected Socialist
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's offer to take part in talks with
the government and the head of the nation's key business
organization.
   The Socialists hold a comfortable majority in Parliament and do
not have to call elections until June 1990.
   The general strike was the first in 54 years. The unions want
unemployment insurance coverage broadened to include up to 48
percent of Spain's 2.7 million jobless and the smallest retirement
pensions increased to the legal monthly minimum wage of $394.
   Ms. Conde said a government representative, perhaps Gonzalez,
would explain the administration's view of the strike and the
demands of the unions before parliament Wednesday.
   Gonzalez issued a statement a day after the strike acknowledging
it as a ``political success'' and a ``tough political blow to the
government.'' He repeated his offer to discuss demands with unions
and the head of the top business organization.
   On Friday, leaders of the socialist-led General Workers Union and
the communist-dominated Workers Commissions appeared at a large,
peaceful demonstration in central Madrid and rejected the meeting
offered by Gonzalez if he insists the head of the nation's key
business organization attend.
   At least 40,000 people attended the rally.
   Despite an economic growth rate of 5 percent annually that puts
it at the top of Western European economies, 18.7 percent of the
people are unemployed, Europe's highest rate. Union leaders and
members have argued the time has come to share more of the spoils of
economic boom with workers and the poor.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy is further scaling back
operations in the Persian Gulf and will reduce its forces from 15 to
14 ships early next month, U.S. military sources said Saturday.
   In the latest change of procedure, U.S. warships will use radar
to monitor U.S.-flagged vessels in the waterway, said sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity. The move means the warships may no
longer be within quick reach in emergencies.
   One source said the change, like some earlier ones, reflects a
Pentagon judgment that the threat to shipping in the gulf has
decreased since the cease-fire in the war between Iran and Iraq went
into effect Aug. 20.
   At least 1 million people have been killed or wounded in the war,
which followed border skirmishes and an Iraqi invasion in September
1980. The fighting spilled over into the gulf with attacks on
foreign ships.
   There have been no armed incidents reported in the gulf since the
truce, and the United States has already reduced its forces in the
region by two ships. Other foreign navies are also reducing
operations or pulling out.
   However, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said during a
visit to the region Dec. 5 that Washington had made no plans for
major changes in forces because U.N.-sponsored peace talks between
Iran and Iraq are stalled.
   Senior U.S. officials have talked recently of an eventual force
of about 10 U.S. ships in the gulf.
   The cut in force strength results from cancellation of orders
last week for a missile frigate, USS Klakring, to leave for the gulf
from Charleston, S.C.
   Three others, the destroyer USS O'Bannon and the missile frigates
USS Hawes and USS De Wert sailed for the Gulf as planned, however,
and on arrival in January will replace ships completing three-month
duty tours in the waterway.
   The four leaving are the missile cruiser USS Josephus Daniels and
the missile frigates USS Aubrey Fitch, USS Doyle and USS Taylor.

<HEAD>Center-Right Leaders Back Vargas Llosa as Presidential Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Writer Mario Vargas Llosa raised his arms in
triumph at a rally where leaders of a center-right coalition
announced they will support him as their presidential candidate,
newspapers said Saturday.
   But Vargas Llosa did not formally respond to the offer of support
from the three-party Democratic Front, which includes former
President Fernando Belaunde Terry's Popular Party.
   However, his appearance and actions at Friday night's rally were
the closest he has come to formally accepting the coalition's
candidacy in the 1990 election against the center-left government of
President Alan Garcia.
   ``I did not leave my writing and my books to quit working, but to
save Peru from ruin,'' he was quoted as telling the rally.
   Peru is wracked by its worst economic crisis in this century,
with the annual inflation rate surpassing 1,200 percent. The country
also has been wracked by a leftist insurgency that has claimed more
than 12,000 lives.
   Vargas Llosa, 52, Peru's most celebrated writer, has spoken out
for a year against Garcia's government. In the last few months, he
has stepped up his campaign against the nationalization of Peru's
banks and for a reduced government role in the economy.
   He also opposes the United Left, a Marxist coalition favored to
win the 1990 election.
   The Democratic Front's announcement took many political observers
by surprise because the coalition had said it would not name its
candidate until one year before the April 1989 election.
   ``This decision was made with the soul and not with negotiation.
Vargas Llosa is the man we are going to work with and support,''
said Christian Popular Party leader Luis Bedoya, who in the 1960s
served as the mayor of Lima, Peru's capital.
   The Democratic Front is composed of the centrist Popular Action,
the center-right Christian Popular Party and the Liberty Movement, a
group of independents that has formed around the novelist.
   Vargas Llosa is the author of ``The Green House'' and
``Conversation in a Cathedral,'' and has been among those mentioned
in recent years as a possible winner of Nobel Prize in literature.

   An Aeroflot plane landed Saturday in West Berlin to
pick up supplies for quake-devastated Armenia, the first time in
memory Western officials allowed a Soviet plane to touch down in the
western sector of the divided city.
   Aeroflot announced that the four-engined IL-76 airplane, which
landed at Tegel Airport, was to pick up blankets, medical goods and
warm clothing collected by the German Red Cross and other groups.
   Aeroflot did not announce when the plane was scheduled to leave
Berlin.
   The U.S. Air Force also has volunteered its service in the relief
effort, flying goods into Soviet Armenia for victims of the Dec. 7
quake that officials say killed an estimated 55,000 people, injured
thousands and left a half million homeless.
   Meanwhile, West German contributions to the massive international
aid effort continue to grow. According to the West Berlin newspaper
Tagespiegel, the giant West German pharmaceutical company Schering
is donating $360,000 of medical goods to the relief cause.
   Berlin, the former German capital which lies inside communist
East Germany, has been divided into a communist eastern sector and
capitalist western sectors since the end of World War II. From June
1948 to September 1949, Soviet forces imposed a land blockade on the
western sectors, forcing the Allies to fly tons of supplies to
residents from the West in an operation known as the Berlin Airlift.
In 1950 the U.S., British and French western sectors were unified
into a West German state.

   A Soviet delegation on Saturday opened
a new round of talks on prisoner exchanges with Afghan guerrillas,
who said the Soviets refused to move the discussions beyond that
issue.
   Radio Kabul reported, in an apparent reference to guerrillas,
that ``criminal extremists'' blasted Mehthar Lam, the capital of the
northeastern province of Laghman, with 1,500 rockets over the last
three days. The radio said 15 people were killed and 24 injured.
   The radio report, monitored in Islamabad, said Afghan government
troops repulsed the guerrillas who were trying to overtake the city
about 60 miles northeast of the Afghan capital Kabul.
   The talks in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, centered on return of
four Soviet soldiers held by guerrillas in Afghanistan's northern
Baghlan province, said Abdul Rahim, one of two guerrilla delegates
to the talks.
   He said the Soviets, who back the Marxist Afghan government with
thousands of troops, refused to move the talks beyond prisoner
exchange. He said attempts to steer talks toward what guerrillas
call a Soviet escalation of combat failed.
   ``We showed our concern that we thought they were not serious''
about peace, he said.
   The guerrillas say about 5,000 Soviet soldiers have returned to
the southern city of Kandahar in recent days. Afghanistan's
second-largest city, Kandahar has been under guerrilla seige for
several months.
   There has been no independent confirmation of a renewed Soviet
presence there.
   The Soviet Union, which sent its forces to Afghanistan in
December 1979, began withdrawing its troops in May under an
agreement brokered by the United Nations. Half of more than 100,000
Soviet troops left the country by Aug. 15 and remainder are to leave
by Feb. 15.
   Rahim said the four-member Soviet delegation wanted proof of the
identity of the four Red Army prisoners.
   The rebel representative said it is impossible to show the
Soviets the four prisoners because of the ``war situation.''
   He accused the Soviets of stalling the exchange. He said the
guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or islamic warriors, are ready to
hand the four prisoners over for 100 guerrillas.
   ``They are delaying _ not us,'' said Rahim.
   The one-hour meeting in Islamabad on Saturday ended without any
agreement, he said.
   The Soviet Embassy declined to make any immediate comment.
   An earlier round of Soviet-rebel talks in Saudi Arabia in
November ended without reports of significant progress. Another
round of talks is expected to be held in Islamabad later this month.

<HEAD>City Cuts Off Funds For Gang-Control Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode has cut off funds to a
gang-control organization once considered a model program for
reducing street tension, forcing a halt to its programs.
   Goode said Friday that the Crisis Intervention Network's
financial problems, including a $203,000 debt to the Internal
Revenue Service, were insurmountable.
   ``We will not use city funds to pay off an old debt,'' he said.
   The mayor said he hoped the private, non-profit agency's program
and employees could be absorbed by another agency so that its work
could continue, but he said no alternatives have been explored.
   The group's executive director, Bennie J. Swans, said 38 of the
48 employees were laid off Friday and its programs were shut down.
He said he and the other nine employees would stay until Jan. 5,
when city funding ends, to tie up loose ends and try to find another
source of funds.
   ``Everyone agrees we've performed a valuable service,'' Swans
said. ``I think that the services are sorely needed in the community
and I think people are going to suffer because of it.''
   The decision to close the agency came after months of uncertainty
over its future, sparked by complaints of financial mismanagement.
   The Crisis Intervention Network was founded in 1975 as an arm of
city government.
   Its approach to gang warfare _ using street-savvy workers, many
of them former gang members, to mediate disputes and reduce
community tension _ won praise and became a model for programs
around the country.
   The network became a private, non-profit agency in 1979, but the
city has remained its principal source of funds, with city contracts
paying $1.5 million or more in each of the past three years.
   But three months ago, a group of current and former employees
wrote to elected officials and news media accusing Swans of spending
abuses and mismanagement.
   Swans called the allegations groundless, but acknowledged
bookkeeping problems, including a failure to send to the IRS about
$80,000 withheld from employee paychecks.
   The IRS filed a $203,000 lien against the network Dec. 9, said
David Kairys, co-chairman of the agency's board. He said the board
had not decided ``whether it's over, whether to reorganize,
bankruptcy. ... We have choices.''
   ``I think the city has gotten used to CIN stepping in when things
get hot,'' Kairys said. ``We are the envy of cities around the
country. It just seems unnecessary and detrimental for the city to
cut off the funding.''

<TEXT>
   The defense minister on Saturday
tried to defuse tensions behind a recent insurrection, defending the
military view of a repressive campaign against leftists that
convulsed the nation a decade ago.
   Horacio Jaunarena said civilians who applauded a March 1976
military coup must share some responsibility for the campaign by
security forces, known as the Dirty War, that killed 9,000
Argentines. He called the action necessary.
   The repression remains a burning political issue and the question
of whether it was necessary in order to end chaos divides Argentina,
which resumed civilian rule in 1985 after the military returned to
the barracks.
   Jaunarena's remarks, in a speech to newly commissioned officers,
is an apparent attempt to placate military resentment that burst
forth in a four-day insurrection earlier this month and lingers
despite the acceptance by the government of a key rebel demand _ a
pay increase.
   ``The great part of the (1970s) struggle was outside the
framework of constitutional governments, leaving open to question
the political and legal legitimacy of a battle that was necessary,''
Jaunarena told the officers at the Military College.
   The military view is that it fought an unconventional war against
leftist guerrillas using unconventional means and deserves a better
role in society. The view by human rights groups is that what
happened amounted to organized murder.
   ``The phenomenon (terrorism) was eliminated, but not the rebuke''
by society, he said. ``We should admit that we made a mistake. Are
we going to keep trying to put all the blame on one side ... or are
we going to accept the reality that is evident to every sensible
Argentine?''
   He said civilians in 1976 wanted an end to the bombings,
assassinations and kidnappings that had become almost daily
occurrences, and must share the responsibility.
   ``The coups through which we Argentines have lived were not the
exclusive action of the military,'' Jaunarena said.
   While the army fought guerrilla battles with the People's
Revolutionary Army, security forces as a whole have been condemned
for arresting several thousand Argentine citizens _ alleged
sympathesizers _ who ``disappeared'' and were presumed executed.
   The presence of President Raul Alfonsin at the Military College
indicated that Jaunarena spoke for the government.
   ``It is necessary to bring to an end a period of mutual scorn and
reciprocal ignorance,'' Jaunarena said. ``Our society has gone
through a crisis which should be confronted with the essential key
of unity.''
   A day before, army chief Lt. Gen. Jose Dante Caridi said in a TV
interview that he agreed with demands made by rebel commander Col.
Mohamed Ali Seineldin, including the need to reintegrate the armed
forces into society as valued members.
   ``I say emphatically: there was a war against subversion and it
is absolutely unjust to accuse the armed forces of genocide,''
Caridi said.
   The rebels demanded an end to the prosecution of officers for
human rights abuses committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship, a
shakeup of the command structure, and a bigger military budget.
   Alfonsin and leaders of the opposition Peronist Party have said
publicly that they oppose any amnesty for officers already convicted
of human rights abuses, or under prosecution on murder and torture
charges.
   In December 1985, a civilian court convicted five former military
junta members, including ex-military Presidents Jorge Videla and
Roberto Viola, for human rights abuses.

   A woman buried alive in the Armenian
earthquake helped keep her 3-year-old child alive by feeding it her
own blood during the eight days they were entombed, a health
official said Saturday.
   The 30-year-old mother apparently punctured each of her fingers
repeatedly and had the child suck on them as a source of
nourishment, said Dr. Ophelia Nazaryan, head physician at Childrens
Hospital No. 3 in the Armenian capital Yerevan.
   Trapped in a cellar when the Dec. 7 quake collapsed buildings in
their home city of Leninakan, the mother and child were rescued
Thursday, Ms. Nazaryan said in a telephone interview.
   Doctors said the child was in good condition Saturday and that
the mother's health was improving. Both lost a lot of weight during
their ordeal, said Ms. Nazaryan, who did not identify the mother or
child.
   The quake killed an estimated 55,000 people and injured thousands
more in the southern Soviet republic.

   New England was bracing for a winter storm Saturday that was to
bring up to 8 inches of snow, while temperatures were in the 60s and
70s in the South and the desert Southwest.
   A low pressure system off the mid-Atlantic coast was moving
northeast Saturday, prompting the National Weather Service to post
winter storm warnings for portions of Massachusetts and Maine, and
snow advisories for the rest of southern New England and portions of
New York.
   A gale warning was posted for the coasts of New Hampshire and
Maine.
   Snow showers brought light snow to the lower Great Lakes region,
and snow advisories were posted in the northern mountains of North
Carolina, Maryland and West Virginia.
   A heavy snow warning was posted for Ohio, where up to 15 inches
of snow were expected by Sunday morning. A snow advisory remained in
effect for the southern Sierra Nevada range of central California
   Snowfall totals for a six-hour period ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 2 inches at Marquette, Mich., and 1 inch at Charleston,
W.Va.
   Temperatures were in the 50s and 60s across Florida and the
central Gulf Coast region and in the 60s and 70s in the southwestern
deserts.
   But temperatures were below freezing from eastern Montana through
the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes region, with readings in the
teens from North Dakota to upper Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 2
degrees in the Maine cities of Caribou and Limestone, to 77 degrees
at Chandler, Ariz. The nation's low Saturday morning was 18 degrees
below zero at Houlton, Maine.
   The forecast for Sunday called for snow from the Great Lakes
region and the upper Ohio Valley to New England, and rain across
southern and central California into western Arizona.
   Mostly cloudy skies were forecast from the upper Mississippi
valley to the Tennessee Valley. Sunny skies will prevail across the
rest of the nation.
   Temperatures will remain below freezing all day from North Dakota
through the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes region to the middle and
northern Atlantic coast, with highs in the teens from Michigan
through New York and New England.
   Readings above 50 degrees were expected in much of California
through the southern Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley into
Florida, with readings in the 30s and 40s in most of the rest of the
nation.

   The government has accepted the
credentials of the first ambassador of the newly declared state of
Palestine, an official report said.
   The new ambassador was identified as Moudher Dadjani, according
to a statement from the Foreign Ministry broadcast by the government
news agency APS. The government took his credentials Friday, the
agency reported.
   Algeria was the first country to recognize the Palestinian state
after the Palestine National Council declared it Nov. 15 in Algiers.
Ground was broken for a Palestinian embassy the next day.
   The Palestine National Council, which functions as a
parliament-in-exile for the Palestine Liberation Organization based
in Tunisia, proclaimed the new state on territories occupied by
Israel with its capital as Jerusalem. Israel considers Jerusalem as
its capital.
   The United States does not recognize the newly declared state but
agreed this week to hold direct talks with the PLO.

   Palestinians shut down the occupied territories
Saturday to mourn the fatal shooting of five Arabs a day earlier,
and 18 Palestinians were wounded in new clashes with Israeli
soldiers, hospital source said.
   In the West Bank, a 9-month-old girl from the Dolev Jewish
settlement suffered a serious head injury in a stone-throwing
attack. Dozens of angry Jewish settlers blocked a highway in
retaliation, Israel radio said without providing details.
   The impromptu strike paralyzed the West Bank cities of Ramallah,
Tulkarem, Qalqilya and Hebron as well as Arab east Jerusalem and the
seaside Gaza Strip.
   In Gaza City, Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli troops, and
students abandoned classes to march with outlawed Palestinian flags,
an Arab reporter said. Black mourning flags were raised on school
rooftops.
   ``Strike against the occupation army,'' said a slogan painted by
Moslem fundamentalists in Gaza City. Groups of masked youths walked
the streets, ordering merchants to close their shops, Arab reports
said.
   Palestinians clashed with troops in some of Gaza's refugee camps.
Twelve people were wounded in stone-throwing protests in the
Jabaliya, Nusseirat, Khan Yunis, Shati and Bureij camps, Arab
doctors said. The army clamped a curfew on Shati, home to 42,000
Arabs.
   The army confirmed six wounded in Gaza and two in the West Bank
and said it was checking the other reports.
   Among the wounded was a 41-year-old woman struck by a bullet in
the back of the head, said officials at Gaza's Shifa Hospital. They
said they also treated two sisters, aged 3 and 7, who were hit by
rubber bullets.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, students took to the streets to hurl
stones at policemen. Ten young Arab protesters were detained during
a riot near national police headquarters, police spokesman Rafi Levy
said.
   In Ramallah, nine miles north of Jerusalem, streets were empty
except for groups of masked youths hurling rocks at Israeli troops,
Israel radio said. Officials at Ramallah hospital said they treated
two wounded men from the nearby Kafr ed-Dik village.
   Palestinians also held mourning processions in many West Bank
areas, Arab reports said. Hundreds of residents marched through the
narrow streets of Zawata village near Nablus, carrying black flags,
wreaths and outlawed Palestinian flags, and a mourning procession of
women was reported in Tulkarem.
   A 25-year-old curfew violator who decided to sneak out and visit
his neighbor was shot in the leg, hospital officials said.
   The strike was to protest the deaths Friday of five Palestinians
in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city.
   Four of the victims died Friday, and the fifth, 20-year-old
Mohammed Al-Kuni, died overnight of a chest wound at Nablus' Ittihad
Hospital, officials said.
   Thirty-two Palestinians were wounded Friday in other parts of the
occupied territories.
   Hundreds of black flags flew from Nablus rooftops Saturday. The
city and surrounding refugee camps, where 120,000 Palestinians live,
have been under military curfew since Friday.
   Despite the curfew, dozens of youths, their heads wrapped in
traditional checkered Arab headdresses, were in the streets, pelting
troops with rocks and eggs. Soldiers responded by firing tear gas
and rubber bullets.
   Three young Palestinians were wounded in the West Bank's Hawara
and Kafr Abush villages, Arab doctors said.
   At least 329 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed since
the uprising began in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel has
controlled since the 1967 Middle East war.
   The violence cast doubt on the scheduled reopening of secondary
schools in the West Bank. Israel's military administration said
about 230 secondary schools with over 30,000 students would reopen
Sunday after being closed since September.

<HEAD>Marcos Expected To Be Released From Hospital Sunday, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposed Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
was scheduled to go home Sunday after more than a week in the
hospital, an attorney said.
   Attorney John Bartko said final tests were being conducted
Saturday, and three doctors have been retained to review the results
of Marcos' stay at St. Francis Medical Center.
   The doctors are expected to provide evidence to the New York
federal court that Marcos is too ill to travel there for arraignment
on fraud and racketeering charges, Bartko said.
   Marcos, 71, was hospitalized Dec. 10 after reportedly suffering
chest pains. His doctors confirmed he suffers from weakened heart
muscles.
   A hospital spokeswoman said Saturday that Marcos ``is doing
fine.''
   Marcos faces federal racketeering charges in New York accusing
him of plundering his nation's economy during his 20-year rule and
stashing some of the money in the United States.
   He was to be arraigned in New York, but he and his lawyers
contend he is too frail to make the 10-hour flight. A
court-appointed doctor who examined him before his most recent
hospitalization concluded that he did have medical problems, but not
severe enough to prevent him from traveling. The doctor also said
Marcos faked symptoms of pain during the examination.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, has pleaded innocent to the same charges
and is free on bail. The couple have lived in exile here since they
were ousted from the Philippines in 1986.

<TEXT>
   A second defendant charged in the takeover
of a North Carolina newspaper has fled to a New York Indian
reservation, saying he is in fear for his life, his attorney said
Saturday.
   ``I view him as I would anyone fleeing a Third World
dictatorship,'' Ron Kuby, one of Eddie Hatcher's attorneys, said in
a telephone interview from his New York office. ``He has no
intention of returning to Robeson County unless or until democracy
is restored there.''
   He said Hatcher had telephoned him to say he was in New York but
would not specify where.
   However, in a phone call Saturday to The Associated Press,
Hatcher said he was with co-defendant Timothy Jacobs on the Onondaga
Indian Reservation near Syracuse, N.Y.
   ``I have left North Carolina,'' he said. ``I have taken sanctuary
in New York and I intend to stay here. I cannot be forced back.
There is no jurisdiction where I am. The United States has no
jurisdiction, and the state of New York does not.''
   Hatcher, 31, and Jacobs, 20, were indicted Dec. 6 by a Robeson
County, N.C., grand jury on state kidnapping charges, less than two
months after they were acquitted of federal hostage-taking charges
in the Feb. 1 takeover of The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton. A
trial date has not been set.
   Hatcher and Jacobs contend taking over the newspaper was the only
way they could draw attention to what they call public corruption in
Robeson County.
   Hatcher was free on $25,000 bond posted by the National Council
of Churches, with the stipulation that he stay in Robeson County and
appear for his court dates.
   ``This would appear to violate that,'' Kuby said. ``It's
unfortunate, but I understand why he did it.''
   Hatcher said he had written a letter to National Council of
Churches officials.
   ``I'm sure they will understandand it will be worked out in the
end,'' he said. ``They realize the situation we're in and they're
sympathetic to our cause.''
   No one answered the telephone Saturday afternoon at the church
group's headquarters in New York City.
   The Onondaga County Sheriff's Department said Saturday that it
had no jurisdiction over the reservation and could not go onto the
property to look for Hatcher.
   Robeson County officials said Saturday they had no information on
Hatcher's whereabouts.
   ``We did not have him under surveillance,'' said Jimmy Maynor,
chief of detectives for the sheriff's department. ``If he has fled
to avoid prosecution, then necessary steps will be taken if he fails
to appear in court.''
   Onondaga Indian Chief Leon Shenandoah, reached at his home
Saturday, said he did not know where Hatcher was and refused further
comment.
   Jacobs fled to the New York reservation when the state charges
were filed and was arrested Tuesday after a car chase with state
police near Oneida, N.Y. He is scheduled to appear in Madison
County, N.Y., court Jan. 12 on charges stemming from the chase.
   He was released Friday under $25,000 bond, also posted by the
Council of Churches, after Onondaga Indian leaders gave a sworn
statement that they would not harbor him if New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo orders his extradition to North Carolina.
   Gov. Jim Martin has said he'll push for Jacobs' extradition.
   Kuby said Hatcher said he has received recent death threats.
   ``I will not return to North Carolina until we have a just system
of government in North Carolina and that means the resignation of
Governor Jim Martin and his blood-thirsty vultures,'' Hatcher said.

   Ten days after Armenia's devastating
earthquake, rescue workers freed a 62-year-old woman from a
collapsed building Saturday, but officials indicated they will soon
halt efforts to rescue others.
   In another dramatic rescue tale, a health official said Saturday
that a woman trapped in her basement helped keep her 3-year-old
alive by pricking her own fingers and letting the child suck her
blood.
   The health of the 30-year-old mother, who was rescued Thursday
after eight days, was improving and her child was in good condition,
said Dr. Ophelia Nazaryan, head physician at Childrens Hospital No.
3 in Yerevan.
   A national Politburo commission overseeing relief operations in
northwestern Armenia said the ``first and most acute stage of rescue
operations is drawing to an end,'' the official Tass news agency
reported from Yerevan, Armenia's capital. The high-level commission
said preparations were beginning to rebuild housing, factories and
farms in the zone struck by the Dec. 7 quake.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who heads the commission, said
``the focus of the relief effort will soon shift to restoration
work,'' Tass reported.
   However, in a possible split between Moscow and Armenian
officials on relief priorities, Armenian Communist Party leader
Suren Arutunyan said ``rescuing people is remaining the main task in
the stricken areas,'' Tass said.
   Meanwhile, leaders of government ministries met Saturday in
Yerevan to determine how to rebuild the ravaged area, where the
homes of an estimated 500,000 people were ruined.
   The official casualty toll in the earthquake that rocked
northwestern Armenia is an estimated 55,000 dead with thousands
injured.
   Tass said Saturday night that a total of 23,390 bodies have been
recovered. That would mean about an equal number of victims may
still lie buried in the ruins.
   In the past 24 hours, the woman in Leninakan was the only
survivor found by rescue parties combing through debris, Tass said
late Saturday. Altogether, 89 bodies were also removed from
collapsed apartment houses and other buildings, it said.
   Worsening weather will bring wet snow and wind to the quake zone,
where tens of thousands are living in tents or in the open air, the
Politburo commission said Saturday. Tass said said 9,862 people were
evacuated from the disaster area Friday and Saturday and more than
24,000 people who lost their homes were living in the region in
other shelter.
   An Armenian official told Soviet television Friday night that 20
people had been found alive in the ruins of Leninakan on Thursday
and one in Spitak, an Armenian city virtually destroyed in the quake.
   However, a government official overseeing search and rescue
efforts in Leninakan, once home to more than 250,000 people, said it
was now just as urgent to uncover and bury the dead as it was to
find more survivors. Otherwise, disease could spread, said Armenian
Deputy Prime Minister Vardkes Artsruny.
   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross urged a
temporary halt to planning new flights of worldwide relief shipments
to the Soviet republic to assess where relief was most needed and
avoid waste.
   Edgard Eeckman, a spokesman for the League of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies, said ``It's not that that there are no more
needs in Armenia. The message is, let's stop for a little while to
make an evaluation.''
   The trapped woman in Leninakan, identified by witnesses only as
Lucy, was eased from the rubble after a 20-member rescue team from
Czechoslovakia heard her voice from underneath, witnesses said.
   It took 2{ hours to free the gray-haired woman from the wreckage
of what had been the kitchen of a third-floor apartment.
   The bodies of four children, apparently the woman's
grandchildren, were also found in the debris.
   The woman, who looked alert and gripped the stretcher she was
placed on, was rushed to a hospital. Chief Dr. Sergei Uruman
marveled that she was still alive after being buried for 10 days,
but said she had suffered extensive injuries to a thigh and was in
critical condition.
   ``It was a miracle, but I doubt she will live,'' said Uruman.
   Near the ruined nine-story building, sobbing by a smouldering
campfire, sat the woman's daughter, who appeared to be in her 40s.
She repeated the names of relatives killed in the same apartment
where her mother was found.
   In another section of the wrecked building, rescue workers
uncovered the bodies of a man, woman and child who had died while
huddled together.
   The Armenian official whose report was broadcast on Soviet
television Friday said the discovery of a survivor in Spitak spurred
officials there to continue looking for survivors for 10 more days.
An estimated 15,000 of 25,000 people in that city were killed.
   Artsruny said rescue efforts would continue for a few more days
in Leninakan, but no firm deadline to stop had been set.
   Ryzhkov has said some of the rescue work is going slowly because
relatives are lying in front of bulldozers to prevent them from
moving in until their relatives' bodies were recovered.
   In Leninakan, Artsruny said demolition of buildings left
partially standing could begin in two days.

   A patient was knocked to the ground Saturday during an
anti-abortion protest at a clinic in Pennsylvania, one of six states
where demonstrations were held. More than 300 people were arrested.
   Police arrested 79 protesters in Harrisburg, Pa.; 58 in Baton
Rouge, La.; 101 in Concord, Calif.; 40 in Chamblee, Ga.; 13 in
Indianapolis; and 20 in Dallas.
   In Harrisburg, about 175 demonstrators gathered outside the
Hillcrest Women's Clinic, authorities said. The majority of the
protesters were men, said Peggy Ross, director of educational
programs for the clinic.
   One man knocked a patient and an escort to the ground, but no one
was hurt, she said.
   The demonstration did not disrupt operations at the clinic, she
said, adding, ``None of our patients called in to cancel.''
   Chris Kahlenborn, one of the demonstrators, said the group was
``under the principles of Operation Rescue,'' referring to a
Binghamton, N.Y.-based group that orchestrated protests this year at
the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta and in dozens of other
cities around the nation, resulting in more than 9,000 arrests.
   Harrisburg Police Cpl. Frank Fauasuli said all the people
arrested were released a short time later. They will be subject to a
fine of up to $300.
   In Baton Rouge, La., about 500 people gathered outside the Delta
Women's Clinic, and arrests numbered at least 58, authorities said.
   Protesters took as long as an hour to crawl on their knees from
clinic entrances to police buses.
   ``I was hoping it would slow them down and keep the clinic closed
this morning,'' said one demonstrator, Louisiana State University
graduate student Thomas Palfrey. ``I'm here to protest the killing
of unborn babies and lend support to the women who realize the pain
and guilt after abortion.''
   Patients began arriving at the clinic about 6 a.m., about an hour
before the protesters, and the clinic closed about 9:30 a.m. when
all the patients had been seen.
   ``We did procedures this morning and the patients are ready to
leave,'' said spokeswoman Esther McGuire. ``Their goal was not
achieved. Abortions have been performed.''
   Baton Rouge Police Chief Wayne Rogillio said those arrested would
be charged under a city ordinance for failure to leave a premises _
a misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of a $500 fine and 30 days
in jail.
   Saturday's demonstration followed similar protests on Friday at
another Baton Rouge clinic, where 108 of about 250 protesters were
arrested.
   In Concord, Calif., 101 people were arrested Saturday outside a
Planned Parenthood clinic at an Operation Rescue-organized
demonstration. Police Lt. Dick Burns said protesters did not resist
arrest.
   About 35 to 50 counterprotesters also were at the clinic, Burns
said.
   Another Operation Rescue protest was held in Dallas, where 200
people rallied outside a clinic.
   One of the 20 protesters arrested on criminal trespass complaints
was Joan Elizabeth Andrews, who served 2{ years of a five-year
prison term in Florida after being arrested outside a Pensacola
clinic in March 1986.
   Protesters carried placards with photographs of dead fetuses and
slogans such as: ``Abortion is murder'' and ``I didn't know murder
was legalized.''
   In Chamblee, Ga., an Atlanta suburb, 40 people were taken into
custody after they formed a barricade at the doors of the Northside
Women's Clinic, police said. In all, the protesters there Saturday
numbered about 250.
   Chamblee Police Chief Reed Miller said officers carried the 40
protesters on stretchers to a paddy wagon and a bus. The protesters
were charged with interfering with a business. The misdemeanor
charge is punishable by up to $500 in fines or 30 days in jail.
   ``They were peaceful,'' Miller said. ``They blocked doors until
we had them removed.''
   In Indianapolis, the 13 protesters arrested outside Affiliated
Women's Services were charged with criminal trespassing, which
carries a maximum penalty of a year's in jail and a $5,000 fine.
   ``We had to physically carry them off, but they were very
cooperative,'' said Deputy Chief Mike Hoak of the Marion County
Sheriff's Department.
   Dozens of demonstrators affiliated with the Operation Rescue
gathered in the morning outside the clinic in an industrial park
near Indianapolis International Airport.

   The world's most secretive giant threw open its
borders last week to bare the pain of the Armenian earthquake and
let the world _ and the Soviet people _ help dig out victims from
under the rubble.
   Suddenly, Soviets were human. They were crying in grief,
agonizing over the crumbled concrete hiding their lost loved ones,
bleeding from their wounds.
   They had faces, unlike the thousands of unidentified Soviets
irradiated and uprooted under cover of a media blackout following
the Chernobyl nuclear power station explosion just two and a half
years ago.
   In opening the region to international relief workers, the Soviet
Union also gained $100 million in emergency aid, the official Soviet
news agency Tass said Saturday. It also saved thousands of lives
that would have been lost without French search dogs, Israeli
doctors and Belgian artificial kidney machines.
   The United States alone sent $6.6 million in assistance from both
government and private sources.
   It was the first time since World War II that international aid
has poured into the fiercely self-sufficient Soviet Union, and once
again it cracked the image of evil Western capitalists fostered by
decades of propaganda.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, thanking
the world for help last week, fondly recalled eating Spam, an
American canned meat product, during World War II. He said he still
considers it a delicacy.
   Foreign journalists, who normally must wait weeks or months for
permission to enter the country, flew in aboard relief planes and
were handed monthlong visas at the Moscow airport. Others went
straight to the stricken area without papers and weren't disturbed
by authorities, who ordinarily subject each new arrival to a
thorough document check.
   The government waived its requirement that Moscow-based
correspondents give 48 hours' notice and a detailed itinerary before
they leave the city, and it reopened Armenia, which had been closed
to foreign journalists since a renewed outbreak of ethnic violence
in November.
   Correspondents hitchhiked, explored and conducted interviews
wherever they chose. A foreign reporter caught rides with Soviet
troops.
   In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry, which now holds daily press
briefings but rarely provides news, gave regular updates on the
number of casualties and the state of the relief effort.
   In the same nation that covered up the deaths of more than
100,000 people in the Ashkhabad quake 40 years ago, the Soviet press
pounced on the story this time. The Tass news agency poured out
reams of copy and offered foreign agencies wrenching photographs of
the tragedy starting the day after the quake.
   Newspapers printed daily interviews with victims, rescuers and
even critics of the disorganization hampering the relief effort.
They printed articles with talk of shoddy construction practices
that caused concrete-slab buildings to collapse and contributed to
the huge death toll.
   Only hours before the quake destroyed most of three cities and
more than 100 rural villages, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told
the United Nations in New York that advances in mass media and
transportation were making the world ``more visible and tangible.''
   ``Today, the preservation of any kind of closed society is hardly
possible,'' said the leader of a nation that has tried for much of
its history to insulate itself from the outside.
   He did not know then that in a few hours he would have the
opportunity to demonstrate that belief.

   An elderly man despondent over his retarded
36-year-old daughter's illness shot her to death and turned the gun
on himself, neighbors and family members said.
   Police were still investigating the double shooting, but Police
Chief Warner T. Huston said it's ``a pretty clear case of a
homicide-suicide.''
   Edward DeYoung, a 73-year-old retired truck driver, and his
daughter, Annie, were found Thursday in the woman's bedroom. Each
had bullet wound in the head.
   Miss DeYoung lay in bed in her pajamas, a stuffed dog tucked in
her arms.
   ``It's sad that it happened, but I can understand why he did what
he did,'' said neighbor Peggy Barron, 39. ``He hated to see her
suffer. He loved her.''
   Miss DeYoung was discharged Wednesday from Christ Hospital in Oak
Lawn, where she was admitted Oct. 31 for treatment of a large tumor,
apparently non-cancerous, on her neck. Her father spent most of his
time with her at the hospital, as she went through surgery and tests.
   DeYoung took his daughter home the day before their bodies were
found, according to his grandson, James DeYoung Jr., 27. She was
depressed and not eating, he said.
   ``We had no hint something like this would happen,'' the grandson
said. ``Maybe Ed thought she was going to suffer.''
   DeYoung left a suicide note saying ``he was sorry, that God told
him this is what he had to do,'' said Huston.
   Dr. Mary Jumbelic of the Cook County medical examiner's office
said tests on the woman's body showed no signs of cancer, but that
she did have ``endocrine abnormalities.'' She said further tests
were being conducted.
   DeYoung's wife died more than 19 years ago and he cared for his
daughter with devotion and without complaint, neighbors said.
DeYoung said Miss DeYoung would help with the cooking and cleaning.
   ``Ed was always friendly, always joking, and that was unusual
considering what he might have been going through taking care of his
daughter,'' said Ms. Barron.
   ``He was very devoted to her and I know he did it out of love,''
she said.

<HEAD>Shamir Expresses Shock at U.S.-PLO Talks, Preparing Peace
Initiative</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with protest in Jerusalem, two Cabinet

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Saturday he
was shocked by Washington's decision to open a dialogue with the PLO
and announced he was preparing a new peace initiative to counter the
U.S. move.
   In downtown Jerusalem, thousands of right-wing Israelis and
Jewish settlers demonstrated to protest the new U.S. policy. Some
protesters later marched to the U.S. Consulate.
   ``We must break terrorism in the field and the state terrorism of
both the PLO and the United States,'' one speaker told protesters.
   Shamir's comments on Israel radio were the first by the
right-wing leader since Washington announced Wednesday it had ended
a ban on talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``It's not surprising that we were shocked by the (U.S.) decision
to talk with the organization which is our most radical enemy,'' he
said.
   Shamir said the U.S. move posed ``a very serious test'' to
Israel's alliance with Washington, the strongest supporter of the
Jewish state and the donor of $3 billion a year in foreign aid.
   In making the decision, the United States gave in to external and
internal pressures, Shamir said. He predicted U.S.-PLO dialogue will
fail when PLO chief Yasser Arafat is put to the test of halting
terrorism.
   He reiterated his staunch opposition to any dealings with the PLO.
   Shamir also confirmed earlier reports of his plan to announce a
new Middle East initiative after the formation of Israel's new
government. He declined to elaborate.
   Shamir's close ally in the right-wing Likud bloc, Cabinet
Minister Moshe Arens, said on the radio that Israel's next
government will discuss a unilateral move to grant Palestinians
limited self-rule, as envisioned in the 1978 U.S.-mediated Camp
David accord between Israel and Egypt.
   The PLO says it will settle only for an independent Palestinian
state. Egypt views the accord as outdated.
   Israel radio said two Labor Cabinet Ministers, Gad Yaakobi and
Moshe Shahal, plan to raise the autonomy issue at the Cabinet
meeting Sunday.
   The self-rule idea could bridge the gap between Likud and the
left-of-center Labor Party led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   The two main parties have been locked in complex coalition talks
since Israel's Nov. 1 parliament elections. They disagree sharply on
the issue of peace moves. Likud opposes conceding land captured in
1967, while Labor favors a territorial compromise in exchange for
peace.
   Peres and other Labor leaders, responding to the recent U.S.
decision to talk to the PLO, have proposed elections in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and talks with elected
Palestinian representatives as a substitute for the PLO.
   Shamir may include the idea in his autonomy program. Palestinian
notables in the occupied territories, however, reject moves that
would exclude the PLO.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a Labor Party member, said Friday
the U.S. decision on the PLO was ``a grave mistake, both regarding
terrorism and the possibility of open political talks.''
   The decision, he said, ``actually granted legitimacy to the
uprising in the territories,'' or the yearlong Palestinian revolt in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Since the uprising broke out Dec. 8,
329 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed.
   Demonstrators in front of the U.S. consulate lit candles and
waved signs that read: ``The United States gave a medal to the
killers of our children,'' and ``U.S.A., stay out!''
   The organizers said they later glued to the consulate door a
letter addressed to President Reagan accusing the United States of
``falling to its knees'' before the PLO.

   A gang member aiming at a member of a rival
gang opened fire inside a crowded mall, fatally wounding a
16-year-old bystander, police said Saturday.
   In other gang-related shootings, a reputed 27-year-old gang
member was killed while walking with his girlfriend and two
17-year-olds were wounded near the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
   Sergio Alpuche, 16, was shopping at a mall in Panorama City, 15
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, on Friday when he was hit
by a bullet intended for a San Fernando Valley gang member, police
Detective Paul Stewart said.
   Alpuche died at Holy Cross Medical Center on Saturday.
   The intended victim was fighting with a rival gang member among
the crowd of holiday shoppers when one of the rival's friends fired
a handgun, Stewart said. The gunman was in his early 20s, he added.
No arrests had been made by Saturday afternoon.
   Meanwhile, a reputed gang member strolling with his girlfriend
was gunned down by rivals at 11:20 p.m. Friday, said sheriff's
Deputy Roger Hom. The girlfriend was unharmed.
   Two carloads of gang members confronted Terrance Carl Kennedy as
he walked late Friday night in a southwest Los Angeles neighborhood
and one man shot Kennedy three times, sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom
said.
   Kennedy was pronounced dead 30 minutes later.
   The two youths wounded in the shooting near the Coliseum were hit
by the same bullet as they rode in the back seat of a car, police
said. They were both hospitalized in stable condition. The driver
and front-seat passenger were unhurt.

   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter on Saturday
rescued two pilots who were stranded four days on a remote Canadian
glacier after making an emergency landing in their vintage World War
II-era airplane.
   One of the pilots said they were tired but in good condition
after living on snacks, water and beer in the snowbound plane. The
vintage Grumman Widgeon amphibious plane was equipped with survival
gear.
   ``We both lost a little weight, but that's about it,'' said
Michael Mills.
   Whiteout conditions had prevented rescuers from getting to the
pilots during daily attempts that began Tuesday.
   Mills, 38, said in a telephone interview from his home that he
landed the plane after the engines failed. He and fellow pilot
Charles ``Buddy'' Ferguson, 31, were confident they would be
rescued, he said.
   ``We pretty much knew we were OK. We probably could have stayed
there another week without being in too bad a shape,'' Mills said.
   The two men had reported by radio earlier that they were unhurt
and comfortable, the Coast Guard said.
   The H-3 helicopter hoisted the men from the glacier about 10:20
a.m. AST and they were flown to their hometown of Gustavus, about 60
miles south, Chief Petty Officer Jim Van Atta said.
   The rescue was performed swiftly because of the danger, Coast
Guard Lt. Rick Ehret said. The helicopter hovered about 70 feet
above the ice as the men climbed, one at a time, into a basket.
   ``It was quite a demanding, difficult manuever since snow blows
up when you're hovering over something like that,'' Ehret said. ``It
creates whiteout conditions. It was very difficult for the pilot.''
   Ehret credited Mills and Ferguson for waiting out the storm and
advising rescuers to do the same. ``They could tell early on that
the weather wasn't getting any better,'' he said. ``They had cool
heads.''
   ``It just worked really well,'' said Ferguson. ``There weren't a
lot of questions and answers. You just do what you know you've got
to do.''
   The face of the glacier, at Tarr Inlet, is in Glacier Bay
National Park and Preserve and is about 60 miles north of Gustavus,
a small southeast Alaska port town. The huge river of ice stretches
far into British Columbia.
   Nightly temperatures on the glacier were estimated at 20 to 25
degrees, said Robert Jacobson, a National Weather Service
meteorologist in Juneau.
   The pilots were several miles inside Canada. Coast Guard
officials said they had received permission from the Canadian
government to conduct the rescue.
   Mills said he and Ferguson lived on cheese, salami, a bag of corn
chips and two cans of oysters. They rationed the food and had still
some left when they were rescued.
   ``We just nibbled. We drank plenty of water. We had a case of
beer and we drank that,'' he said. ``We really weren't that hungry
because we were so inactive.''
   ``We did well together. We had three magazines that we both read
about three different times, backwards and forwards,'' Mills said.
   Mills said the plane, which is being restored, was undamaged and
would be flown off the glacier later this week if the weather
permits.
   ``We're going to have to go up and get it,'' he said. ``It'll fly
right out of there. It's a great airplane.''
   Mills and Ferguson operate Alaska Seair Adventures, a
Gustavus-based company that transports anglers, hunters,
photographers and tourists to remote spots in southeast Alaska.
   Snowfall and poor visibility prevented the helicopter from
reaching the plane until the first break in the weather came
Saturday morning. Officials had kept in radio contact with the men
by repeatedly flying a C-130 transport plane over the glacier.
   ``The Coast Guard has been great,'' Mills said.

   A mild earthquake centered in the
Pacific Ocean south of this coastal community shook Southern
California on Saturday afternoon, but no injury or damage was
reported, officials said.
   The offshore tremor, which measured at 3.4 on the Richter scale,
struck at 3:46 p.m., said Robert Finn a spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   The epicenter was 4 miles south and slightly west of Seal Beach,
about 25 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, Finn said.
   ``We've received a few calls with people just inquiring,'' said
police dispatcher Beth Clarke. She said about 15 people called to
report they felt a jolting motion.
   Ms. Clarke said the quake was felt by officers in the station.
``It probably only lasted a couple of seconds,'' she added.
   The tremor also was felt by residents of Long Beach, another
coastal city about 20 miles south of Los Angeles.
   ``We've received about half a dozen calls from the public
reporting a quake,'' said Long Beach police Officer Billy Quach. ``I
did not feel the quake at all.''

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle and his family
leave Wednesday for a 12-day ski vacation in Colorado and will
finish their trip with a quick dash south for the Fiesta Bowl.
   Quayle, his wife Marilyn and their three children will fly from
Vail, Colo., to Tempe, Ariz., for the Jan. 2 game, said Quayle
spokesman David Beckwith.
   The Fiesta Bowl pits No. 1 Notre Dame against third-ranked West
Virginia, both 11-0. Kickoff is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. EST, making
it unlikely the Quayles will stay for the entire game.
   ``The kids have to get to school,'' Beckwith explained.
   Quayle, too, has plans for Jan. 3. His resignation from the
Senate takes effect that day and he is scheduled to walk his
successor, GOP Rep. Dan Coats, down the aisle to be sworn in.

   A moderate Lebanese militia on Saturday
surrounded pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists and forced them to
free three Irish U.N. peacekeeping troops kidnapped a day earlier in
south Lebanon.
   Also Saturday, PLO chief Yasser Arafat indicated he was involved
in the release a day earlier of a Swiss Red Cross official. A
leading Shiite cleric said he has given up trying to free 14 other
foreign hostages because his efforts have reached a ``dead end.''
   Lebanese police said the mainstream Shiite Moslem militia Amal
surrounded a house in the village of Sultaniyeh and forced about 20
men inside, belonging to the group Faithful Resistance, to surrender
and free the three Irish soldiers of the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon or UNIFIL.
   A police spokesman said the militia also conducted a sweep
rounding up 80 other members of Faithful Resistance, a small fanatic
affiliate of Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be the
umbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   Police sources said the Faithful Resistance kidnapped the Irish
soldiers Friday in retaliation for the Israeli detainment of a group
leader and other guerrillas.
   ``Amal summoned the Faithful Resistance's seven commanders
individually to a meeting to discuss the release of the Irish
soldiers and captured them when they refused to release peacekeepers
unconditionally. Their followers gave in a while later,'' said the
police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations.
   The house in Sultaniyeh was one mile southwest of Tibnin, where
the Irishmen were abducted. The 620-strong Irish batallion serving
with UNIFIL is headquartered in Tibnin, a village 13 miles north of
Israel which borders Israel's six-to-10-mile self-proclaimed
security zone.
   The police spokesman identified the three rescued Irish soldiers
as Corp. Patrick Maeken, 35, Pvt. Brian Kearney, 25, and Pvt. Bernak
McCarugmey, 30.
   UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel said Amal returned the three to
their command. ``They are in good shape,'' Goksel said in a
telephone interview.
   The abductions apparently were intended to retaliate for Israel's
seizure Thursday of Faithful Resistance guerrilla commander Jawad
Kasfi in Tibnin.
   The Israeli military command said Kasfi was linked to attacks on
Israeli army forces and an Israeli-backed militia, the South Lebanon
Army, since 1984.
   Red Cross worker Peter Winkler, 32, was freed Friday night in the
southern city of Sidon, where he was abducted Nov. 17. Police said
Winkler boarded a ferry Saturday at the Christian port of Jounieh,
heading for Cyprus. The Swiss Foreign Ministry earlier said Winkler
was to fly home via Cyprus Sunday.
   Arafat indicated Saturday he played a role in the release when he
was in Geneva last week to address the United Nations.
   ``When I was in Geneva, the chief of the Red Cross asked me to
help release the Swiss employee, and he has been released,'' Arafat
said without elaborating. He spoke shortly after his arrival in
Tunis, Tunisia, where the Palestine Liberation Organization is
headquartered.
   In Bern, Swiss Foreign Minister Rene Felber said Saturday that
talks between a Swiss official and Arafat proved ``useful.''
   Felber said Winkler's captors tried to tie his release to a
lenient sentence for a jailed Lebanese plane hijacker, Hussein
Hariri, but Switzerland refused any concessions.
   He said that in indirect contacts, the kidnappers identified
themselves as members of a dissident Palestinian group named
``Organization of Socialist Revolution.''
   An official of the all-Swiss International Committee of the Red
Cross said the humanitarian agency will negotiate safety guarantees
with ``various parties and groups'' in Lebanon before resuming full
activities there.
   The delegation, cut nearly in half after Winkler was kidnapped,
will be brought back to its original size of 30 as soon as possible,
said the official at ICRC headquarters in Geneva, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Winkler's release leaves 14 foreigners, including nine Americans,
missing and presumed kidnapped by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon.
   Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The Beirut daily Al-Liwaa quoted Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah
Saturday as saying, ``I have suspended my initiative on behalf of
the hostages because it reached a dead end.''
   Fadlallah, the spiritual guide of Hezbollah, did not elaborate.

   Soviet-born cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played in
a charity concert for Armenian earthquake victims Saturday night
after postponing a visit to India to take part in the event.
   ``It was very important for me to take part in this concert,''
the 61-year-old musician said before a last-minute rehearsal with
flutist James Galway, conductor Andre Previn and other musicians who
rearranged their schedules and donated time to perform.
   Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife,
Princess Diana, attended the sell-out concert at the 2,026-seat
Barbican Hall in London.
   The event was part of an effort called ``Musicians for Armenia,''
which was expected to raise $452,000 from donations worldwide,
including gifts from musicians, concert proceeds and film and
recording rights.
   The British Association of Concert Agents organized the appeal to
aid some of the thousands of survivors from the killer earthquake
Dec. 7 that killed an estimated 55,000 people.
   The Soviet Union and five other nations televised the late-night
performance. The British Broadcasting Corp.'s world service
rearranged its radio programming to allow its estimated audience of
25 million to hear the concert live.
   ``At the moment, with what has happened, I feel that all
Armenians are my relatives,'' said Rostropovich, a U.S. citizen of
Armenian descent who is conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra
in Washington.
   On Friday, Rostropovich, one of the most famous cellists in
history, gave his first solo concert in Britain in nearly two
decades, also in aid of Armenia.
   Previn, who conducted the English Chamber Orchestra during the
concert Saturday, said before the program that it was ``amazing''
the musicians were able to join.
   ``In our business everyone's booked up for the next two or three
years,'' he said. ``It was just good fortune that everyone could
make it at such short notice.''
   ``This terrible catastrophe has provoked the best qualities in
people,'' said Rostropovich.
   The cellist played Villa-Lobos' Bachianas Brasileiras No. 1, then
turned to the piano to accompany his Soviet-born wife, soprano
Galina Vishnevskaya, in works by Tchaikovsky.
   The program also included Galway playing Debussy's Syrinx and
Previn conducting the English Chamber Orchestra in Beethoven's
Coriolan Overture.
   Soviet pianist Andrei Gavrilov, whose family in Armenia escaped
injury in the quake, played Mozart and Chopin.
   The musicians also included violist Yuri Bashmet, pianist Barry
Douglas and violinist Cho-Liang Lin.
   The Times reported that the concert was to be televised in Spain,
the Netherlands, Ireland, Australia, Belgium and the Soviet Union.
   Musicians, organizers, concert hall workers, program printers and
other staff donated their services so that all income could go to
the British Red Cross Armenian Earthquake Appeal fund. Tickets cost
$45, $27 and $18.

   A crew planning to take durable, plastic
tents to earthquake victims in Soviet Armenia got word Saturday that
a Soviet military cargo plane will carry them to the disaster site,
the group's leader said.
   The 17-member team is scheduled to leave Sunday, said Anthony
Seraphin, president of Protect-A-Boat and Film Applicators of North
America, the Springfield, Pa., company that came up with the idea
for the quick-to-build shelters.
   ``As far as we know, we're ready to go,'' he said, but added that
he'll ``believe it when we're on the plane.''
   There was no immediate word on when the plane would return to the
Soviet Union with materials it has picked up in other U.S. cities.
   Soviet officials estimate 55,000 lives were lost and 500,000
people were left homeless by the Dec. 7 quake. After hearing of the
massive displacement, Seraphin came up with the idea of using the
film for tents.
   Construction techniques require building frames out of steel and
then shrink-wrapping them with resin-based plastic using a propane
heat gun. Seraphin said a tent that can house 30 people takes about
two hours to build and includes doors, windows and vents.
   The arrival of the Soviet plane would end two days of frustration
for Seraphin and the Washington, D.C.-based Armenia Relief Society.
   ``In the past two days, I would `guesstimate' that we've
contacted close to 100 people from the secretary of state on down to
business people with contacts,'' Seraphin said, adding he had talked
to people in Washington, New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, Maryland
and Florida.
   Earlier in the week, the Air National Guard offered to fly the
group, if Seraphin received permission from the Defense Department.
On Friday, the Defense Department said that the State Department
would have to approve the trip.
   ``Everybody wanted to be very helpful, but no one seemed able to
break through,'' Seraphin said. ``We just had to break through the
red tape.''
   The team intends to go from town to town in the quake area,
building five to 10 shelters and teaching the residents how to build
more for themselves.
   ``Then when we get back, we'll be raising money to send more
material over there so they can do it themselves,'' said Seraphin.
   The group had not made plans for their return as of Saturday.

   Striking workers at a government-owned
uranium-processing plant voted overwhelmingly Saturday to approve a
partial contract settlement with the company that operates the
facility, a spokesman said.
   The settlement will allow 625 workers, who have been on strike
since Oct. 7, to return to work Monday, said plant spokesman Pete
Kelley. However, about 250 of the workers lost their jobs last week
to layoffs resulting from decreased production demands.
   Kelley said members of 14 unions represented by the Fernald
Atomic Trades and Labor Council approved the agreement by a 3-to-1
ratio.
   Production at the plant in Fernald, 18 miles northwest of
Cincinnati, formally known as the Feed Materials Production Center,
has been halted since the strike began. The plant, owned by the U.S.
Department of Energy, processes uranium the government uses in
nuclear weapons.
   Since the strike, the plant has become embroiled in controversy
following the DOE's admission that radioactive material leaked into
the environment over a 30-year period.
   The Energy Department has pledged itself to a massive cleanup,
and recent reports indicate the department is considering closing
the facility altogether.
   The striking workers met Friday and heard details of the proposed
settlement.
   When they struck in October, union leaders said the dispute was
not over wages but over fringe benefits and retirement programs.
They said the company wanted workers to pay more for benefits.
   The agreement includes a new health insurance program, but no pay
increase.
   Under the agreement, workers can return to work and pursue up to
4,000 safety and health grievances.
   Kendell McIntyre, a worker at the plant who has received his
layoff notice, said he voted to accept the contract so he could
receive his severance benefits.
   ``I've already received my order saying I'd be let go. I voted
for it so I can take the money I'm entitled to, get out and find
another job,'' McIntyre said.

   The USS Tennessee, the first
nuclear-powered submarine to fire the powerful new Trident 2
missiles, was commissioned into the nation's fleet Saturday.
   The nation's ninth Trident submarine was hailed as a weapon
``fitted for the demands of modern peace,'' by former U.S. Sen.
Howard Baker, who along with other Tennessee and Navy dignitaries
were in a crowd of about 1,200 who braved bitter cold to celebrate
the submarine's formal entry into the fleet.
   Nearly 100 anti-nuclear weapons protesters gathered outside the
gates of the Naval Underwater Systems Center where the commissioning
was held. No protesters were arrested, police said.
   Members of the Coalition to Stop the Trident had threatened a
large demonstration and acts of civil disobedience. Authorities
responded by assigning more than 80 police officers to the
ceremonies, according to New London Police Sgt. Kenneth Edwards.
   The Tennessee is the first nuclear-powered submarine designed to
fire potent Trident 2 missiles. The missiles have a range of 6,000
miles, and each multiple warhead can strike up to 10 targets.
   The missile continues to undergo tests, the latest of which was
successfully completed Friday at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The Tenessee also is the first vessel to be assigned to the
Navy's newest Trident submarine base at Kings Bay, Ga. The other
Trident base is in Washington state.
   Baker, a former Republican senator from Tenessee and more
recently White House chief of staff, was the keynote speaker. U.S.
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter also
attended the ceremonies.
   ``Ours is a hard and bitter peace of which President Kennedy
spoke, a peace guaranteed only by our strength, unquestioned and
unsurpassed,'' Baker said.
   ``The mission of the Tennessee we commission today is to keep
that peace,'' he said.
   Tridents are the Navy's largest and most powerful weapon. They
are 560 feet long and displace 18,700 tons when submerged. Each has
24 missiles and a crew of more than na 150.
   The Tennessee, the sixth U.S. or Confederate vessel to bear the
state's name, was built at the Electric Boat shipyard, a subsidiary
of General Dynamics Corp.
   At the Trident submarine base in Bangor, Wash., on Saturday,
about 120 people held a vigil to protest the commissioning a
continent away of the Tennessee, and its capability of firing
Trident 2 missiles.
   The eight Trident submarines at Bangor, about 15 miles west of
Seattle, will be converted to hold Trident 2 missiles within the
next few years, said Renee Krisko of Ground Zero Center for
Nonviolent Action, the group that organized the vigil. She said a
vigil also was held at the base in Kings Bay, Ga., where the USS
Tennessee will be assigned.

<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Saturday he
would do his best to prevent Palestinian terrorist attacks but could
not guarantee that some militants wouldn't step out of line.
   Palestinian leaders said the PLO used its first official meeting
with the United States Friday to assure Washington it will pressure
its followers to refrain from terrorism.
   ``We will do all our best to stop all this (terrorism),'' Arafat
told reporters after returning to his headquarters in Tunis.
   In an apparent reference to some radical Palestinian factions
that oppose his strategies, the PLO chief said he could not
guarantee that ``one person here or one individual there'' might not
resort to terrorism.
   ``Give me one example of any ruler who can have complete control
with all the groups,'' he said.
   The PLO serves as an umbrella organization for eight different
guerrilla factions which constitute the Palestinians' military arm.
The main group is Arafat's Fatah, but other PLO factions backed by
Syria mount operations against Israel and its embassies abroad. The
factions sometimes fight each other.
   The PLO, bankrolled by the 21 member states of the Arab League,
has representatives in about 100 countries.
   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman added: ``We will use all our
efforts and all our influence on our people all over the world not
to involve or engage in any operation against civilians, innocent
people or Americans.''
   Arafat's renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel's
right to exist led the U.S. government on Wednesday to drop its ban
on contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization and to open
``a substantive dialogue'' with the group.
   In another boost for the PLO, Algeria accepted the credentials of
the first ambassador of the newly declared state of Palestine, the
Algerian government news agency said. In Friday's report based on a
Foreign Ministry statement, the ambassador was identified as Moudher
Dadjani.
   Arafat described Friday's 90-minute meeting between the U.S.
ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., and a four-member
PLO delegation as a ``step in the right direction'' toward a ``just
and comprehensive settlement.''
   ``No peace can be settled without their (U.S.) participation and
their efforts,'' he said at a brief news conference.
   Arafat said the PLO's main priority in the talks is to push for
an early convening of an international peace conference on the
Middle East. U.S. officials say an international conference is no
substitute for direct Arab-Israeli talks.
   Abdul-Rahman charged Israel was trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO
contacts by using deadly force against Palestinians. ``The Israeli
government is trying to sabotage this dialogue, to stop it,'' he
said.
   He said PLO officials had raised this issue in the talks Friday
and urged the U.S. government to pressure Israel to halt the use of
deadly force against the yearlong Palestinian uprising in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, in which more than 320 Palestinians and 13
Israelis have been killed.
   Arafat also condemned killings in the occupied territories,
terming them a ``continuation of state terrorism.''
   Abdel-Rahman said the PLO has tightened security measures in
recent days for fear of possible attacks by the Israeli secret
services.
   He said the next round of talks would be held after
President-elect George Bush takes office Jan. 20.
   He said that at the next sessions, the PLO will seek a ``common
understanding'' with the Americans on the issue of an international
conference, Palestinian statehood and withdrawal of Israeli forces
from the occupied territories.
   ``We will not have results or solutions in one day,''
Abdul-Rahman said. ``It's not like a knockout in boxing. We must go
point-by-point.'
   Last month in Algeria, the PLO proclaimed an independent state,
without specifying its borders. U.S. officials have said the opening
of a dialogue with the PLO does not represent recognition of the
state.
   The PLO spokesman, giving a detailed account of Friday's talks,
said the Americans outlined their attitude toward terrorism and
emphasized that any PLO terrorism would derail the dialogue.
   U.S. Embassy officials on Saturday declined comment on the talks,
saying any further comment would come from the State Department in
Washington.
   Abdul-Rahman said the Palestinian delegates emphasized their
opposition to individual, group and state terrorism.
   ``We will urge all Palestinians individuals and all Palestinian
organizations to adopt this strategy for peace,'' he said. ``No one
has the right to violate this Palestinian strategy. Any mistake from
our side will deteriorate the whole dialogue with the Americans.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry on Saturday said
the United States is trying to maintain a military presence in
Panama into the next century in spite of the Panama Canal treaties.
   In Washington, a State Department spokesman said the United
States intends to abide by the treaties.
   The Panamanian government statement, issued in Panama City, said:
``The Foreign Ministry has been following the development of a
unilateral thesis in the U.S. State Department under which the
neutrality treaty would allow a limited U.S. military presence in
Panama past Dec. 31, 1999.''
   The Panama Canal treaties, signed by President Carter and
Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos in 1977, stipulate that on Dec. 31,
1999, ``only the Republic of Panama will operate the canal and
maintain military forces, defense sites and military installations
inside national territory.''
   The Panamanian Foreign Ministry said the U.S. intention to remain
in Panama after 1999 is ``one of the main reasons for the economic
aggression and the threatening use of force against Panama.''
   Asked about Panama's charges, State Department spokesman Dennis
Harter in Washington said, ``It's not the first time they've said
anything like that. They've said it fairly frequently.
   ``We intend to abide by the Panama Canal treaties,'' he added in
an interview with The Associated Press. ``We have been and we intend
to continue to.''
   The United States imposed economic sanctions on Panama earlier
this year and expanded its military force along the canal in an
effort to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to step down.
   Noriega, head of the armed forces and de facto leader of Panama,
is under U.S. indictment on charges of drug trafficking and money
laundering. He denies the accusations.
   The Foreign Ministry statement alluded to a document issued last
week by Army's Southern Command saying that after 1999 ``the United
States will continue showing its determination to support the
neutrality and operation of the Panama Canal as well as regional and
U.S. security interests.''
   The Southern Command report said the U.S. Defense Department
approved ``a preliminary plan for an orderly, phased withdrawal from
Panama,'' but it did not give specific withdrawal dates. It also
said the Southern Command now operating along the banks of the
Panama Canal will not be eliminated when U.S. military presence ends
in Panama. However, it did not say where the Southern Command will
be located.
   The U.S. Army has about 13,000 troops assigned to the Southern
Command, about 3,000 of whom arrived in March to add pressure on
Noriega.

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Warns of Further Weapons Plant Shutdowns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department may have to shut more
nuclear weapons facilities because President Reagan is not proposing
enough money to operate them in accordance with safety and
environmental laws, the Washington Post said in its Sunday editions.
   The newspaper cited a letter in which Energy Secretary John S.
Herrington warned the administration that the proposed 1990 budget
fell short by $360 million.
   ``I must in good conscience advise you that ... the system will,
in all likelihood, be operating beyond the bounds of acceptable
risk,'' Herrington said in the Dec. 9 letter to White House chief of
staff Kenneth M. Duberstein.
   Spokespersons for the Energy Department and the White House were
not available for comment after the story appeared.
   According to the Post, the letter contains a detailed assessment
of the Energy Department's budgetary problems, which Herrington said
may require choosing between upgrading plant safety and meeting the
Defense Department's production goals for nuclear materials.
   If the department gives priority to production goals, the paper
quoted Herrington, ``then unresolved environmental and safety issues
are likely to lead to further shutdowns in the weapons complex.''
   Herrington's letter cites years of budget austerity combined with
the Reagan military buildup that put more demands on the system.
   ``Part of today's problem stems from our attempts to stretch,
defer and absorb budgetary shortfalls, hoping that next year things
would be better and we could catch up,'' the Post quoted Herrington.
   ``As a result, the country's ability to produce and maintain a
nuclear weapons stockpile is in serious jeopardy,'' Herrington said
in the letter. ``The risk is great that without a significant
increase in resources over the next five years, we will no longer be
able to sustain a strong nuclear deterrent in which we have invested
$57 billion since 1980.''
   The Energy Department, which operates 17 weapons plants, has
proposed spending $50 billion in the next 20 years to build new
facilities and correct the most pressing environmental problems.
   Herrington told Duberstein his department would pay for $200
million in upgrades at its Savannah River plants, in South Carolina,
by using the last of a contingency fund. He said the action will
reduce the fund ``to zero'' and leave no cushion for emergencies.
   In addition, the department has said it will help clear up a
nuclear waste problem endangering the operation of the Denver-area
Rocky Flats Plant, which handles plutonium.
   Herrington's letter, according to the Post, indicated the
department is in line for a $900 million budget increase next year _
more than 8 percent higher than its current $12 billion budget. The
secretary said the problems at Savannah River and Rocky Flats will
result in a $360 million shortfall, according to the Post.

<TEXT>
   A Navy F-14 Tomcat jet
fighter landing at Alameda Naval Station crashed into another F-14
on a runway, veering off into the 12-foot deep Oakland Estuary.
   The pilot and a radar officer ejected from the plane Friday
before it hit the water on and were rescued apparently unhurt, but
were hospitalized for possible shock, officials said.
   On Saturday, the fighter was lifted from the waterway, damaged
but in one piece, by a huge crane. It was taken to a nearby pier at
the Alameda Naval Air Station, said Navy spokesman Bill Valente.
Earlier, officials had said they thought the plane had shattered on
impact.
   The $30 million jet, the type featured in the hit movie ``Top
Gun,'' crashed on the north end of the air station's north-south
runway. The air station is located on the eastern side of San
Francisco Bay.
   One crew member was rescued about half an hour later by a passing
tugboat and the second by a Coast Guard rescue boat, said Coast
Guard Lt. Michael Sullivan.
   Two F-14s landed without incident before a third plane struck the
second one and veered into the estuary, Valente said. The planes
were from Miramar Naval Air Station north of San Diego, he added.
   The two crew members in the second plane, which remained on the
runway, walked away from the crash, unhurt, Valente said. The plane
lost part of its right wing, but officials said they hadn't
determined the cost of damage or whether the plane could be repaired.
   The F-14 is a large and powerful aircraft that in 1972 became the
standard fleet fighter aboard aircraft carriers at sea.
   Visible damage to the aircraft after it was pulled from the water
included a missing hatch and part of the nose, officials said.

<HEAD>Another Crack Found in Reactor at Troubled Savannah River Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small crack has been discovered in a cooling
pipe at a reactor at the Savannah River Plant nuclear facility, but
it should not affect next summer's scheduled restart of the reactor,
Energy Department officials said Saturday.
   Len Sjostrom, the Department of Energy's acting assistant manager
for reactor operations, said that the crack in the 4-inch pipe
occurred in a weld area where two pipes join, the Augusta (Ga.)
Chronicle reported in Sunday's editions.
   The pipe supplies cooling water to reactor control rods, which
are raised and lowered within the reactor vessel to control the
fission process.
   Sjostrom said the crack was detected Friday by ultrasonic tests
during a routine check of the reactor's piping. He said he thought
this was the first crack found in the reactor's piping this year.
   All three SRP reactors _ known as the K, L and P reactors _ have
been shut down since summer for safety upgrades and maintenance.
They are the nation's only source of tritium, a radioactive gas used
to boost the power of nuclear weapons.
   Because tritium decays 5.5 percent annually, some federal
officials say the nation could face forced reductions in nuclear
weapons unless the reactors are restarted soon.
   In Washington, Richard W. Starostecki, the Energy Department's
deputy assistant secretary for safety, health and quality assurance,
said he was sending a team of experts to the weapons plant next week
to assess the situation, The New York Times reported in Sunday's
editions.
   Sjostrom said replacing the pipe would not delay restart
``because we have the time to do it ... and especially because it's
a smaller pipe.''
   The K Reactor crack was discovered the same day Energy Department
officials said a separate crack found earlier in the L Reactor
presented no major safety problems and could have been caused by
nearby welding.
   Sections of pipe are replaced when a crack penetrates more than
50 percent of a pipe wall's thickness, or covering more than 20
percent of the pipe's circumference.
   The L Reactor pipe was removed under that rule, and the pipe in
the K reactor found cracked Friday will be replaced even though it
does not meet the criteria, the Augusta paper reported.

pro-Iranian guerrillas in south Lebanon.
   Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross worker kidnapped one month ago was
freed by his captors and said before heading home today that he was

Nov. 17.
   The abduction of the Irish soldiers occurred Friday in Tibnin, a

   Rescuers found 21 people alive in Spitak

earthquake, and officials said the discovery persuaded them to
extend the search for survivors.
   An Armenian official told a Politburo commission overseeing
rescue operations that of the 135 people pulled from ruins, 21 were
saved. His report was shown on Soviet television Friday night.
   ``In Leninakan 110 were pulled out, and 20 were alive. In Spitak,
only one was alive,'' said the official, who was not identified. He
said the survivors were found Thursday.
   The discovery of one person still alive in Spitak spurred

   Political maverick Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
says his conviction of tax and mail fraud conspiracy is ``a wrong,
gross, disgusting, obscene miscarriage of justice,'' and predicted
he will die a martyr's death if sent to prison.
   ``They don't want a living political martyr in prison, they want
a dead one,'' said LaRouche, claiming he was the victim of a hate
campaign by the news media and a frameup by a pro-Soviet ``friends
of glasnost'' clique in the Justice and State departments.
   After less than 12 hours of deliberation, a federal trial jury on
Friday found LaRouche and six associates guilty of mail fraud and
conspiracy for raising more than $30 million in loans from
supporters without any intention of repaying them.
   In addition, LaRouche was convicted of scheming to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses paid by
various corporations he controls and claiming he had no taxable
income. Government prosecutors said LaRouche has not filed federal
income tax returns for any year since 1978.

   The $516 million-per-plane pricetag for the B-2
stealth bomber makes it the most expensive aircraft ever built, but
Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge says whatever the
radar-evading plane costs, it's worth it.
   The stealth bomber, which resembles a huge, tailless manta ray,
is expected to make its first flight early next year but will not be
ready for wartime use until 1992 at the earliest, Aldridge said
Friday.
   Aldridge told a news conference the design, development and
construction of 132 planes was expected to cost $68.1 billion by the
time production ends in mid-1995.
   Expressed in terms of the original estimate, the price tag has
grown from $36.6 billion to $42.5 billion in fiscal 1981 dollars _
an increase of about 16 percent, Aldridge said. Those figures do not
reflect cost increases caused by inflation since 1981 or that
projected in future years.

   A Vietnam war veteran has been selected as lead
trial prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case against fellow former
Marine and ex-White House aide Oliver L. North.
   John W. Keker, 44, who like North was wounded while leading a
Marine infantry platoon in action, was chosen on Friday by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to head a three-lawyer team
that will try North.
   Walsh had said he would like to try the North case himself. But
he said in a statement Friday that he would continue to deal with
problems posed by a wealth of classified documents and supervise the
continuing investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Walsh's spokesman, James Wieghart, said Keker's war record, which
was not mentioned in the statement, was coincidental to his being
