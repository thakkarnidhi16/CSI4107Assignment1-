<HEAD>Suit Against Talk Show Host Charges Sexual Harassment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $4 million lawsuit claiming sexual
harassment and discrimination was filed Thursday against John J.
McLaughlin, the talk show host and Washington editor of National
Review magazine.
   The plaintiff, Linda D. Dean, 35, of Alexandria, Va., was
executive assistant at McLaughlin's Oliver Productions, which
produces his syndicated talk show, ``The McLaughlin Group,'' from
December 1987 until April 15 of this year.
   The U.S. District Court suit alleged that McLaughlin fired her
from her $35,000-a-year job in ``retaliation for her protests of
sex discrimination and sexual harassment toward herself and other
women'' who worked in the office.
   McLaughlin, 60, has been married since 1975 to Labor Secretary
Ann Dore McLaughlin.
   Dean's suit seeks $1 million in compensatory damages from
McLaughlin and Oliver Productions jointly and $1.5 million in
punitive damages from each defendant.
   McLaughlin's attorney, former White House counsel Fred Fielding,
said in a statement: ``John McLaughlin and Oliver Productions
emphatically deny these bizarre and outrageous allegations, and
will seek swift disposition of this matter through the judicial
system. We will have no further public comment on these allegations
or on the possible motivations of the plaintiff until that time.''

   More than 200 members of a ``New Age'' sect chanted in an
attempt to command one of several forest fires in Yellowstone
National Park away from their Montana property as 300 firefighters
battled the blaze.
   Hundreds of firefighters also were busy Wednesday with wildfires
in Wyoming, Colorado, Oregon and Idaho, including a 2,300-acre
blaze that came within a few miles of Idaho's Capitol in Boise.
   Yellowstone's 16,600-acre Fan fire has been burning for nearly a
month, but firefighters weren't called in until Monday, when stiff
winds pushed it within a third of a mile of the 12,000-acre ranch
in southern Montana.
   ``We don't want our fires to burn on private property,'' park
spokesman Steve Iobst said Wednesday as crews fought the
16,600-acre fire near the Church Universal and Triumphant's Royal
Teton Ranch bordering Yellowstone.
   Aircraft bombed the blaze with fire retardant as more than 200
church members chanted at high speed in a meadow not far from the
flames, commanding the fire to reverse its course.
   Park officials felt the fire would stay inside America's oldest
national park, Iobst said.
   Church officials have criticized the National Park Service's
policy of generally letting fires burn unless they threaten
buildings or private property. Church leader Elizabeth Clare
Prophet said Yellowstone officials should have known the Fan fire
threatened church property and started fighting it sooner.
   The 30-year-old church, which has its international headquarters
Paradise Valley in nearby Corwin Springs, owns more than 33,000
acres in the area, including the ranch. Church members believe in
using praying or chanting to influence world conditions or personal
concerns.
   In Idaho, officials hoped today to control a 2,300-acre fire in
the Boise Foothills, which came within a few miles of the Capitol
on Wednesday.
   The blaze burned tinder-dry cheatgrass and brush before 120
firefighters aided by air tankers and helicopters slowed it. The
fire was man-caused, said U.S. Forest Service Fire Information
Officer Jean Hawthorne.
   Fire bosses had hoped to mop up the blaze Wednesday evening, but
it jumped fire lines into dry brush and scorched 15 more acres
before crews could stop it again, Forest Service fire information
officer Jean Hawthorne said.

   America's obsession with youth culture

adult population, says a Christian education director.
   Maryann J. Dotts of the Cape Coral, Fla., United Methodist

increasing three times faster than any other age group.

   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America says
that none of three seminarians who publicly declared their
homosexuality last year will be recommended for ordination in the
5.3 million-member denomination.
   It said two of them, Jim Lascaster of Westminster, Calif, and
Joel Working of Walcott, N.D., were ruled out because they would
not pledge compliance with a policy allowing only non-practicing
homosexuals to be ordained.
   The third, Jeff Johnson of Lancaster, Calif., was excluded after
he told his bishop he would comply with the celibacy requirement
and would resign if that situation changed.
   Bishop Lyle Miller of San Francisco said that Johnson's
statement of compliance was ``conditional and temporary and
therefore not consistent with the spirit of the abstinence
requirement.''
   Miller said Johnson ``is a person of honesty and Christian
faith,'' but differences between his position and church policy
were ``too significant to allow for recommendation.''

<HEAD>Leftists Say Three Members Organizing US Base Protests Disappeared</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leftist group said today that three
members who were organizing protests against U.S. military bases
disappeared in what it charged was a military plot to stifle
dissent.
   Zenaida Uy, secretary-general of the New Patriotic Alliance,
said Jose-Marie Enriquez left his home in Quezon City on Wednesday
to visit a shopping mall but never returned.
   Ms. Uy said Alejandrino Sarile left a meeting in suburban Makati
to change clothes but never reached his home.
   The third, Benedicto Clotario, was dropped off in Makati last
Sunday after attending a meeting in Cavite province and has not
been seen since, she said.
   She said checks of hospitals, morgues and police stations failed
to turn up any trace of the three.
   ``We believe that these incidents are part of a systematic
national campaign of terror being waged by the military or
paramilitary groups as part of a national policy of repression and
violence against organized groups,'' the alliance said in a
statement.
   It said the abductions were an attempt to prevent rallies
protesting the government of President Corazon Aquino.
   ``Because public opinion is snowballing against the Aquino
government's subservient and mendicant conduct in the bases review
talks, the present regime wants to paralyze resisting organizations
in their campaign machinery so that they can easily force the
decision to extend the bases stay on the Philippines and subvert
the will of the people,'' the statement said.
   Last September, the alliance's national chairman, Lean
Alejandro, was slain and his killers remain unknown. Leftists have
accused right-wing groups of mounting a liquidation campaign
against members of legal left-wing organizations.
   In July, the American Bar Association expressed concern in a
letter to Mrs. Aquino over recent killings of human rights lawyers
who also were alliance members.
   Meanwhile, the United States and the Philippines today continued
talks on the status of the six bases. They broke down July 26
because of differences over compensation but resumed on Tuesday.
   On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said the
Philippines would welcome the inclusion of debt relief as part of
the compensation package the United States has to pay for the use
of its bases here.
   The United States gives the Philippines $180 million in military
and economic aid each year in exchange for the use of Clark Air
Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller facilities here.
   The talks are part of negotiations that began four months ago to
review a 1947 agreement giving the Americans the right to operate
military bases in the Philippines.

   Surprising the judge and prosecutors, a
man decided at the last moment to plead guilty to first-degree
murder in the death of a former boarder whose decomposing head was
found buried in his backyard.
   After the plea Wednesday, Jackson County Circuit Judge Alvin C.
Randall sentenced Robert Berdella to life in prison without
probation or parole for the August 1987 murder of Larry W. Pearson,
20, of Wichita, Kan.
   Berdella, 39, a Kansas City flea market merchant, has been in
custody since April on sex charges after another man told police he
had been held captive and tortured at Berdella's home.
   The guilty plea, which came after a late-morning recess in an
arraignment hearing on the murder charge filed July 21, appeared to
surprise the judge, who stared at one of Berdella's attorneys,
assistant county public defender Pat Berrigan.
   Pat Hall, the assistant prosecutor assigned to the case, also
wore a stunned expression. After a pause, the judge insisted that
Berdella confess under oath.
   ``I put a plastic bag over his head and tied it with rope and
allowed him to suffocate,'' Berdella said when questioned by one of
his attorneys. Asked if he did it deliberately, Berdella answered,
``Yes.''
   A second skull, found in Berdella's bedroom closet, has been
identified as that of Robert A. Sheldon, a 23-year-old California
man. No charges have been brought in connection with Sheldon.
   Analysis of Pearson's skull showed that the fifth vertebra, from
just above the base of his neck, had been cut several times by a
saw. The cuts were made ``while the deceased was still alive or
shortly after death,'' according to court documents.
   Police seized two circular saws, a hacksaw, a miter saw, a
disassembled jigsaw, 14 jigsaw blades, knives, scissors and
clippers from Berdella's house, according to search warrants.
   Jackson County Prosecutor Albert Riederer said later that
Berdella's guilty plea was ``not a total surprise, in the sense
that we talked about it several weeks ago.'' Riederer said the
discussions were with other prosecuting attorneys, not Berdella's
attorneys.
   Barbara Schenkenberg, one of Berdella's attorneys, said Berdella
had been considering the guilty plea since he was first charged.
   Police went through Berdella's house, finding more than 200
sexually explicit photographs, and dug up his back yard in an
extensive search.
   Hall said the guilty plea was ``in the best interest of our
client, the people of the state of Missouri.''
   Berdella was also charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy,
one of felonious restrain and one of assault in the case of the man
who accused of him of torture.

   A PLO official says the organization is
still trying to sort out the significance of King Hussein's
decision to sever legal ties with the West Bank but is treating the
move as a positive step.
   But the official expressed skepticism about the Jordanian
monarch's intention, saying the king might be trying to pressure
Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territory into reliance on
Jordan.
   ``We are dealing with it on the basis it is a positive step on
the part of Jordan,'' the senior PLO official, who insisted he not
be identified further, said Wednesday.
   ``Also we are dealing with it on the basis of removing from our
minds the Jordanian intentions behind this step _ whether it is
pressure or not,'' he added, echoing doubts expressed by other PLO
officials meeting in Baghdad.
   The official indicated Jordan's action might prompt new PLO
diplomatic activity. He said it has ``accelerated Palestinian
thinking regarding realistic political initiatives,'' but declined
to specify what steps might be taken.
   Hussein announced Sunday he was severing administrative and
legal ties with the West Bank, which his family ruled from 1948
until Israel seized it in 1967. He said he is stepping aside in
favor of the PLO and called for an independent Palestinian state.
   In keeping with that decision, the Jordanian government today
announced it was laying off or retiring as of Aug. 16 more than
21,000 Jordanian employees of Palestinian origin working in the
West Bank.
   The PLO official attributed Hussein's decision to cut ties to
the 8-month-old uprising, during which ``Jordanian institutions in
the occupied territories were rendered valueless.''
   Jordan is the primary financial avenue for the 800,000 West Bank
Palestinians. Most hold Jordanian passports and many receive
Jordanian salaries.
   A PLO communique issued here after several days of talks by the
PLO Central Council said the 66 members on hand discussed Jordan's
action ``which was taken without any consulation with the
organization.''
   It urged the cabinet-like Executive Committee ``to study all the
aspects and the expected results of the Jordanian measures and to
take all necessary measures.''
   It neither praised nor criticized Jordan's action.
   The senior PLO official said Hussein's action ``canceled the
Jordanian option'' advocated by some American and Israeli officials
who favor returning the West Bank to Jordan in exchange for peace
rather than allowing a Palestinian state.
   ``It put the Americans and the Israelis face-to-face with the
Palestinians,'' the PLO official said.
   He also said it should lead to a renewed PLO agreement with
Jordan ``because we are still committed to the idea of a
confederation'' between a Jordanian and Palestinian state.
   The Central Council called for an extraordinary session of the
Palestine National Council to discuss the Jordanian action as well
as the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   The national council is the PLO's parliament.
   A PLO delegation will visit Jordan soon to discuss the issue and
prepare for a visit by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, whose relations
with Jordan have been strained since Hussein broke off talks with
him in mid-1986.

   A judge sentenced a former state highway
patrolman to 25 years to life in prison for strangling a motorist
and throwing her body off a 65-foot-high bridge while on duty.
   In handing Craid Peyer, 38, the maximum sentence Wednesday,
Superior Court Judge Richard Huffman said the former patrolman
violated society's trust, but added the California Highway Patrol
``bears some blame for this tragedy.''
   Huffman noted that the agency received a complaint about a month
before the Dec. 27, 1986, death of Cara Knott, 20, that could have
tipped them off to Peyer's habit of pulling young women over at a
dark, isolated Interstate 15 exit ramp.
   ``Whether or not Mr. Peyer would have remained a highway
patrolman after that is another issue. But what is true is that
Cara Knott would be alive and Craig Peyer would not be on his way
to state prison,'' the judge said.
   Peyer's conviction is being appealed, defense attorneys said.
The 13-year patrol member was the second officer in the agency's
58-year history to be convicted in the on-duty slaying of a
motorist.
   Peyer was convicted June 22 of first-degree murder in his second
trial. His first trial ended in February when the jury deadlocked
7-5 in favor of conviction.
   Huffman issued the sentence, which included a $1,000 fine, after
hearing impassioned pleas from the families of the victim and the
defendant.
   ``My husband was a friendly, vibrant, well-loved person ... and
in my heart and in my family's heart we all know that you have the
wrong man,'' Peyer's wife, Karen, told the court as her husband
sobbed.
   Samuel Knott, the victim's father, was unmoved.
   ``It is our fervent hope that this predator will never walk the
streets again ... the punishment must be the maximum the law will
allow,'' he said.
   Huffman denied a defense request for bail pending an appeal,
saying he was a threat to the community. Peyer was remanded to the
custody of sheriff's deputies for eventual transfer to state prison.
   He could be eligible for parole in 17 years, 8 months, Deputy
District Attorney Paul Pfingst said.

   A computer system had taken control of the countdown 31 seconds
before the planned ignition. When it detected the problem, it
automatically sent a signal to stop the firing sequence.
   The shutdown signal came ``just after the go for main engine
start was issued,'' Harris said.
   It was another major disappointment for shuttle program managers
who have been grooming Discovery for the first shuttle flight since
the loss of Challenger and its crew of seven in an explosion 73
seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Harris said that immediately after the shutdown of the system,
the launch team remotely began to make the vehicle safe as it sat
on the pad, its tank loaded with 385,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen
and 143,000 gallons of liquid oxygen.
   He said preparations were being made to drain the propellants
from the fuel tank.

   Michael Dukakis' longtime physician today said
rumors that the Democratic presidential nominee had received
psychiatric counseling ``have no basis in fact'' and were
politically motivated.
   Dr. Gerald R. Plotkin was marched out late Wednesday and
appeared on two television networks this morning to discount rumors
about Dukakis' medical past that were brought into full focus with
a gaffe by President Reagan earlier Wednesday.
   ``He has never had any psychological symptoms or problems and he
has never had any treatment for such,'' Plotkin said on CBS-TV's
``This Morning.''
   Plotkin said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show that Dukakis ``is
usually feeling well, upbeat and very vigorous.''
   ``I would have to assume that the rumors are political,'' he
said. ``I don't know whether the term is dirty tricks, but I think
certainly the allegations ... have no basis in fact.''
   On Wednesday, Plotkin said Dukakis showed no signs of clinical
depression after two incidents that supposedly caused him to
stumble psychologically: his loss in the 1978 gubernatorial
primary, and the 1973 death of his brother Stelian in a hit-and-run
accident. Stelian had undergone psychiatric treatment for years
after a suicide attempt.
   ``There is a normal grieving after any loss, from minor to
major, and the response usually is in relation to the gravity of
the loss,'' Plotkin said. ``I was struck at the time of both losses
at his strength rather then his depression.''
   ``I'm a very healthy guy,'' Dukakis told reporters earlier. ``I
think it was the Greeks who said a sound body and a sound mind is
what one needs, especially if one is running for president.''
   Dukakis was heading to Mississippi today to begin a campaign
trip that also included stops in California, Washington and
Colorado.
   Dukakis and Plotkin were responding to rumors that had been
spread during the Democratic National Convention by supporters of
political extremist Lyndon LaRouche and reported in a few
newspapers in recent days.
   The questions intensified after Reagan referred to Dukakis as an
``invalid'' when asked Wednesday morning whether he thought Dukakis
should release his medical records. The question was posed by a
reporter for the Executive Intelligence Review, a LaRouche
publication.
   The president apologized a few minutes later and said he was
attempting a joke.
   Dukakis was graceful when asked about Reagan's remarks.
   ``No apology was really needed,'' Dukakis said. ``We all
occasionally misspeak and I don't think the president needed to
apologize.''
   His wife, Kitty, was less kind.
   Mrs. Dukakis, campaigning in New Jersey, said such remarks come
when ``people are desperate and afraid of dealing with the real
issues.''
   Plotkin released a three-page statement he said summarized all
treatment he has given Dukakis over the past 17 years at the
Harvard Community Health Plan, a health maintenance organization
whose services are available through the state employees benefits
program. Prior to that, Dukakis was treated by his father, a family
doctor.
   Plotkin said he has treated Dukakis for:
   _Plantar fascitis, a form of minor foot discomfort associated
with jogging, in 1983. He since has given up jogging but keeps an
almost daily regimen of speed walking.
   _A pinched nerve in his neck, in 1979.
   _A pulled achilles tendon, in 1976.
   The prescribed treatment for those conditions was rest, heat and
naproxen, an anti-inflammatory medicine slightly more powerful than
aspirin, Plotkin said.
   The doctor said Dukakis also was treated for:
   _A minor fracture of his collarbone, suffered in a foot race in
Ireland in 1976. Dukakis was treated in Ireland and saw Plotkin for
a follow-up X-ray.
   _A splinter under the nail of his left index finger, in 1979.
   _Hoarseness, in 1981, which was attributed to his teaching at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   _A cyst on his back, in 1986, which was drained.
   Plotkin said the material he had released was essentially that
contained in his file on Dukakis with the exception of personal
notes. Those notes contain no reference to any possible
psychological ailment, he said, adding that he has never expressed
any concern about Dukakis' health to another doctor.
   Plotkin said Dukakis could have been treated by another doctor
but that he considered the prospect highly unlikely.
   Vice President George Bush also has released details on his
medical background but no actual medical records. The certain
Republican nominee disclosed, ``I have mild arthritis in the hips,
which is non-limiting,'' and an allergy to bee stings for which he
receives shots.
   Some of the talk and actions Wednesday recalled the 1972
presidential race, when Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri was forced
off the Democratic ticket following disclosure that the vice
presidential nominee had undergone shock therapy for mental
depression.

<HEAD>Panel Calls for Improved Health Care for Pregnant Women, Newborns</HEAD>

   The nation would save money at the same time
it saves its children by redirecting resources to health care for
pregnant women and their newborn infants, a federal commission said
today.
   ``We spend vast amounts on a compassionate effort to save sick
children when we could spend far less to assure they are born
healthy,'' said a report of the National Commission to Prevent
Infant Mortality.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the panel which was
created by Congress in July 1987, was presenting the final report
today during an appearance at the National Press Club.
   ``No nation can long call itself great that does not put its
children first,'' Chiles said in a letter accompanying the report.
``To that end, our commission report is a hammer on the anvil of
public commitment. And we want the echoes to spread throughout the
country.''
   The report says 40,000 infants die each year in the United
States before they reach their first birthday and that, without
changes, ``in the next 13 years we will lose more American infants
than we have lost soldiers in all the wars fought by the nation in
this century.''
   ``These facts would be sad enough were it not for the additional
fact that at least half of the deaths are preventable,'' it said.
   Chiles, discussing the report on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America'' before its formal release, said that those who ``suffer
the most are the poor _ and that's true whether they're white poor
in Appalachia or they're black poor.''
   A child born in the United States has a poorer chance of
surviving his or her first year than one born in 19 other
industrialized nations, the report said.
   Chiles said in the interview that a child born in Hong Kong or
Singapore ``would have a better chance of reaching its first
birthday than (one born) in the United States.''
   The report did not cite any source for this information, and
various groups that compile such figures have differed in where the
United States ranks. The Children's Defense Fund, a children's
advocacy agency, reported in 1987 that the United States had
slipped to last place among 20 industrialized nations, with 11 out
of every 1,000 children born dying before they reach their first
birthday.
   However, UNICEF reported earlier this year that the U.S. rate of
10.6 per 1,000 live births put the United States in the 18th rank
out of 36 industrialized nations.
   The commission recommends a national campaign to emphasize
infant mortality and says a permanent national council on
children's health should be established.
   ``It is time we made a visible, tangible commitment to our
children's health, to their quality of life and to our nation's
future _ because it is cost effective and, more importantly,
because it is right,'' the report said.
   While not losing site of the moral commitment a society owes its
young, the report emphasizes in several places the sheer financial
prudence of spending on prenatal care.
   ``Every low birthweight birth that could be averted would save
the U.S. health care system between $14,000 and $30,000,'' it said.
   ``The lifetime custodial costs for a low birthweight infant can
reach $400,000,'' it continued. ``The cost of prenatal care _ care
that might prevent low birthweight condition in the first place _
can be as little as $400.''
   The report makes two fundamental recommendations:
   _``We must provide universal access to early maternity and
pediatric care for all mothers and infants. ... Employers must make
available health insurance coverage that includes maternity and
well-baby care. Government must assume responsibility for those who
lack private insurance or are unable to pay.
   Chiles, in the television interview, commented that ``all
elderly people in this country, regardless of their status, ...
have medical care. We have not said that about pregnant women; we
have not said that about our children.''
   _``We must initiate immediately a sustained, broad-based effort
to make the health and well-being of mothers and infants a national
priority and give them public attention and resources they
deserve.''
   The panel recommended that Congress raise appropriations for six
separate programs that would benefit pregnant women and their
newborn children _ such as the supplemental food program for women,
infants and children and the child immunization program _ but it
gave no figures.

<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES thruout with Murphy meeting with Husseini, quotes. No

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Murphy today held talks with government leaders on arranging the
smooth election of a new president of the war-torn country.
   Accompanied by U.S. Ambassador John Kelly, Murphy met for an
hour with acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss in Hoss' heavily
fortified house in Moslem west Beirut. He then met with Parliament
Speaker Hussein Husseini.
   It was not known whether the officials discussed the 18 Western
hostages held in Lebanon. The Lebanese government has not been able
to do anything about the hostages because civil war has eroded its
power.
   Murphy refused to speak to reporters after the Hoss meeting.
Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, also refused comment.
   After his two-hour meeting with Husseini, a Shiite Moslem,
Murphy told reporters: ``My visit is not to demonstrate that we are
the major force in the elections. It is to underline our interest
that the elections take place for the new president of Lebanon.''
   Murphy, in charge of Middle East affairs at the State
Department, added, ``We hope that those elections will take place
in the very near future, that they will take place in a peaceful
atmosphere, in an orderly atmosphere so that the candidate would be
a legitimate transition from one hand to another.''
   Murphy also planned talks with Christian President Amin Gemayel
at his palace in suburban Baabda.
   The United States and Syria, Lebanon's main power broker, have
been trying to get Lebanon's warring Moslems and Christians to
negotiate political reforms that could end 13 years of civil strife.
   Gemayel's six-year-term expires Sept. 23. Parliament must elect
a successor at least one week before Gemayel bows out.
   Nine Americans are among the hostages believed held by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists. The longest held of the 18 is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Soviet Negotiator Reports Some Progress At START Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top Soviet arms control negotiator today said
his nation and the United States have made modest progress toward
an agreement on reducing long-range nuclear weapons since the
Moscow summit in June.
   But the negotiator, Alexei Obukhov, also told the 40-nation
Geneva Conference on Disarmament that ``there is a great amount of
work that yet has to be done to resolve outstanding issues.''
   The arms control negotiators returned to Geneva on July 12 to
resume talks on a treaty to reduce long-range, or strategic,
nuclear forces by 50 percent. They are also working on a document
governing defense and space issues.
   Obukhov said ``the very first weeks of the current negotiating
round have already seen certain progress. One has to be
self-critical however _ the progress achieved is very modest.''
   He said the Soviet side has introduced ``a whole range of
proposals'' at the talks during the past three weeks and is waiting
for a U.S. response.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
U.S. side also has been offering proposals during the talks. ``What
both delegations are engaged in is seeing how progress at the
Moscow summit can be reflected here in specific treaty language,''
he told The Associated Press.
   Obukhov said one main issue at the arms talks is compliance with
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, and he indicated that the
U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative program, or SDI, remains an
obstacle.
   Obukhov reaffirmed the Soviet position that a strategic arms
treaty, or START, should be linked to an agreement assuring that
development and deployment of strategic defenses, such as SDI, does
not violate the ABM treaty.
   He reiterated the Soviet position that a broad interpretation of
the ABM treaty, which the Reagan administration says would permit
SDI development, was not feasible.
   Another outstanding issue, Obukhov said, is limitations on
submarine-launched cruise missiles, which the Soviets want included
in the treaty. The U.S. opposes including such weapons in the
treaty because it says it would be too difficult to prevent
cheating.
   Obukhov said the two sides are working on four joint draft texts
at the START talks: the treaty, a memorandum of understanding, a
protocol on inspection, and a protocol on conversion and
elimination of systems.
   In December, President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a
treaty eliminating all intermediate-range nuclear weapons. The pact
was ratified by both countries before the two leaders held the
Moscow summit in June.

   Sikh terrorists burst into a hospital
room in a northern Indian town today and killed a Hindu leader who
was recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident, a police
official said.
   The official, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said two Sikhs entered the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital at
Ludhiana town and gunned down Tej Pal Sathi, the president of the
Shiv Sena, a fundamentalist Hindu party.
   Two of Sathi's police bodyguards were also shot and killed, the
official said. A news agency report said the militants fired at
least 30 rounds from automatic rifles during the attack.
   Sathi was involved in the car accident Monday while returning
from the funeral of another Hindu leader shot to death by Sikh
militants.
   Ludhiana, in Punjab state, is 55 miles west of Chandigarh, the
state capital.
   Also today, the United News of India news agency said three
Sikhs were shot and killed by militant Sikhs in Punjab's Ferozepur
district on Wednesday night.
   Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for an independent
homeland in Punjab state. At least 1,638 people have been killed in
Sikh violence in Punjab this year. Most of their victims are Hindus
or moderate Sikhs.
   Sikhs are a minority in India and claim they are discriminated
against by the majority Hindus. Sikhs are the majority in Punjab.

   Iran said today that 1,700 people were
injured in an Iraqi chemical bomb attack on a northern town, and
Iran's foreign minister formally protested to the U.N. Security
Council.
   Iran also said Iraqi military aircraft bombed two industrial
targets in western Lorestan province and injured a number of
workers. It did not give details.
   In the Persian Gulf today, Iranian gunboats fired at a Norwegian
tanker after it refused to stop for an inspection, gulf-based
shipping executives said. The captain said a few bullets pierced
the ship but caused no injuries.
   Earlier reports from Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency said 1,031 civilians were injured in an Iraqi chemical bomb
attack Tuesday in the town of Oshnaviyeh in the northern province
of West Azerbaijan.
   Today, IRNA raised the injury toll to 1,700.
   ``Over 100 of the victims, mainly women and children, have
reportedly been seriously affected and are being treated in various
hospitals in the province,'' IRNA said.
   Iraq denied it dropped chemical bombs on the area, according to
the official Iraqi News Agency.
   On Wednesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati lodged
a formal protest with the Security Council over the alleged
chemical attack, and said it should impose sanctions on Iraq.
   A report released Monday by a U.N. team concluded that Iraq has
made repeated and extensive use of chemical warfare in the war,
violating international law. Iraq claims Iran used chemical weapons
first.
   It also found that nine Iraqi soldiers were poisoned recently by
chemical weapons, but left open the question of whether Iran was to
blame.
   Velayati was in New York to represent Iran at U.N.-sponsored
talks aimed at ending the 8-year-old war. Iran said July 18 it
would accept a year-old Security Council cease-fire resolution.
   Iraq, which said it would accept the resolution soon after it
passed, insists on direct talks with Iran before a cease-fire. Iran
wants a cease-fire before direct talks.
   Lt. Gen. Martin Vadset of Norway, head of a U.N. cease-fire
team, was expected to arrive today in New York from Amman, Jordan,
to deliver a report to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   Vadset spent about 10 days in Tehran and Baghdad.
   Shipping executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Iranian gunboats fired at the 284,502-ton Berge Lord tanker today
about 25 miles off the southern gulf port of Dubai.
   ``Apart from some bullet holes near the bridge, we've got no
damage at all,'' the captain, Leif Klausen, told the Norwegian NTB
news agency.
   ``Six fast gunboats approached us and asked us to stop for
inspection. When I refused because the boats had no markings, one
boat opened machine-gun fire,'' he was quoted as saying in a
telephone interview.
   The tanker was headed to Rotterdam from Saudi Arabia with a load
of crude.
   The Berge Lord, attacked previously this year, did not stop and
proceeded with its voyage southward, the sources said.
   U.S. Navy sources said the missile cruiser USS Halsey responded
to the tanker's distress calls, but when it checked if assistance
was required, the captain of the Berge Lord declined and kept
sailing.
   It was the first hostile incident involving a neutral ship in
the gulf since Iran announced it would accept a cease-fire. Iranian
gunboats last attacked a tanker on July 15.
   Sources said Iran was exercising the right, under international
maritime law, for nations at war to stop and inspect ships anywhere
at sea to check for cargo bound for their enemy.
   Iran says it has stopped thousands of ships for inspections, and
shipping executives say the Iranians occasionally fire warning
shots.

   A couple who were arrested and falsely accused by a
department store of shoplifting a $200 computer printer they were
trying to exchange has been awarded $2.25 million by a jury.
   ``I hope this will teach them a lesson and it won't happen
again,'' said Kenneth Geringer, 32. ``It could happen to anybody.
One minute you're walking through a store, and the next minute they
call you a criminal.''
   The verdict Tuesday went against Zayre Corp. and two security
employees even though the couple testified they bought the
defective printer from a rival store then attempted to exchange it
at the Zayre store in Hallandale in 1985.
   After two hours of deliberations, the state jury found that
Zayre and the employees caused the couple ``emotional distress''
and ``maliciously and without probable cause'' brought grand theft
charges against them.
   The charges, which carry up to five years in prison, were
dropped several months after the arrest.
   The jury awarded $700,000 in actual damages and $1 million in
punitive damages to Allisa Geringer, 31, and $50,000 in actual
damages and $500,000 in punitive damages to her husband.
   Charles Sinclair, an attorney for the Massachusetts-based Zayre
Corp., said he wil ask the court to reduce the award.

<HEAD>590 Refused to Bear Arms since 1977, At Least 40 Jailed a Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A senior Communist Party official said
590 conscientious objectors have refused to do compulsory 18-month
military service in Hungary since 1977, a newspaper said today.
   It was believed to be the first such public admission regarding
conscientious objectors by a Hungarian official.
   Ferenc Szombathelyi, deputy head of department in the party's
Central Committee, told the party daily Nepszabadsag that 40 to 45
young people were jailed annually.
   ``This practice must be changed now,'' he said.
   He said that ``compulsory work in health and social
institutions, communal establishments and major investment
projects'' might be suitable alternatives to military service.
   The issue of conscientious objectors has been under debate in
Hungary, with church officials and dissidents demanding that
authorities change draft provisions.
   In June, at least 700 people signed a petition for introduction
of an alternative to military service that was presented to
Parliament.
   People who refuse to do mandatory military service in Hungary
for reasons of conscience or religion can be imprisoned for up to
five years.
   However, Jehova's Witnesses, members of the Church of the
Nazarene and Seventh-Day Adventists are exempted from military
service.
   ``A conscript serves 18 months in the armed forces (and) it is
conceivable that those doing civilian work instead would serve a
longer term,'' Szombathelyi said.
   ``The cases would be examined individually and meticulously
...(and) on no account should exemption be granted to `clever guys'
or irresponsible persons,'' the official said, without elaboration.
   In June, Poland became the first East bloc country to establish
an alternative civilian service.

<HEAD>Body Of Aged Nursing Home Patient Found In National Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 87-year-old man found dead in a park
may have tried to re-live his escape from a World War II prison
camp by fleeing a nursing home during a fire drill, his doctor says.
   Josef Fruewirth was found Wednesday a half-mile from Hot Springs
Nursing Home, which he left on June 30, said his physician, William
R. Mashburn, who is also the Garland County coroner.
   During World War II, Fruewirth tunneled out of a Soviet prison
camp and walked 625 miles to his native Austria, where he was
reunited with his family, Mashburn said.
   Fruewirth died of exposure complicated by lack of medication for
heart disease and probably did not survive 24 hours after leaving
the home, Mashburn said. The three-pack-per-day smoker also had
emphysema and signs of early Alzheimer's disease, the coroner said.
   ``The bell ringing and confusion may have caused a flashback to
a time in his life when he was a prisoner. He was very unhappy in
the nursing home. He felt, to a degree, incarcerated,'' Mashburn
said. ``This drill was evidently what he had been waiting for. I
truly believe the clanging and people being pushed out _ well, he
escaped once, and I think he tried to do so again.''
   ``He had amazing stamina,'' said Becky Ponder, a registered
nurse at the home. ``Anyone who would walk over 600 miles to get
back to his family is capable of anything.''
   His body was found in the rugged, mountainous terrain of Hot
Springs National Park, which begins near the nursing home.
   ``We found him within a few feet of a beautiful little spring.
You wouldn't find a more peaceful place to go to God,'' Mashburn
said.

<HEAD>Hooks Calls for Dropping of Charges against Rowan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the NAACP is calling on District
of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry to overrule the city's legal counsel
and drop weapons charges against newspaper columnist Carl Rowan.
   But a spokesman for the mayor says Barry doesn't have the
authority or the inclination to ask that the charges be dropped.
   ``Carl Rowan is not, and never has been, a lawbreaker,''
Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the civil rights group, said
in a statement Wednesday. ``To the contrary, he has spent 40 years
as a distinguished journalist, trying to force presidents,
governors, Congress and others to obey the Constitution, to enforce
decent laws, so that black people might be free.''
   Last week the city's corporation counsel, Frederick Cooke, filed
charges of possession of an unregistered weapon and ammunition
against Rowan in connection with the shooting of a teen-ager in the
columnist's back yard.
   John White, a spokesman for Barry, said the mayor had not yet
seen the letter but didn't plan to ask Cooke to drop the charges.
   ``The mayor does not have the authority,'' said White. ``It is
the feeling of this office that perhaps Mr. Hooks has not read the
D.C. law. Under the city charter, the corporation counsel is the
chief legal officer of the city.''
   Hooks told The Washington Post that every executive must
occasionally correct staff members' mistakes.
   ``People in my office quite often do things that I overrule
because it's not in the best interest of my organization in the
long run to do that,'' he said. ``And that's what I'm asking Marion
Barry: to overrule a mistake made by his corporation counsel.''
   But White said, ``It's the mayor's policy not to interfere with
the corporation counsel's decisions. He feels that, where would it
stop if he started telling the corporation counsel when or when not
to press charges.''
   Benjamin Smith, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., had scaled Rowan's
eight-foot fence with at least one friend on June 14 to take a
late-night dip in the columnist's pool. Rowan told police he shot
the youth in the hand with a .22-caliber revolver because he
thought the teen was lunging toward him.
   Investigators discovered that the gun, which had been given to
Rowan by his son, a former FBI agent, was not properly registered
with the city.

   For at least the next year, the Dallas Ballet will
be a road show only, having failed to raise the $1.3 million needed
to begin its home season in October.
   ``We didn't have enough funds pledged to start paying the
dancers and launch the season,'' said executive director Jack Page.
``And rather than start out and run out of gas before we got to the
end of the line, we elected not even to start.''
   However, the company has arranged a Sept. 2-12 tour of Denmark,
Page said Wednesday. Negotiations with Spain also are under way for
a tour there.
   The 28-dancer company was scheduled to begin a three-month
season Oct. 13 with a production of ``Swan Lake.''
   The cancellation came despite an offer by dancers to accept only
half the back pay owed them and to reduce the number of contract
weeks for the season.
   The company has been plagued by money problems since early 1987,
when dancers with tin cans stood on street corners, trying to raise
money.

<HEAD>Residents Find Ways to Stay Cool Despite Air Conditioner Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenants of an apartment complex that bans air
conditioners are among the city's most creative when it comes to
finding ways to beat this summer's record heat.
   The Stuyvesant Town apartment complex in Manhattan is home to
18,000 middle-income tenants, many of whom could pay the price for
cooling units.
   But air conditioning is not allowed and hasn't been since the
complex was built 40 years ago for returning World War II
servicemen.
   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., which owns the complex, says
the aging wiring couldn't safely support thousands of air
conditioners.
   Rewiring the apartments would cost at least $50 million, said
Fred Wortman, a Metropolitan Life vice president. Officials hope to
have a plan ready by year's end, he said, but rewiring would take
years to complete.
   Meanwhile, tenants do what they can. Some don't cook. Some spend
as much time as they can at friends' air-conditioned apartments or
in grocery stores.
   Others have four or eight fans going at the same time _ setting
them up at strategic angles to get the best breeze possible.
   ``There is an art to this,'' said Ed Petty, a four-fan resident.
   Some tenants have broken the rules and shelled out $850 for the
Delonghi Pinguino, an Italian-made, windowless free-standing air
conditioner.
   After this record-breaking summer, others have a more permanent
solution on their minds _ moving.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan today said it was dismissing within
two weeks all 21,200 Palestinian civil servants working at
Jordanian institutions in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   In Israel, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
the move will only hurt Palestinians living in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   The decision, announced by state-run Radio Jordan, followed King
Hussein's announcement Sunday that he was severing administrative
ties with the West Bank to give more responsibility to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The announcement was carried by the radio following a Cabinet
meeting headed by Prime Minister Zaid Rifai.
   ``The decision is in accordance with the kingdom's decision to
cut legal and administrative links with Palestinians in the
occupied lands,'' the radio said.
   ``All Jordanian citizens working for official and government
agencies will be retired as of Aug. 16,'' the radio said.
   The radio said civil servants who have worked less than 15 years
will be dismissed with a month's salary for every year of service.
A Jordanian official said 16,000 of the civil servants fall into
this category.
   The official said responsibility for those 16,000 will lie with
the PLO.
   Those who have worked more than 15 years also will be dismissed,
but they will continue to receive their monthly salaries from
Jordan until they retire on a pension after 20 years have elapsed
since they began working, the report said. The official said 5,200
civil servants fall into this category.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt during the 1967 Middle East War. Since December,
Palestinians in the occupied lands have been waging an uprising
against Israeli occupation in which more than 235 Palestinians and
four Israelis have been killed. The uprising has been directed by
underground leaders linked to the PLO, which also provides funding.
   Even after Jordan lost control of the West Bank, it continued to
pay its employees there and run the schools as well as other
administrative offices. About 850,000 Palestinians live in the West
Bank.
   One Palestinian affected by the decision, 55-year-old Jamila
Azmi of Bethlehem, who has worked 30 years as a school principal,
said:
   ``I don't think it is fair. Who is going to take care of the
fired employees? The only alternative is to work in Israel. I wish
they had thought before they made the decision.''
   In Israel, a spokesman quoted Shamir as saying that Jordan's
dismissal of the Palestinian employees will only hurt Palestinians
in the occupied lands because they ``will have to live with less
money.''
   The decision also terminates the services of an unspecified
number of workers at private institutions and companies linked to
the government, who will receive severance pay according to their
employers' rules, the radio said.
   Those working for courts and the authority that controls mosques
and other religious institution are exempt from the measures, the
announcement said.
   On Saturday, the king dissolved the lower house of the Jordanian
Parliament, where 30 of the 60 members came from the West Bank.
   Late last month, he also canceled a $1.3 billion development
program for education and economic projects in the West Bank.
   About 110,000 Palestinians are employed in Israel but about
one-quarter of them have frequently missed work during the uprising.

   An entertainment lawyer whose clients include
writers and producers was credited with a key role in reaching a
settlement in the strike that crippled Hollywood for 22 weeks.
   Kenneth Ziffren, 48, was hailed as ``the Philip Habib of
Hollywood'' by one writer-producer after negotiators announced a
settlement in the strike Wednesday. He served as a non-official
go-between during the talks.
   ``He could communicate through this haze of anger, vitriolic
hatred and distrust,'' said Gary David Goldberg, who compared
Ziffren to the U.S. diplomat Habib.
   Ziffren, described as an intensely private man, did not return
phone calls seeking comment on his role in helping reach a
compromise.
   Colleagues and clients said Ziffren was effective because of his
diplomatic style and rapport with writers and producers as well as
his ability to get to the heart of the strike's issues.
   ``His mind is so precise,'' said Norman Steinberg, a
screenwriter and Ziffren client. ``He just clicks onto the salient
facts and all the crap is swept away.''
   Colleagues also said Ziffren has a remarkable ability with
numbers, something that would help him in calculating complex
residual formulas, which determines payments from reruns and
syndication.
   ``He carries all the numbers in his head,'' Goldberg said.
   Ziffren's firm, Ziffren, Brittenham & Branca, represents a
variety of Hollywood talent, including TV writers and
writer-producers like Goldberg (``Family Ties''), Stephen Cannell
(``Hunter,'' ``Wiseguy'') and Glen Larson (``Quincy,'' ``Magnum
P.I.).
   The firm also represents financiers like oilman Marvin Davis and
broadcaster Ted Turner, and studio executives such as ABC's Brandon
Stoddard and Harris Katleman, president of 20th Century Fox
Television Productions.
   His actor clients include Harrison Ford, Tom Selleck, Richard
Pryor and John Ritter.
   Ziffren, described by friends as a workaholic, didn't let his
work keep him from attending to at least some details of his
personal life. He was married during the strike.

   American Samoa's non-voting delegate to
Congress, in an effort to ``avoid further shame,'' pleaded guilty
to a charge he participated in a $130,920 payroll padding scheme,
his lawyer says.
   Defense lawyer Earl Silbert told U.S. District Judge Stanley
Harris on Wednesday that Del. Fofo I.F. Sunia stood ``a reasonable
chance of acquittal'' if the case went to trial.
   But Silbert said that Sunia, a Democrat who has represented
Samoa since 1981, was pleading guilty to a single charge of
conspiracy to defraud the government ``to avoid further shame to
himself and his people.''
   Sunia insists that he did not participate in the conspiracy from
its inception in early 1983, but later became aware that his chief
aide, Matthew Iuli, had arranged for paychecks to be issued to
people who were not working for the congressman, Silbert said.
   Iuli also pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge as well as a
second count of filing a false payroll document.
   Silbert told Harris that Sunia will resign from the House, where
he can vote only in committees, before his Oct. 4 sentencing.
   The lawmaker declined to comment on his guilty plea or say when
he would resign. Sunia, 51, could receive a five-year sentence and
a $250,000 fine.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Andary revealed in court that
Iuli began cooperating with federal investigators 18 months ago,
even though he remains on Sunia's payroll to this day.
   Sunia was aware of Iuli's cooperation with the Secret Service
agents who were investigating the case, according to sources
familiar with the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   By way of some explanation, Silbert said the cultural background
of Sunia and Iuli, plus their ``extraordinarily passive
personalities, combined to make one of the strangest cases I've
ever encountered.''
   The defense lawyer told the judge that Sunia did not profit from
the scheme.
   But Andary disputed that contention, saying the lawmaker used
$39,112 for personal expenses, including payments on a house and a
car.
   Silbert said the money was used mostly to pay the hotel bills
and restaurant tabs of visiting constituents _ Samoan hospitality
that was expected from Sunia.
   Investigators were tipped to the scheme in late 1985 when a
former member of Sunia's staff, Roger Hazell, complained that his
W-2 tax form showed he had earned an extra $1,995.
   Secret Service agents determined the paycheck had been deposited
in a joint checking account held by Sunia and Iuli.
   A large number of payroll checks ended up in the account or
another for the Committee to Re-Elect Fofo, Andary said.
   None of the Samoans named as payees worked for Sunia and told
investigators they were unaware their names were on the
congressman's payroll, Andary said.
   The prosecutor said Iuli conceived the scheme in early 1983
after the congressman's staff was doubled from nine to 18 members.
Iuli determined that there was not enough work for 18 people but
the office would lose any money he didn't spend to hire extra
people, Andary said.
   So he placed phony names on the payroll to get the money to
defray some of the costs of running the office, Andary said.
   Iuli also used some of the money to reimburse himself for
expenses he had paid out of his own pocket, Andary said.
   Iuli's sentencing was scheduled for Oct. 3. He could receive two
five-year terms but prosecutors agreed not to seek the maximum
sentence against him.
   In return for Sunia's guilty plea, prosecutors agreed not to
prosecute him for forgery and false statements, including false
reports to the Federal Election Commission.
   Both men agreed to make restitution of undisclosed amounts of
money.

<HEAD>State Troopers Not Amused By Teen Clerk's Practical Joke</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16-year-old convenience store clerk has
been charged with putting too much salt on a state trooper's
sandwich.
   The clerk, who was charged with disorderly conduct, punishable
by up to a $300 fine, said that he did nothing wrong and that if
anyone sabotaged the sandwich, it was done when he wasn't looking.
His boss is backing him up.
   Trooper Barry Gaston said Wednesday a fellow officer ordered the
sandwich by telephone from the store in suburban Philadelphia on
July 26. The officer, whom police declined to identify, told the
clerk he was a trooper.
   When another trooper arrived to pick up the sandwich, Gaston
said, ``He noticed people snickering and laughing.''
   Gaston said the officer who ordered the sandwich found it
heavily salted. The officer has high blood pressure, which can be
aggravated by salt.
   ``I'm not sure how practical and how much of a joke it is,'' Lt.
Daniel Worst said. ``It's not amusing. It makes you wonder. If
they're going to do this to the police, what are they going to do
to other people?''
   David Uriarte, who this fall will be a junior in high school,
said that he used the usual amount of salt and pepper and that if
more was on the ham and cheese sandwich either he made an honest
mistake or someone else sabotaged it.
   ``I wrapped it up, and while I was making it I had to leave a
few times to wait on other customers,'' Uriarte said Wednesday. He
said someone could have overheard him refer to the call-in customer
as a state trooper.
   Louis Marks, the store owner, said police came to the store the
day after the incident and urged him to fire Uriarte. ``They're
making a great deal out of this thing. I just can't believe it,''
Marks said.
   Cpl. Joe Fuentes said the charge carries a message. ``Basically,
we don't want the other kids out there to get the idea, `Hey, let's
fool around with the state troopers' food,''' he said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Evokes `American Dream,' Trying to Leave Health Story
Behind</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Cuomo, Babbitt, Plotkin comments in top 12

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis campaigned in the South today, talking of civil
rights, while his doctor and prominent Democrats suggested
political motives for rumors that Dukakis had been treated for
psychological problems. Dukakis and the doctor said the rumors were
false.
   Republican George Bush was headed to Corpus Christi, Texas, to
deliver a speech in which aides said he would highlight his
differences with Dukakis on defense. Bush had no comment on the
Dukakis-health story, saying he wouldn't be dragged into the
``mini-controversy.''
   Gerald R. Plotkin, Dukakis' physician for the past 17 years,
said today, ``I would have to assume that the rumors are political.
I don't know whether the term is dirty tricks, but I think
certainly the allegations ... have no basis in fact.''
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said today, ``I think there's
something significant about what the Republicans have done here,
the fact that they would use Lyndon LaRouche to get this thing
started, the fact that they would get negative, that they would get
to irrelevant so early.''
   The rumors began spreading at the Democratic National Convention
in Atlanta two weeks ago when supporters of LaRouche, a political
extremist and fringe presidential candidate, distributed fliers
suggesting Dukakis was unstable. The issue burst into public view
Wednesday after President Reagan called Dukakis ``an invalid'' in
answer to a question at the White House from a reporter from a
LaRouche-connected publication.
   Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who was defeated by Dukakis
in the Democratic primaries, said today that he'd first noted the
rumors from the fliers in Atlanta.
   Plotkin commented on CBS-TV and NBC-TV, Cuomo and Babbitt on CBS.
   Dukakis, trying to leave the subject behind, flew to
Philadelphia, Miss.
   ``Here in Mississippi, you know the importance of equal rights
and civil rights,'' Dukakis said in remarks prepared for the
Neshoba County Fair, the same rural gathering where Ronald Reagan
kicked off his campaign as the Republican presidential nominee in
1980.
   ``And today, I say to all Americans _ East, West, North and
South _ let us work together, let us work together to bring down
the barriers to opportunity for all our people,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Let us work together to see that every citizen and every child
born in this country is an equal shareholder in the American
dream,'' he said.
   A day earlier, back in Washington, Reagan was asked whether
Dukakis should release his medical records.
   Reagan quipped that he didn't want to ``pick on an invalid'' _ a
reference to Dukakis that he later retracted as a bad joke. Hours
later, Dukakis' personal physician released a summary of their
17-year relationship as patient and doctor.
   ``He has had no significant illnesses during his lifetime and
has been in excellent health,'' Plotkin said at a news conference
called by the Dukakis campaign.
   ``He has had no psychological symptoms, complaints or
treatment,'' Plotkin said.
   The three-page summary listed minor ailments, breaks, bumps and
bruises such as a pinched neck nerve, pulled Achilles' tendon,
hoarseness from lecturing, and a cyst on his back.
   Questions about Dukakis' mental health centered on his loss in
the 1978 gubernatorial primary, and the 1973 death of his brother
Stelian in a hit-and-run accident. Stelian had undergone
psychiatric treatment for years after a suicide attempt.
   ``I was struck at the time of both losses at his strength rather
then his depression,'' Plotkin said, describing Dukakis' reaction.
   Dukakis had a less detailed summary, saying, ``I'm a very
healthy guy.''
   Bush, meanwhile, refused to comment on the Dukakis medical
records question, referring to it as a ``mini-controversy.'' He did
say he would release his own records.
   The certain Republican nominee continued his weeklong effort to
show up Dukakis as weak and inexperienced on defense and foreign
affairs. The speech today before the G.I. Forum was the second
foreign policy address by Bush this week.
   ``There will be more references to the Bush foreign policy as it
compares to the more liberal Democratic approach that comes from
the Dukakis forces,'' said Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller.
   Bush toured a defense plant in Annapolis, Md., on Wednesday, and
took time to stand squarely behind the president on his veto of a
$299.5 billion defense bill.
   Bush said Reagan had made a ``tough call ... the right call'' in
vetoing the defense authorization bill, which would slash funds for
the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Dukakis campaign describes
the administration's proposed space-based defense system as
``fantasy.''
   Bush was less firmly behind his boss on the recommendations of
the presidential commission on AIDS. Bush said he essentially
agreed with the recommendations, including a call for legislation
banning discrimination against victims of the deadly disease.
   Earlier this week, Reagan voiced opposition to most of the
panel's central recommendations.
   ``People are scared,'' Bush said. ``If there is a risk of
discrimination, people who have AIDS aren't going to come forward
to be tested and have their disease evaluated.''
   Bush later also called upon the Food and Drug Administration to
do what it could to speed decisions that could make drugs for AIDS
more quickly available.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan's Glib Tongue Gets Him in Trouble Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There you go again, Mr. President.
   Ronald Reagan, the great communicator, the man who is seldom at
a loss for words, has gotten himself into trouble once more with
his glib tongue.
   Once, he spoke into a live microphone and jested about bombing
the Soviet Union.
   Another time, he joked that he sometimes withheld information
from Congress.
   Now he's called Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
an invalid, and then said he was only kidding and shouldn't have
said it.
   Dukakis said no apology was needed. His running mate, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas, called the president's remark ``outrageous and
laughable.'' Vice President George Bush declined to comment.
   Reagan is no stranger to this kind of problem.
   The most recent time he said something that he immediately had
to regret was on March 16 when he was meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir in the Oval Office.
   A reporter asked him to comment on his former national security
adviser, Robert McFarlane, pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges
of withholding information from Congress.
   ``He just pleaded guilty to not telling Congress everything it
wanted to know,'' said Reagan. ``I've done that myself.''
   As reporters left the room, he told Shamir, ``Oh, boy, just for
that careless remark they'll go wild about `Reagan wants to lie to
Congress' or something.''
   Then there was the time, on Aug. 11, 1984, that the president
was doing a voice test for his weekly radio broadcast. Although his
words weren't going out onto the air, they were fed into the White
House press room where reporters were preparing to cover his
remarks.
   ``All right, my fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you today
that I have signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We
begin bombing in five minutes.''
   The president hasn't heard the last of that one yet.
   It wasn't the only time he used his sound tests for some humor
that didn't get on the air, but did get reported.
   Once, he opened up with ``Welcome to Death Valley Days'' _ the
television program he used to host.
   On another occasion, while warming up by reading his prepared
text for a speech about the economy, he added, ``And I am prepared
to tell you, it's a hell of a mess.''
   Another time, he cracked, ``Call the city desk. I've got a story
that will crack this city wide open.''
   Still another time, in a prebroadcast warmup at his California
ranch in 1982, he referred to the leaders of Poland as ``a bunch of
no-good, lousy bums.''
   Wednesday's fracas arose when a reporter asked the president, as
he prepared to leave the White House briefing room after a
question-and-answer session, whether he didn't think Dukakis should
release his medical records.
   Grinning, the president replied, ``I'm not going to pick on an
invalid.''
   A few minutes later, meeting with news executives for a briefing
on Central America, he opened his remarks by saying, ``A short time
ago, I was down in the press room and I attempted a joke in
response to a question, and I think _ I was kidding, but I don't
think I should have said what I said.''
   As Dukakis said, ``We all occasionally misspeak.''
   Some of us just do so more often than others.

   National Guardsmen have moved to the front
line in the war on illegal drugs at the southern frontier as part
of an experiment using soldiers in an intensified search for drug
smugglers.
   The soldiers, who began searching cargo trucks from Mexico on
Wednesday, are among more than 100 National Guard personnel working
with U.S. Customs at border points in Texas, Arizona and Florida,
Customs Service officials said.
   ``I was told it was to test the effectiveness of the National
Guard in working with Customs,'' said Billy McFarland, chief
Customs inspector at Hidalgo on the Mexican border in the lower Rio
Grande Valley.
   The guardsmen underwent training on Monday and Tuesday, said
Charles Conroy, a Customs spokesman in Houston. The experiment ends
Aug. 20.
   ``Today, for all practical purposes, was the first day on the
job,'' Conroy said Wednesday.
   The National Guard last week announced a similar operation
concentrated in southeastern Florida. Authorities estimate up to 70
percent of the drugs entering the United States come through
Florida's 1,350 miles of coastline.
   Gilbert Medina, Customs supervisor of cargo enforcement at
Hidalgo, said the presence of the guardsmen means more trucks
coming from Mexico will be searched.
   ``They're looking for narcotics,'' he said. ``We're
intensifying, more vehicles, more trailers, just intensifying the
examinations.''
   Nearby, an unarmed National Guardsman dressed in camouflage gear
and army boots looked through an 18-wheeler loaded with jalapeno
peppers, while trucks loaded with television sets and mangos
awaited inspection.
   Guardsmen on duty declined to discuss their mission.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir believes Jordan's
move to dismiss 21,200 Palestinia employees in the occupied
territories will hurt Palestinians and not Israel, a spokesman said
today.
   Jordan said today the civil servants will be dismissed by Aug.
16.
   The move came four days after Jordan said it was abandoning
legal and administrative links with Palestinians in the occupied
lands and handing over responsibility to the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The decision dismissing the employees was criticized today by
one West Bank worker who will lost his job. But it drew praise from
a pro-PLO newspaper editor who said the PLO will fill ``the
political vacuum left by Jordan.''
   Jordan's decision ``will certainly increase the pressure on
Arabs in Judea and Samaria,'' Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir,
said, using biblical names for the West Bank. ``They will have to
live with less money.''
   Ahimeir said it was difficult to predict how the dismissals
would affect the 8-month-old uprising in which Palestinians have
been protesting Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. More than 235 Palestinians and four Israelis have been
killed since the uprising began Dec. 8.
   One Palestinian worker who will be dismissed, 55-year-old Jamila
Azmi of Bethlehem, said: ``I don't think it is fair. Who is going
to take care of the fired employees? The only alternative is to
work in Israel.''
   Azmi, who has worked as a school principal for 30 years, added:
``I wish they (Jordanian officials) had thought before they made
the decision.''
   Before Jordan's announcement today, underground leaders of the
Palestinian uprising praised the kingdom for severing ties with the
West Bank and called the move a major achievement of the revolt
against Israeli occupation.
   The statement, in leaflets distributed in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, was the first reaction by the pro-PLO leadership to Sunday's
announcement by King Hussein that he was cutting ties with the West
Bank.
   In Jerusalem, meanwhile, U.S. diplomats said on Wednesday they
were investigating the death of Ribhi Barakat Kayed, 67, a
Palestinian-American who relatives said died after Israeli soldiers
prevented him from getting medication for a heart condition. The
army denied the allegations.
   Violent clashes erupted in two Gaza Strip refugee camps
Wednesday night, and dozens of Arabs were injured by troops,
including a 15-year-old struck in the eye by a rubber bullet.
   In a leaflet distributed in the occupied lands, the PLO-backed
United National Leadership of the Uprising praised Hussein's
decisions.
   Leaflets are the main means of communications between leaders of
the uprising and Arab protesters in the occupied lands.
   The announcement ``enforced the status of the PLO as the sole
representative of the Palestinian people,'' the leaflet said. The
underground leaders took credit for the monarch's move, calling it
``one of the most important achievements of the uprising.''

<HEAD>Witness Says Hamadi Wanted To Exchange Freedom for Hostages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A witness in the trial of
Mohammed Ali Hamadi, charged in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA
jetliner, said today that Hamadi sought to trade freedom from
prison for two West German hostages in Lebanon.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with air piracy and
murder in the hijacking. Thirty-nine Americans were held captive
for 17 days U.S. Navy diver Robert Stetham was killed in the ordeal.
   Today's main witness was Gabriel Lapite, who was imprisoned on
drug charges in a cell near Hamadi's from January to March of last
year.
   Lapite testified that Hamadi gave him the telephone number of a
sister in Beirut with the request: ``Tell her that my brother
should start to go to work. Both Germans should not be freed unless
I am released.''
   Lapite did not say which of Hamadi's brothers was to be
contacted. He did not say if he placed the phone call, and Chief
Judge Heiner Mueckenberger did not ask him.
   However, Lapite did testify that Mohammed Hamadi gave him five
letters to mail to family members and friends. Lapite said he did
not mail the letters and handed them over to police.
   Reiner Hamm, a lawyer representing hijack victims and their
families in the trial, said the letters attempted to arrange
Hamadi's release from prison.
   One of Hamadi's brothers, Abdul Hadi Hamadi, is Beirut security
chief for Hezbollah, a radical Shiite Moslem organization suspected
of holding Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Another brother, Abbas Hamadi, was arrested in January 1987 at
Frankfurt airport and convicted in April of kidnapping the two West
Germans. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison.
   Prosecutors say the kidnappings in January 1987 were aimed at
forcing West Germany to free Mohammed Ali Hamadi. They occurred
just a few days after Mohammed Ali Hamadi was arrested at
Frankfurt's airport after being caught with explosives.
   One West German, Alfred Schmidt, was released in September, but
the second, Rudolf Cordes, remains a hostage.
   Cordes is one of 18 Westerners, including nine Americans, held
hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
   There was no court session Wednesday.
   The defendant told the court on Tuesday that he had been sick
and wants treatment, but he did not want to discuss his ailment
publicly.
   Court spokesman Falk Thomas said Hamadi has requested hospital
treatment when the court recesses for four weeks on Aug. 9. Thomas
would not specify the nature of the illness.
   Also on Tuesday, Judge Mueckenberger read from a report police
prepared after questioning witness Hamza Kassim about a
conversation with Hamadi's older brother, Abbas.
   The report quoted Kassim as telling police that he had been told
by Abbas that Mohammed was arrested ``because he was a hijacker of
the American plane.''
   Questioned by the judge about his statement, Kassim said he
could not remember saying it.
   ``Are you afraid to repeat it?'' Mueckenberger asked.
   ``No, but I can't remember now,'' Kassim said.
   Kassim said he was a Palestinian who lived in Lebanon before
coming to Germany in 1979. He now lives in the town of Merzig in
Saarland state, near the former residence of Abbas Hamadi.
   Mueckenberger said police questioned Kassim after Mohammed
Hamadi's arrest, but he did not specify the date.

<HEAD>FBI Hopes New Program Will Help Reduce Demand for Illegal Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William Sessions said today his
agency hopes a new program will help reduce the demand for illegal
drugs across the nation.
   Under the program, which began in April, one FBI agent in each
of the bureau's 58 field offices has been assigned to work with
local, state, school and business officials to educate the public
about the dangers of drugs.
   ``The bureau expanded its own view in the belief that we could
have a meaningful impact on demand reduction,'' Sessions told a
news conference.
   Agents in the field offices will spend only part of their time
on the drug program, according to Bob Davenport, an FBI official
who is directing the low-budget, $200,000 program.
   ``I think we have finally turned the corner in public
awareness,'' Davenport said.
   On another matter, Sessions said he will discuss with members of
Congress early next month a report on the FBI's investigation of a
group opposed to President Reagan's Central America policies.
   Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said in February that he
was confident that the FBI did not conduct a massive spying
campaign into the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador, or CISPES.
   Members of Congress have complained that the investigation was
mishandled.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
arrived in Uruguay today for talks with top officials on drug
trafficking, the nation's eonomy and regional issues such as
Central America.
   Shultz arrived in Montevideo from Buenos Aires, where he said
relations between Argentina and the United States have improved.
   Several Marxist-controlled political, union and student
organizations have criticized the Shultz visit and threatened
demonstrations. After 11 hours in Uruguay, the third stop on his
nine-country Latin America tour, Shultz planned to fly to Brazil.
   Relations between the Unitd States and Argentina were strained
when the United States sided with Britain and against Argentina in
the 1982 Falklands War.
   ``There may be some wounds, but they are healing and that's what
we want to have happen,'' Shultz told a news conference in Buenos
Aires on Wednesday.
   In Argentina, Shultz met top government officials, businessmen
and political figures and dined privately with President Raul
Alfonsin.
   Defense Minister Horacion Jaunarena accepted an invitation,
delivered by Shultz from U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, to
visit the United States this fall.
   The aim of Shultz's trip was to acknowlege a country that after
years of cool relations has become an ally and friend and to call
attention to Argentina's return to democracy.
   Generals and admirals ruled Argentina for most of the two
decades leading up to Alfonsin's election in October 1983 and
inauguration five weeks later.
   Most people who spoke with Shultz focused on Argentina's
economic problems and asked what the United States might do to help
overcome a $56 billion foreign debt and triple-digit inflation.
   Shultz's solution: the free market system.
   ``If you want to see economic development in a country, then
what needs to be done is to lighten up the regulatory load ...
privatize economic incentives, get tax rates down, get fiscal
policies into reasonable shape,'' he said.
   Shultz acknowleged that Argentina has asked the United States to
support a $500 million bridge loan, but refused to comment on the
status of the loan.
   He told the three main presidential candidates that the United
States would support whoever freely wins elections set for next
year to replace Alfonsin.
   ``What the United States supports is the process, the democratic
process,'' Shultz told reporters at the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Theodore Gildred. ``The outcome of the process is for
the people of Argentina to decide.''
   After lengthy meetings for two days, Shultz took time off
Wednesday to attend with his wife a cookout at a ranch in the heart
of this beef-producing country and tour Colon Theatre, Buenos
Aires' 80-year-old opera house.
   Britain and Argentina fought the 74-day Falklands War over
jurisdiction of islands in the South Atlantic. Argentina started
the war by attacking a British post and moving in 11,000 troops.
Britain retook the islands and won.

<TEXT>
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle of Panama met last
month with an envoy sent by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and is
ready to negotiate to ease the country's crisis, The Miami Herald
reported today.
   Jose Blandon, a Panamian exile who was close to Noriega until
his defection earlier this year, told the Herald that he spoke with
Delvalle by telephone on Wednesday, and ``President Delvalle told
me that Noriega sent an emissary to him last month in the hope of
starting a negotiating process.
   ``He is ready to meet with Noriega to find a political
solution.''
   According to Blandon, Delvalle, who is living in hiding in
Panama since he was ousted earlier this year by Noriega, will
release a document this week announcing ``his willingness to
negotiate'' with Noriega.
   Noriega ``knows that only Delvalle can ask the U.S. government
to lift the U.S. economic sanctions against Panama,'' Blandon said.
The United States still recognizes Delvalle as the head of state
despite his ouster.
   Juan Sosa, the Delvalle appointee still recognized in Washington
as Panama's ambassador told the Herald that Delvalle had telephoned
him Wednesday to tell him about the meeting.
   Delvalle dismissed Noriega as defense chief Feb. 25, but was
ousted the following day by a vote in the Noriega-dominated
National Assembly.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
ended a four-day visit to the Soviet Union today by boarding the
pride of the Black Sea Fleet, a new missile cruise capable of
carrying up to 16 nuclear weapons.
   Carlucci and Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov toured the
561-foot cruiser Slava docked in this important port on the Crimean
Peninsula 800 miles from Moscow.
   A U.S. naval officer said the defense secretary was the first
American official to board the cruiser.
   After inspection of the cruiser, Carlucci headed to Ankara,
Turkey, where he planned talks on Turkish-U.S. defense cooperation.
   Carlucci's visit to the Soviet Union was marked by a more open
posture by the Soviet military, which permitted close inspection of
some previously secret Kremlin hardware and military bases.
   However, Carlucci indicated on the first day of his visit that
he had his doubts about the Soviet peace initiative.
   Before 200 of the Kremlin's top brass, he said he has yet to see
evidence of a claimed change in Soviet military strategy to a
doctrine of defense.
   He also visited the Kubinka Air Force Base for the first look by
a Western official at the top-secret Blackjack bomber, then watched
Soviet war games at the Taman motorized rifle division base
southwest of the capital.
   Sevastopol was the last stop for Carlucci on his Soviet tour.
Earlier he toured an opulent mansion built by Russian Czar
Alexander III in a small town four miles from Yalta.
   He met there with President Andrei A. Gromyko in what Carlucci
called constructive talks. The defense secretary did not reveal the
nature of the talks, but said they touched on arms control.

<TEXT>
   Fire today destroyed what was to be the
first black fraternity house at the University of Mississippi.
   The cause of the blaze at the vacant house was under
investigation by the state fire marshal's office, said fire Capt.
Ronnie Mills.
   The 20-member Phi Beta Sigma fraternity had planned to move in
to the two-story house later his month after winning approval to
become the first black tenants among the approximately 16
antebellum-style houses on Fraternity Row.
   ``There is no reason to expect any foul play at all. People are
going to make that assumption, but it's simply an old house and we
don't know what happened,'' said university spokesman Ed Meek.
   No utilities were connected at the house, and no one was
believed inside when the fire was reported at 3:28 a.m., he said.
Meek said the 50-year-old house had been vacant for some time.
   Some fraternity members who came to the house today declined to
comment. Phi Beta Sigma chapter adviser Thomas Wallace of New
Albany does not have a listed telephone number and couldn't
immediately be reached for comment.
   Meek said the state College Board recently approved leasing the
house to the black fraternity. He said the lease hadn't been signed
yet, but fraternity members had been allowed in in the past few
days to prepare to move in.
   ``It's a total loss. There's brick walls left on the outside,
but everything else is gutted,'' Meek said.
   Ann Cook, associate commissioner of higher education for the
state College Board, was among the educators who had applauded the
prospect of a black fraternity at Ole Miss, where riots broke out
in 1962 when James Meredith became the first black student to
register at the school.
   ``We feel like it just shows the new change in Mississippi _ the
new Mississippi,'' Cook said when the lease was approved.
   Meek said he didn't know if there were other vacant houses on
Fraternity Row that could be offered to the black fraternity. He
said the school will do its best to find other accommodations
before the students start arriving Aug. 20.

   It will take ``a considerable amount of time''
to determine how to compensate families of the 290 people killed
last month when a U.S. Navy missile destroyed a civilian Iranian
jetliner over the Persian Gulf, Reagan administration officials
said today.
   Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said a conclusion that human mistakes in
the midst of combat caused the United States to shoot down the
plane could persuade Congress to approve the compensation.
   Pentagon sources said Wednesday that preliminary findings show
human error rather than malfunctioning equipment caused the Navy
warship Vincennes to fire on the Iran Air jetliner July 3.
   Testifying before the Armed Services Committee today, Abraham
Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser, said the
administration will work as quickly as possible to fufill President
Reagan's promise that humanitarian compensation will be paid.
   But Sofaer terstified:
   ``We will need a considerable amount of time to determine how to
assess compensation and to obtain the information necessary from
the families or their governments.''
   While aiming to make tha payments promptly, he said, the United
States must also ``satisfy all professional and legal requirements
before making any payment, including obtaining legislative
authority if necessary or desirable.''
   Aspin said earlier that he has not seen a report that, according
to the sources, concludes there was no problem with the
sophisticated Aegis air-defense radar system on the USS Vincennes.
   ``If it turns out the United States is totally responsible and
human error was the responsibility, I think it will tilt the
chances of ... Congress going along with the idea of compensation,
not to the government but to the families,'' Aspin said on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America.''
   One Pentagon official said, ``The biggest question when this
started was whether Aegis worked properly, and the inquiry has
found no evidence of a malfunction.'' Another official said the
inquiry determined there was ``no problem with the Aegis.''
   The defense officials agreed to discuss the preliminary findings
into the tragedy only on condition they not be identified. The
Vincennes shot down the airliner shortly after it had taken off
from a military and civilian airfield in Iran. All 290 passengers
and crew aboard the plane were killed.
   The sources stressed that the findings of the investigative team
that just returned from the gulf had yet to be accepted formally or
``endorsed'' by military brass or Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci.
   ``But this (explanation) is very plausible,'' one source said.
``People underestimate the human factor and stress. You can't
replicate that in exercises and training.''
   The Vincennes, one of the Navy's newest and most sophisticated
ships, fired on the Iranian airliner after concluding it was an
Iranian jet fighter. The Vincennes' crew classified the approaching
radar ``contact'' as hostile and when the plane failed to respond
to radio warnings, the ship's skipper gave the order to open fire.
   The classification of that radar contact as hostile appears to
have been made by crewmen in the heat of battle without adequate
technical justification, one official said. There is no evidence
the Aegis radar system malfunctioned or that it presented technical
data to justify the ``hostile'' classification, the source
explained.
   ``Perhaps, understandably, there was misinterpretation,''
another official said.
   The ship was on high alert; Iranian fighters had been detected
operating from the same airfield in Iran just a short time earlier,
and the Vincennes had just survived its first combat action in the
gulf, a fight with three Iranian gunboats.
   Very quickly, almost upon takeoff, the plane was classified as
hostile, a source said.
   ``Here you had a bunch of people believing that the inbound was
hostile and thought to be a threat,'' the official said. ``So here
you've got a mindset.
   ``And you've got something (a contact) that obviously was not
responding to warnings, which further suggests that it might be
hostile. It's not as simple as just saying human error. They didn't
purposely shoot down an airliner.''
   The Pentagon refused to discuss the matter Wednesday, saying the
findings were still being reviewed by Gen. George B. Crist, the
head of the U.S. Central Command, and had yet to be forwarded to
Washington.
   Crist must decide whether to accept the findings of his
investigative team, which was led by Rear Adm. William Fogarty, the
Pentagon noted.
   President Reagan, in a brief question-and-answer exchange with
reporters, also declined to comment on the matter.
   ``I have read and heard and seen what is being said about the
report and assigning the blame to the people in the radar room
interpreting the signals and all,'' the president said.
   ``I can't comment because neither the military nor my office has
received the report,'' Reagan said.
   The sources said Wednesday the written report and documentary
evidence were still in Crist's hands, but that a few defense
officials _ including Carlucci _ had received oral briefings on the
status of the work.
   The New York Times, in a report Wednesday, said it appeared the
Vincennes crew mistook an electronic identification signal from a
C-130 aircraft at Bandar Abbas to be from the passenger airliner.
   The sources contacted by The Associated Press declined comment
on that aspect of the inquiry and also refused to say whether
investigators had advanced any explanation for the failure of the
Iranian airliner to respond to the Vincennes' radio warnings.

   A tropical storm watch was posted for the
120,000 residents of Hawaii Island as a ``dangerous'' Hurricane
Fabio and its 125 mph gusts churned toward the Hawaiian Islands
today, forecasters said.
   At 2 a.m. today (8 a.m. EDT) the storm's center was 530 miles
east-southeast of Hilo and 740 miles east-southeast of Honolulu,
with a course and speed that would bring it just south of Hawaii,
the southernmost island in the chain, on Friday.
   If the course and speed remained unchanged, it would be near
Oahu, the most populous island of 850,000 where Honolulu is
located, on Saturday, forecasters said.
   Maximum sustained winds were 105 mph, with tropical force winds
between 39 mph and 73 mph extending 180 miles from the center. The
intensity diminished from early Wednesday when gusts reached 175
mph.
   ``It's a large storm and quite intense,'' said Hans Rosendal, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Honolulu.
   ``It likely will come quite close to the islands. It is still a
dangerous storm.''
   A track up the chain's western side would bring the more intense
and dangerous side of the storm over the islands, he said.
   Although the storm had not weakened in six hours, Rosendal said
storms usually diminish in strength as they move away from the
equator and over cooler waters.
   Supermarkets contacted around the state Wednesday said they had
not noticed any big rush to buy items as batteries, candles,
charcoal or canned goods that Civil Defense officials advised
residents to have on hand.
   Observers assigned to spend Wednesday night on Hawaii Island's
east coast to watch for rising surf generated by the approaching
storm reported no problems, said Bruce Butts, operations officer
for the Hawaii County Civil Defense.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
skirted Oahu and ran over Kauai and Niihau in November 1982 with
117 mph winds, causing $234 million damage. There were no deaths
officially attributed to that storm.

   The House voted 257-156 today to approve
legislation giving $20,000 tax-free payments to thousands of
Japanese-Americans who were rounded up and sent to internment camps
at the outbreak of World War II.
   The bill now goes to the White House, where President Reagan has
said he will sign it, ending ``a sad chapter in American history.''
   With the money will come an apology from the U.S. government for
having forced about 120,000 Japanese-Americans _ both citizens and
resident aliens _ from their homes and jobs following the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The payments will begin in about a year and will total about
$1.25 billion. Individual payments to the estimated 60,000
surviving internees will be made over a 10-year period, with the
most elderly getting priority.
   In return for the money, those who qualify must agree to drop
any legal claims against the government stemming from the
internment.
   The legislation also authorizes payments of up to $12,000 each
for surviving members of the Aleut Indian tribes who were removed
from the Aleutian Islands during the Japanese attack there in 1942.
   Rep. Norman Y. Mineta, D-Calif., who himself spent part of his
youth in an internment camp in Wyoming, said ``this legislation
touches all of us, because it touches the very core of our nation.''
   Mineta, who took the speaker's chair to preside over the vote,
said passage ended ``many years of prayers and struggles and
dreams.''
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., an earlier opponent of the payments,
said before the vote that he had changed his mind. ``I see this as
an important national apology. ... It is a time for apology and
reunification and I intend to be a part of it.''
   The internment camps arose from a 1942 order by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt that said the War Department could designate
military areas from which people could be excluded.
   Later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of
Japanese ancestry from California, Washington and Oregon, and some
in Hawaii. The orders affected 77,000 U.S. citizens and 43,000
legal and illegal resident aliens. All were taken to prison camps
in the Western states.
   The last camp was closed in January 1946.

   Missy Hasson's baby was due today,
but her license tag was due for renewal in June, so a police
officer impounded her car and left her by the road eight miles from
home.
   Mrs. Hasson, her 2-year-old son and her disabled mother were out
of the car and on the street after being stopped Tuesday. The
temperature was 93.
   ``It was very routine,'' said Officer Thomas A. Noonan. ``I've
arrested pregnant women before, and I've had their cars towed
before.''
   He said he knew Mrs. Hasson was pregnant when he approached the
car. He said he didn't know Mrs. Hasson's mother, Mary Ann Fetters,
42, was disabled until after he called a tow truck and Mrs. Hasson
opened the trunk to get a wheelchair.
   Fetters has suffered for 18 months from Lou Gehrig's disease,
her daughter said. She cannot walk, talk or feed herself, she said.
   Mrs. Hasson, 21, got her mother into the wheelchair, positioned
her son, Daniel Jr., on her mother's lap, and pushed them across a
busy four-lane highway to a nearby bowling alley, where she called
a friend for a ride home.
   ``He (Noonan) didn't help us at all,'' Mrs. Hanson said.
   Noonan, a police officer in northern Kentucky for four years,
defended his action and said the conditions of Mrs. Hasson and her
mother had no bearing on the citation for having an expired tag or
the decision to impound the car.

   Toshiwo Doko, who helped revitalize Japanese
manufacturing firms after the war and promote the nation's recent
administrative and fiscal reform, died Thursday at the age of 91.
   Doko served as president of Toshiba Corp., the electronics
giant, and oversaw the privatization of Japan's railways.
   Born in southwestern Okayama city in 1896, Doko joined the Tokyo
Ishikawajima Shipyard, later renamed Ishikawajima Heavy Industries
Co., following his graduation from the Tokyo Higher Technical
School.
   Doko became president of Ishikawajima Heavy Industries in 1950
and helped rescue the firm from a recession.
   In 1964, Doko became chairman of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Co., a major heavy machinery maker, and was named
president of Toshiba the following year.
   From 1974 to 1980, Doko served as chairman of the powerful
Federation of Economic Organizatons, Keidanren, which groups about
1,000 major Japanese companies. While at Keidanren, Doko led
delegations to the Soviet Union and China.
   Doko was appointed chairman of the Prime Minister's Advisory
Council on Administrative Reform in 1981, and his group submitted a
recommendation two years later which led to the division of the
state-run Japan National Railways into several private companies in
1987.

   Senate Democrats are proposing a new aid
package for Nicaragua's Contra rebels that defers a decision on
whether to resume the flow of U.S. weapons, but Republicans said
today they are wary because the deal gives too much influence to
House Speaker Jim Wright.
   The White House rejected the Democratic plan outright.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it failed to provide
``any real hope for freedom and democracy in Nicaragua.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., commented,
``Nobody trusts the speaker.'' He said Wright has reneged on past
promises as to when and how he would bring Contra aid to the House
floor.
   Republican senators _ along with Democratic Contra aid supporter
David Boren _ met today in Dole's office with National Security
Adviser Colin Powell to work out a strategy for reaching a
bipartisan agreement on an aid package that would give Wright less
discretion over whether lethal aid will ultimately flow to the
rebels.
   ``There are some clear differences'' between the two sides,
Powell said after the meeting. ``There's always room for a
compromise. We have to have a Contra aid bill'' before Congress
adjourns this fall.
   Fitzwater told reporters the Democratic proposal ``falls far
short. ... Humanitarian aid is too limited, too narrowly defined,
to be of any real help.''
   Drafting a bill that would win approval without giving Wright
what the Republicans feel is too much power is ``the No. 1
question,'' said Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Added Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said, ``If cousin Jim doesn't sign on
this thing, it's not worth the paper it's written on.''
   On Wednesday, Dole said: ``No one elected Speaker Wright
president. I will not be a party to giving him a unilateral veto
over our national security policies in Central America.''
   The Democratic proposal, completed Wednesday, gave the party its
first show of unity on the aid issue in seven years.
   But the step goes only halfway to the goal Majority Leader
Robert Byrd was seeking: a bipartisan accord that will tell Central
America that the United States favors a peaceful solution, and at
the same time blunt the issue's political impact throughout the
fall election season.
   Byrd said his aid package, worked out over two weeks of
discussions with more than a dozen Senate Democrats, would provide
the incentives both the Contras and the leftist Sandinista
government need to achieve success in their faltering peace effort.
   ``This legislation can go either way,'' Byrd, D-W.Va., told
reporters as he announced the agreement at a news conference. It
can reward Nicaragua with aid and trade for making peace and
democratic reforms, or it can provide the fuel for the Contras to
resume their war on the Managua regime, he said.
   Peace talks have been suspended in an atmosphere of growing
tension since the last session between the two sides broke up in
disagreement June 9.
   The Sandinistas have arrested opposition leaders, shut down
opposition media outlets and expelled U.S. diplomats in recent
weeks. The Contras have elected a new, harder-line political
directorate and have been accused of carrying out attacks in the
countryside in violation of an informal cease-fire.
   Appearing at the news conference with Byrd were half a dozen
Democrats all along the spectrum on the Contra aid issue, from aid
proponent Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., to staunch opponents like
Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``This is the first time in seven years the Democrats have come
together'' on the issue, Dodd said. But he acknowledged that the
unity was in large measure because the thorniest issue _ whether to
resume sending weapons to the rebels _ is deferred for a later vote
under terms of the proposal.
   The Democratic proposal would provide an additional $27 million
in ``humanitarian'' aid _ food, clothing, shelter and medical
supplies _ to continue current rates of such aid through next March.
   It also promises economic and trade assistance for Nicaragua if
the Managua government goes along with ``a comprehensive final
agreement to provide for peace and democracy in Nicaragua.''
   Conversely, some $16.3 million worth of stockpiled weaponry
could be released to the rebels if President Reagan certifies
before Congress adjourns for the year that two of three conditions
are met:
   _The Sandinistas have continued their recent pattern of
repression of political opponents and otherwise violated terms of
last year's regional peace agreement.
   _Nicaragua continues to receive an ``unacceptable level'' of
weaponry from Soviet-bloc countries, including Cuba.
   _The Sandinistas have launched an ``unprovoked military attack''
on the Contras.
   But the weapons, withheld from delivery to rebel forces since
the two sides entered a cease-fire earlier this year, would not be
released unless both houses of Congress voted to accept Reagan's
certification.
   The House, which traditionally has been more opposed to lethal
aid for the rebels, would have to vote first on the presidential
certification, and that appeared to be high on Dole's list of
objections.
   Dole's aid proposal would provide the same $27 million in
humanitarian aid for the rebels, but also would create a separate,
new $20 million military aid fund that would be held in escrow, to
be triggered by a later vote of Congress if circumstances in
Central America warrant.
   The Democratic proposal would provide up to $2 million to
transport the stockpiled weapons, which are left over from an
earlier $100 million lethal aid appropriation. The transportation
presumably would be handled by the CIA, which handled air drops to
the Contras under the administration's earlier covert aid program.
   Other features of the Democratic plan include up to $10 million
for use in relocating Contra fighters to Nicaragua if the two sides
sign a peace accord providing for democracy there, and $5 million
in medical aid to the civilian population in Nicaragua.

   ``It happens now and then because they may not understand that

   Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., found guilty
Thursday of all but one of 16 counts including conspiracy,
extortion, tax evasion and receiving bribes in the Wedtech
corruption scandal, is the 12th member of congress to be convicted
of criminal charges or plead guilty to them during the past decade.
   Biaggi, 70, also was convicted Sept. 22, 1987, of obstructing
justice, accepting a gratuity, and illegal interstate travel in a
case involving charges he had accepted paid vacations from a former
leader of the Brooklyn Democratic Party. Biaggi was acquitted of
more serious bribery and conspiracy charges.
   The 10-term Bronx congressman was the 15th federal lawmaker to
be indicted over the past decade, and the second one indicted in
1987.
   The other congressman to be indicted in 1987, Rep. Harold E.
Ford, D- Tenn., was charged in April of last year with bank, mail
and tax fraud.
   Other members of Congress indicted since early 1977:
   _Rep. Charles C. Diggs Jr., D-Mich., was indicted in March 1978
and convicted in October 1978 on 29 felony counts of illegally
diverting his congressional employees' salaries to his personal
use. Censured by the House in 1979, Diggs resigned from Congress in
1980 and served seven months of a three-year prison sentence.
   _Rep. Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa., was indicted in the fall of 1978
on 13 counts of bribery, conspiracy and perjury. His trial on 11
counts ended in mistrial in February 1979, and he resigned from the
House in January 1980 for health reasons, after the House ethics
committee had accused him of 25 violations of House rules. In
February 1980, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy, in a
plea-bargaining arrangement, and was given a year's probation.
   _Rep. Joshua Eilberg, D-Pa., was indicted in October 1978 on
federal charges of illegally receiving compensation to help a
Philadelphia hospital get a $14.5 million federal grant. He pleaded
guilty in February 1979 and was sentenced to five years' probation
and fined $10,000.
   _Rep. Claude ``Buddy'' Leach, D-La., was indicted in July 1979
on charges of buying votes in the 1978 elections, and was accused
of violating federal campaign finance laws. He was acquitted of
some vote-buying counts and the others were dropped, and a court
dismissed the charges of campaign finance law violations.
   _Sen. Harrison Williams Jr., D-N.J., was convicted in May 1981
on charges stemming from the FBI's Abscam investigation, including
conspiracy, bribery, conflict of interest, receiving an unlawful
gratuity and interstate travel in aid of a racketeering enterprise.
   Williams resigned from the Senate in March 1982. He was paroled
from a Newark, N.J., halfway house in January 1986 after serving
nearly two years of a three-year sentence at the federal
penitentiary at Allenwood, Pa.
   Six House members also were indicted as a result of the
undercover Abscam investigation, and all served prison terms. They
were:
   Rep. Raymond Lederer, D-Pa., was convicted in January 1981 of
conspiracy, bribery, receiving an unlawful gratuity and interstate
travel to further racketeering; Rep. Michael Myers, D-Pa., was
convicted in August 1980 of conspiracy, bribery and interstate
travel; Rep. John Jenrette, D-S.C., was convicted in October 1980
of sharing a $50,000 bribe.
   Also, Rep. John Murphy, D-N.Y., was convicted in December 1980
of conspiracy, conflict of interest and receiving an unlawful
gratuity; Rep. Frank Thompson, D-N.J., was convicted in December
1980 of bribery, conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the
acceptance of a criminal gratuity; Rep. Richard Kelly, R-Fla., was
convicted in Januery 1981 of taking a $25,000 bribe from an
undercover FBI agent and of taking part in a $250,000 bribery
conspiracy.
   _Rep. George Hansen, R-Idaho, indicted in April 1983 and
convicted one year later on charges of violating the 1978 Ethics in
Government Act by failing to report $333,978 in loans and other
transactions on his financial disclosure forms. He surrendered June
20, 1986, to begin serving a sentence of 5 to 15 months at the
federal correctional facility at Petersburg, Va., and was released
on parole Dec. 19, 1986.
   _Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, R-Calif., was indicted Jan. 23, 1986, along
with aide on charges she tried to buy off an opponent for the GOP
Senate nomination in California. The charges subsequently were
dismissed by a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles, and she lost
the GOP primary.

   A boatload of Soviets and Americans will
steam down the Mississippi River from St. Louis this week in a
cruise organized by peace groups in both countries.
   During a nine-day trip to New Orleans, 50 Soviets and 125
Americans will get to know one another during workshops on
``perestroika, glasnost and democratization'' and ``social issues
and human rights,'' among others.
   ``We're trying to avoid a nuclear holocaust,'' said Lou
Friedman, spokesman for Promoting Enduring Peace of Woodmont,
Conn., the cruise's U.S. sponsor.
   ``The two nuclear superpowers as antagonists destabilize the
nuclear situation in the world terribly. So ... the one thing that
can help this situation is for Americans and Soviets to get to know
each other.''
   The cruise begins Friday in St. Louis and ends in the French
Quarter on Aug. 14, one day before the Republican National
Convention. That is coincidence _ plans for the cruise began a year
before those for the GOP convention, said Friedman.
   A similar group cruised the upper Mississippi, from St. Paul to
St. Louis, in 1986.
   ``We'd come into a dock on the upper Mississippi at 2 o'clock in
the morning 25 miles from nowhere and it was pouring rain,'' he
said. ``There'd be 200 people waiting their to greet the Soviets.
For four hours they'd be waiting in the rain. Grandfathers who'd
fought in the second World War who wanted their grandchildren to
see the Soviets.''
   American participants applied through one of a dozen U.S. peace
groups and the Soviets through the Soviet Peace Committee, which
Friedman said has organized eight similar cruises along the Volga
River since 1982.
   Most of the Americans are paying their own ways; the Soviet
Peace Committee pays airfare, cabin fare _ $1,729 to $3,189 _ and
other expenses for the Soviets, Friedman said.
   This summer's drought may make a stop planned Saturday at Cape
Giradeau, Mo., impossible if the river is still too low. Other
stops are planned Tuesday at Memphis, Tenn.; Wednesday at
Greenville, Miss.; Thursdsay at Vicksburg, Miss.; Friday at
Natchez, Miss.; and Aug. 13 at Baton Rouge.

   The University of Minnesota's chief
heart-lung surgeon has temporarily stepped down from his leadership
posts amid controversy generated by an article a newspaper now
regrets publishing.
   The Star Tribune today said running the story was a ``serious
lapse in journalistic judgment.''
   The newspaper reported Tuesday that Dr. Stuart Jamieson was
being investigated by the university for allegedly ordering an
associate to perform bypass surgery on a patient considered dead
before the operation began.
   The University of Minnesota issued a statement Wednesday saying
Jamieson was stepping aside temporarily from his positions as head
of cardiovascular surgery and director of the university's Heart
and Lung Institute.
   Jamieson and University Hospital's chief of staff and general
director have ``discussed a set of expectations regarding
compliance with hospital policy and procedure and medical staff
standards,'' the university said.
   In a front-page statement today, Star Tribune executive editor
Joel Kramer said the account of the surgery should not have been
published ``because it was based on sources who did not have
firsthand information to support the account.''
   ``The surgeon who performed the operation, Dr. Jolene Kriett,
has since denied that Dr. Jamieson knew anything about the surgery
until several hours after it was performed,'' Kramer said. ``The
Star Tribune's efforts to reach Dr. Kriett before publication of
the first story were unsuccessful, and Dr. Jamieson had refused to
comment.
   ``Publishing the account of the events, when we had not
confirmed it with anyone having firsthand knowledge of the facts,
was a serious lapse in journalistic judgment, which we regret,'' he
said.
   Jamieson, 40, who came to the university two years ago from
Stanford University, will continue in his academic position as
surgery professor and will continue as a member of the medical
staff of the University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic, the
university statement said.
   Jamieson could not be reached for comment because he left on a
two-week vacation Wednesday. The statement said hospital
authorities had no further comment.
   However, the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch quoted sources as
saying Jamieson was asked to step down from the leadership roles.
The newspaper said there has been a sharp dispute over his
personality and aggressive management style.
   Kriett told the Star Tribune and the Pioneer Press Dispatch
Tuesday night that she did not consult with Jamieson before
deciding to operate on a 43-year-old woman whose heart had stopped
beating five times before surgery began.
   ``It sure didn't happen as it was reported in the paper,'' the
Pioneer Press Dispatch quoted Kriett as saying. ``I was the one on
call and it was my own decision.''
   Dr. Neal Vanselow, university vice president for health
sciences, said Wednesday that the university is ``looking into some
allegations against Jamieson, and the Kriett surgery is one of
them.''
   Kriett said she canceled the surgery after the patient's heart
stopped beating but decided a few minutes later to proceed with the
operation in a final attempt to save the woman's life.

   The Navy said Thursday it is banning topless
dancers and other sexually oriented entertainment at base clubs for
officers and sailors, in response to charges that it encourages
abusive behavior toward women.
   The prohibition, contained in revised regulations for Navy mess
operations, was signed June 30 by Vice Adm. Leon A. Edney, the
chief of naval personnel, and distributed to Navy bases around the
world.
   The Navy said the move was approved by Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost,
chief of naval operations, and is effective immediately.
   The new guidelines specify that all entertainment at base clubs
must meet ``appropriate standards of discretion, modesty and good
taste.''
   Base commanders should use common sense to make sure their clubs
feature only ``wholesome and high-quality entertainment'' suitable
for a ``typical mixed community audience.''
   ``Entertainment that could conceivably result in embarrassment
to the (Navy) shall be avoided,'' the new rules say.
   ``Female topless and-or bottomless exhibition, as well as male
bottomless and other similar entertainment, is prohibited.''
   The revised rules were recommended last fall by a panel created
by Navy Secretary James H. Webb to survey the status of service
women after another group _ the Defense Advisory Committee on Women
in the Services _ issued a blistering critique of the Navy's
treatment of females within its ranks and in the Marines.
   The advisory panel concluded that Navy and Marine Corps women
serving in the Pacific frequently were victims of sexual harassment
and abuse and appeared to be stuck in dead-end assignments offering
little opportunity for advancement.
   Webb's study group, comprised of 28 male and female officers and
enlisted personnel, largely verified those findings.
   The advisory panel pointedly complained about such base
activities as ``noon-time burlesque shows and `dining-ins' that
emphasize sexually oriented entertainment ...''
   ``The issue of moral acceptability aside, on-base activities
such as these contribute to creating an environment in which all
females are regarded with less or no respect and abusive behavior
toward all women is not only passively accepted and condoned but
encouraged.''
   The Navy said Thursday that Edney's directive was intended to
address that complaint and was endorsed by the female members of
Webb's study group.
   The directive says club managers should consider ``local mess
patronage, the probable participants and potential media reaction''
in selecting club entertainment acts.
   The new rules also apply to performers hired for private parties
at base clubs. Anyone who reserves space for a private party must
give the club manager the ``full particulars'' of entertainment
plans, the directive says.
   ``Regardless of the type of entertainment that may be offered in
the local community, it is not in the best interest of the Navy to
allow standards of taste in entertainment to seek their own level
on the assumption that anything that people desire is allowable,''
it says.
   ``The commanding officer will ensure ... that any type of
attraction that does not provide wholesome and high-quality
entertainment shall not be allowed to perform in the mess.''

   A general imprisoned in 1977 for passing Swiss
military secrets to the Soviet Union and reviled as one of this
neutral nation's worst traitors was freed Thursday after serving
about two-thirds of his term.
   Officials said Brig. Gen. Jean-Louis Jeanmaire, 78, was released
on probation for good behavior. He had been sentenced to 18 years.
   Jeanmaire always portrayed himself as a fervent anti-communist,
has tried twice to have his case reopened, and has said in recent
interviews he would continue the effort to clear his name.
   The secret military court that convicted him said he was not
motivated by ideology or financial gain, but by weakness of
character, vanity and resentment about a delayed promotion.
   It found Jeanmaire guilty on June 17, 1977, of passing vital
defense information to Soviet diplomats in Bern, the Swiss capital,
between 1962 and 1975. The sentence, including expulsion from the
army, was the stiffest ever given on a Swiss citizen for peacetime
espionage.
   Prosecutors said he did ``irreparable harm'' and gave away
information of ``highest importance.'' A government report said he
betrayed mobilization plans for Switzerland's militia army.
   After his release from Bellechasse prison in Fribourg canton
northeast of Geneva, Jeanmaire was reached by telephone at his Bern
apartment and told The Associated Press he would not comment for a
few days. He is expected to spend the time celebrating with friends.
   The conservative Neue Zuercher Zeitung said Thursday: ``One can
assume the Jeanmaire case will not come to rest so soon. A veil of
uncertainty will always stay over the affair since the files must
for understandable reasons remain secret.''
   When he retired in 1975, Jeanmaire headed the air raid
protection corps. It was a non-combat unit, but he was a member of
the general staff and had inside knowledge of all army branches.
   Jeanmaire was under surveillance by federal police for a year
before his arrest Aug. 9, 1976, on a street in Lausanne. Two months
later, before a preliminary investigation was completed, Justice
Minister Kurt Furgler spoke of in Parliament of ``an abominable
deed.''
   Col. Vassily Denissenko was the central Soviet figure. He was a
military attache at the Bern embassy in 1959-64 who won Jeanmaire's
confidence and friendship.
   Marie-Louise Jeanmaire, the general's wife, was acquitted of
complicity. The defense said Denissenko seduced Mrs. Jeanmaire, who
has died since the trial, but prosecutors accused her of willingly
helping her husband.
   The case was said to have been broken by a tip from West German
intelligence. It caused a national furor in Switzerland, where the
army is accorded great respect.
   Jeanmaire told the court in a closing statement he was caught up
in the affair unwittingly and was too frightened to inform
authorities.
   Swiss media revived the case as his release drew near and some
newspapers repeated suggestions by his supporters that the
brigadier was the scapegoat in a coverup by superiors.
   A statement Tuesday from the Federal Prosecutor's Office
dismissed this argument as ``contention, speculation and absurd
portrayals,'' but indicated the secrecy requirement precluded a
detailed rebuttal.
   In a TV interview broadcast Tuesday, Jeanmaire said he delivered
only minor data with the purpose of promoting military deterrence
by proving Switzerland's preparedness to Moscow.
   Andre Perret, his lawyer, claimed the pressure of public opinion
produced an excessive sentence.
   Blick, a tabloid, quoted Jeanmaire recently as saying: ``I was
not guilty as convicted. It was never my intention to commit
treason. My case was played up and they had to follow through,
until I was sentenced.''
   By contrast, the Neue Zuercher Zeitung commented: ``The fact
remains that the ex-brigadier general, among other things, passed
secret documents to Soviet military attaches. He was sentenced by a
proper military court in proper proceedings.''
   The independent Basler Zeitung said: ``Jeanmaire was never a
`spy of the century.' But in the same vein, his sentence was not a
`scandal of the century.'''

   The West, a graveyard for Democratic
presidential aspirations in recent years, could be the key to
victory for Michael Dukakis this fall, according to surveys
conducted for the Times Mirror Co. by The Gallup Organization.
   Dukakis is currently enjoying a wide lead over Vice President
George Bush across most of the nation, but the American mood is so
divided that it could be a close election come November, said the
head of the Gallup organization.
   ``The numbers have been pretty wide, but the potential to narrow
is very great,'' said Andrew Kohut of Dukakis' lead.
   But, he added, the outlook of westerners appears to have changed.
   For example, ``traditionally anti-government voters in the Rocky
Mountains are now calling for more government action on social
issues than is the average American voter. They are most strongly
in favor of free health care for the needy, national health
insurance and help for the homeless,'' his report said.
   The West holds 111 of the 270 electoral votes needed to elect a
president, votes that have gone mostly to Republicans in recent
years.
   Western voters, while optimistic about their own financial
future, are dissatisfied with the general course of the nation and
they have not found in Bush the anti-establishment leader they once
saw in Ronald Reagan, he wrote.
   In national polls taken shortly after his nomination on July 20,
Dukakis led Bush 54 percent to 39 percent, Kohut said in releasing
the new analysis of the election prospects prepared for the Times
Mirror Co.
   While the attention generated by the upcoming Republican
national convention should help Bush narrow the gap, Kohut said he
expects Dukakis to retain a lead at least through the first debate
between the two men, which will likely set the tone for the balance
of the campaign.
   ``It's likely to be a close election. It's an uncertain
electorate, one that is divided in mood,'' explained Kohut. ``On
the one hand there is short run economic optimism, but that is
balanced in various ways with dissatisfaction with the state of the
nation.''
   ``It's a balancing act for both of them,'' he said, of Bush and
Dukakis.
   ``People clearly don't want radical change. They want some
change, but they are not sure what that change is,'' Kohut said.
   The Iran-Contra scandal has proven a major factor, Kohut said,
seriously damaging the confidence of many supporters of President
Reagan's administration.
   That has been a particular problem in the Rocky Mountain states,
said Kohut. That region was a bastion of support for Reagan and
many people there saw selling arms to Iran as betrayal and are
``really angry.''
   Dukakis led Bush 49 percent to 39 percent in the West in surveys
taken in late June and early July, according to Kohut. The results
reflected Bush's problem of being associated with the Iran-Contra
scandal, but being unable to benefit from economic improvement
because that area has not done as well as other regions, he said.
   In May, Dukakis led 51 percent to 39 percent in the Rockies and
51 percent to 40 percent in the Pacific States.
   Kohut said the regional analyses he released were developed from
8,500 detailed interviews taken between May and July. The margin of
error for a survey of that size is just under 2 percentage points
either way.
   ``I don't think that either candidate can take for granted ...
any state,'' commented Kohut. All of the big states are close
``except maybe New York,'' he said. He showed the Massachusetts
governor leading in the Empire State.
   Dukakis can be expected to do well in the East, he said. Kohut
noted that the East is Dukakis' home area, and he said Easterners
tend to have a stronger interest in an activist government, meaning
they are more likely to lean toward a Democrat. The Eastern states
offer 135 electoral votes, Kohut said.
   His June-July polls showed Dukakis leading 49 percent to 41
percent in the East. A separate study taken earlier gave Dukakis a
54 percent to 34 percent lead in New England and 55 percent to 36
percent in the Middle Atlantic states.
   Dukakis' lead in the East is ``significant, if soft'' says
Kohut. The region is more likely to disapprove of the Reagan
administration and more willing to endorse an activist social
agenda, he said.
   In the Midwest, with 137 electoral votes, Bush faces a problem
with voters the pollster termed ``the disaffected.''
   These people supported Reagan because he campaigned against
government as an outsider, but many are turning toward the
Democratic Party.
   In the nation's center, Dukakis leads Bush 47 percent to 37
percent in the June-July polling, the report said. In May that lead
had been 52 percent to 39 percent in the east central states and 52
percent to 36 percent in the west central.
   Dukakis Midwestern lead is bolstered by economic discontent,
Kohut concluded. ``Still, Dukakis' edge there is `soft' and is as
likely to be fueled by anti-Bush sentiment as by positive support
for the Democratic nominee.''
   Only in the more conservative South, with 155 electoral votes,
does Bush hold a lead, topping Dukakis 47 percent to 40 percent,
according to the June-July survey. Dukakis had held a narrow
three-point lead in the Southeast in M

   Fans of three knuckleheads famed for
bopping each other on the head, throwing pies and chortling
``n'yuk, n'yuk, n'yuk'' are writing letters and circulating
petitions to get the government's attention.
   The Three Stooges, they insist, deserve to be honored on a U.S.
postage stamp.
   ``They were the longest-running comedy team in the history of
motion pictures. Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and the Marx
Brothers pale in significance compared with the Stooges,'' said
Jeff Lenberg, a Southern California writer and Stooge historian.
   Lenberg and other admirers of Moe, Larry and Curly _ not to
forget Shemp, Joe and Curly-Joe _ say the Stooges are part of
modern American culture.
   ``My father always said their comedy was based on the upsetting
of dignity. And I thought of George Washington getting his wig
knocked off. That's what the Stooges would have done to him,'' said
Joan Howard Maurer.
   Maurer, daughter of Moe Howard _ the one with the trademark
bangs and scowl _ launched the stamp campaign last year in her
fifth book on the Stooges.
   After all, W.C. Fields was honored with a stamp in 1980, and
recently the postmaster general said Laurel and Hardy could appear
on a stamp.
   But Stooge afficionados point out that while Fields and Laurel
and Hardy are seldom seen nowadays, the Stooges _ who began with
vaudeville and reached their height in film _ are still seen on
television all over the world.
   ``If you stopped people on the street and showed them a picture
of the Three Stooges, they'd know them right away,'' said Gary
Lassin, president of the Three Stooges Fan Club, with about 2,000
members worldwide.
   Stephanie Salter, a San Francisco Examiner columnist, is
relaying hundreds of pro-Stooge letters to the Postal Service's
Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee.
   ``I just think that it's the fact the world is getting heavier
every day. I just can't emphasize the importance of silliness,''
Salter said.
   The silliness as most people know it began in 1934, when Moe,
brother Curly and a violin player with a receding mop named Larry
Fine made ``Women Haters,'' their first short for Columbia.
   ``The whole concept was that Moe was the brains of the outfit,
supported by Larry the middleman, who was supposed to be a little
less smart than Moe but more intelligent than Curly,'' Lenberg said.
   ``But Moe always came out as not so smart after all. He was as
much a stooge as Curly or Larry,'' he said.
   Curly, the one with the shaved head and high-pitched
``EEE-bee-bee-bee,'' was sidelined by a stroke in 1946 and replaced
by Shemp Howard. Shemp died in 1955 and was replaced first by Joe
Besser, who stayed with the group for three years, and finally by
Joe DeRita, who resembled the original Curly and was known as
Curly-Joe.
   The group kept working until 1970. Moe and Larry died in 1975,
Besser died within the past year, and DeRita, now 79, lives in
North Hollywood, Lenberg said.
   While some dislike the violence of the Stooges' routines, fans
describe the group as a living cartoon.
   ``It smacks of Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner,'' Maurer said.
``Most children, unless they really have a behavior problem, know
this is not real. You see Curly getting hit with an anvil, but he
just scratches his head and says `OO-ooh!'''
   ``They got away with things everyone wants to get away with but
can't. Wouldn't you like to kick your boss in the rear or throw a
pie in a society matron's face?'' Lassin said.
   But how much chance does the stamp campaign have?
   Many of the 2,000 requests the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee
receives a month are for Elvis Presley, John Wayne or Marilyn
Monroe, said Dick Rustin, manager of stamp information for the
Postal Service. So far only a few have come from Stooge fans, he
said.
   And even if lovers of the Stooges flood the committee with
letters, the selection process can take several years, Rustin said.
   ``But we choose to believe it can't hurt,'' Lassin said.

   Students and professors boycotted
classes at the Catholic University on Thursday to protest the
expulsion of a Jesuit priest by the government of President Alfredo
Stroessner.
   Authorities said the boycott at the university, the nation's
second-largest with 8,000 students enrolled in Asuncion and four
branches, protested the expulsion of the Rev. Juan Antonio de la
Vega.
   De la Vega, 65, who taught canon law at the university, was
arrested and expelled to neighboring Argentina on July 25.
   The government accused him advocating its violent overthrow. The
church denied the charges.
   Church sources said a ``march of silence'' by priests and the
laity was being organized for Saturday in Asuncion as a further
protest.
   In a message read at all Masses on Sunday, the church charged it
was being persecuted and called on the government to ``respect the
fundamental rights of human dignity.''

   U.S. businesses' efficiency in producing goods
and services decreased in the second quarter, its first decline
since 1986, the Labor Department said today.
   Preliminary data show productivity among non-farm businesses,
responsible for three-fourths of the nation's economic activity,
falling 1.7 percent from April through June compared with the first
three months of the year, the department said.
   Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent from
January through March.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater commented, ``The second
quarter decline in productivity should be a temporary blip related
to the drought. So it shows the economy is still strong.''
   Reflecting the continuing strong economic expansion, output of
goods and services by non-farm businesses rose at an annual rate of
4.7 percent in the second quarter.
   To achieve that, workers put in 6.5 percent more hours, the
largest quarterly increase since 1984 and a reflection of the
14-year low in the nation's unemployment rate.
   Meanwhile, labor costs soared 5.9 percent, the largest gain
since a 6.1 percent increase in the last quarter of 1986, as hourly
wages and benefits rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the
second quarter.
   After taking into consideration a 4.4 percent annual rate of
inflation over the last 18 months, however, workers' purchasing
power actually declined 0.6 percent from April through June, the
department said.
   While businesses as a whole suffered from poorer efficiency in
the second quarter, manufacturers, responsible for a fourth of the
nation's economic output, continued to show improved productivity,
up 3.5 percent from the first quarter.
   Reflecting an ongoing boom in the industrial sector spawned by
record exports, manufacturing output soared 5.4 percent in the
second quarter with only a 1.8 percent increase in the number of
hours worked.
   Manufacturers also were much more successful in holding down
factory wage and benefit increases, allowing annual raises of only
2.9 percent from April through June.
   That enabled employers to actually reduce the labor costs
associated with each item coming off their assembly lines by 0.6
percent, even though it meant their workers took a 1.8 percent cut
in their purchasing power, the government said.

   NASA computers aborted the
test-firing of space shuttle Discovery's engines a fraction of a
second before ignition today after reporting a valve problem,
marking another disappointment for the space program.
   Engineers hoped to ready the shuttle for another attempt on
Sunday, but one official said the delay could be as much as a week.
The delay threatened to push back further the first post-Challenger
launch, planned for late September.
   It was the fifth such postponement in two weeks. The test is
considered crucial for qualifying Discovery for the first shuttle
flight since the Challenger explosion 2{ years ago.
   ``That's why we have flight readiness firings, to work the bugs
out of equipment before we launch,'' said NASA administrator James
Fletcher.
   Discovery's three main engines, generating total thrust of 1.1
million pounds, were to fire for 20 seconds in a test of the entire
shuttle system. Steel bolts were to hold the spaceship firmly on
the pad during the firing.
   The engines were to have begun firing six seconds before the
zero mark. The shutdown came just after the ``go'' for starting the
engines was issued but before ignition actually began, launch
control center commentator Hugh Harris said.
   Harris said the shuttle's master computer ``did not see that the
engine bleed valve had fully closed'' and automatically sent a
shutdown signal.
   Engineers were trying to determine if there was a faulty valve
or if the sensor had given an incorrect reading, he said. The bleed
valve vents excess gases.
   If the engines had fired with the valve open, excess pressure
might have built up in the fuel line and caused a rupture that
could had led to an explosion, said Joseph Lombardo, the main
engine program manager.
   If the problem is with the valve or a sensor, Discovery's flow
director, John Talone, said the delay could be between three and
seven days while the faulty equipment is replaced.
   If the problem can be corrected by simply changing computer
software, Talone said, the turnaround time could be cut to three
days.
   Immediately after the shutdown, the launch team remotely began
to make the vehicle safe as it sat on the pad, its 154-foot-tall
tank loaded with 385,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and 143,000
gallons of liquid oxygen, Harris said.
   He said the propellants would be drained from the tank, and the
igniters in each engine would have to be replaced before another
attempt.
   Engine No. 2, where the problem occurred, is one of two brand
new engines on Discovery. Engine No. 1 has been flown on three
shuttle missions.
   Program managers have been grooming Discovery for the first
shuttle flight since the loss of Challenger and its crew of seven
in an explosion 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Even before today many officials believed the launch would slip
into October because of earlier delays in the test and an
unresolved gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate
from the main engines.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said Wednesday that a one-day delay in
the firing test would move back the launch one day.
   Among the disappointed observers today were two of the five
astronauts slated to fly Discovery on the first post-Challenger
mission, Navy Capt. Rick Hauck and Marine Lt. Col. Dave Hilmers.
   Soon after the test firing, shuttle managers expect to give the
go-ahead to a plan for engineers to cut a hole through the rear
wall of Discovery's cargo bay in an effort to reach and repair a
nitrogen tetroxide leak.
   The shuttle program also must pass another key propulsion test
before Discovery can be certified for flight: a full-scale firing,
the fifth in a series, of the redesigned solid fuel booster rocket
at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah. It is scheduled about Aug. 20.
   The Challenger explosion was blamed on a faulty booster rocket
joint that allowed flame to escape and ignite the external fuel
tank.

   Vietnam's foreign minister today said
his country will no longer help account for missing U.S. servicemen
or cooperate on other humanitarian issues until Washington ends its
``hostile policy against my government.''
   Vietnam announced Wednesday that it has temporarily halted plans
for joint efforts to account for missing Americans and for
resettling former political prisoners in the United States.
   Agreements on the issues had been reached last month.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
are very concerned, because we thought we were making some progress
at getting the investigations going about MIA's and POW's.''
   ``Our position has always been clear,'' Fitzwater said. ``I
guess we're a little surprised and not quite sure what Vietnam is
up to here.''
   The Vietnam News Agency said Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach
wrote a letter dated Sunday to Gen. John W. Vessey, a special U.S.
presidential emissary, saying the decision to halt cooperation was
in response to recent congressional testimony by Assistant
Secretary of State Gaston Sigur.
   Sigur on July 28 argued against a congressional resolution
urging the establishment of ``interest sections'' _ diplomatic
missions below the level of embassies _ in Hanoi and Washington,
saying they would not improve cooperation on humanitarian issues.
   He called for continued U.S. isolation of Vietnam until it ends
it decade-old military occupation of Cambodia.
   Thach spoke with reporters in Bangkok today after holding talks
on Cambodia with Thailand's Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila.
   Asked how long Vietnam was suspending cooperation on U.S.
humanitarian issues, he replied: ``I would like to ask Gen. Vessey
this question, how long they will continue such hostile policy
against my government?''
   He said it was not a question of the United States apologizing,
but rather ``a question of hostile policy against my country, to
stop it.''
   Thach and Vessey reached an agreement in August 1987 under which
Vietnam pledged to accelerate its accounting of nearly 1,800
Americans listing as missing in action in the Vietnam war. The
United States pledged to help Vietnam with its humanitarian
problems.
   Thach told Vessey last month that Vietnam will try to resolve 70
top priority MIA cases by the end of the year and welcomed joint
excavations for remains from August to October.
   There have no such excavations since the first one in late 1985.
   Technical experts of the two sides met in Hanoi last week to
work out arrangements and U.S. officials said they anticipated
joint surveys and investigations that would begin soon.
   The two countries held talks in Hanoi last month on America's
offer to resettle former U.S. government employees and officials of
the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government who were put into
``re-education camps'' after the 1975 North Vietnamese victory.
   A joint communique said Vietnam was allowing them to emigrate as
the United States gave assurances it would not encourage them to
conduct anti-Vietnamese activities.
   But the official Vietnamese media later blamed the U.S. for lack
of progress, saying the biggest obstacle was the U.S. refusal to
set up a ``working group'' to organize the emigration of about
500,000 of the former inmates and their relatives.

<TEXT>
   The United States has paid $25 million of what it
owes to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization to show it is
encouraged by the agency's progress in budgetary reform, a diplomat
said Thursday.
   FAO spokesman Richard Lydiker confirmed the United States made
the payment last week, saying the payment came in the wake of a
compromise agreement on the budgetary process.
   The diplomat said the compromise suggested to the U.S.
government that ``FAO was making progress toward reforms'' sought
by the United States and other nations. He also said the U.S.
government was ``pleased and encouraged by the favorable
developments and therefore decided to release the funds.''
   The United States had withheld payments of its assessments,
which amount to a quarter of the agency's budget, in an effort to
force the organization to make budgetary reforms.
   The Rome-based organization coordinates agricultural projects in
developing countries and is the largest specialized agency in the
United Nations.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition that he not be identified
by name or country, said United States made the payment July 27 in
Washington and that it will be applied to the arrears of $67.4
million for 1986 and 1987.
   The United States also has not paid its 1988 assessment of $60.7
million and $3.9 million for its share of the working capital and
special reserve accounts.
   The diplomat said the United States has expressed its intention
to pay its arrears and meet its assessment, but that the timing has
not been determined.
   ``Future payments will depend on continued progress by the
organization in pursuing the reforms,'' he said.

   Hong Kong and Hanoi have not reached any
solutions on repatriating Vietnamese refugees, but they agreed to
meet again soon, a government statement said Thursday.
   The statement said meetings this week between the two
governments regarding repatriating Vietnamese boat people were
``open and friendly.''
   Both sides agreed the historical and social causes of the
outflow were complex but ``realistic and effective measures to
bring it to an end were urgently required,'' the statement said. It
did not elaborate on when future meetings might be held.
   Earlier Thursday, Vietnamese foreign minister Nguyen Co Thach
told reporters after talks with the Thai government that Vietnam
will take back all people who wish to return home after fleeing by
boat.
   On June 16, Hong Kong started to curb surging arrivals of
Vietnamese boat people by ending its open-door policy. Vietnamese
who cannot prove they are fleeing political persecution are
considered illegal immigrants subject to repatriation.
   About 7,000 Vietnamese have sailed into Hong Kong since the
policy came into effect and the number of Vietnamese staying in
Hong Kong camps is approaching 23,000.

   An agricultural official on
Thursday warned that swarms of locusts in northern Ethiopia will
breed fast because of recent rains and may invade the central part
of the country.
   Hailu Kassa, head of crop protection and control department in
the Ministry of Agriculture, said the Desert Locust Control
Organization of East Africa has provided 100,000 tons of
insecticide, spraying equipment, trucks and a plane to fight the
pests in Tigray and Eritrea provinces.
   The government will provide two more planes. It asked the United
Nations Food and Agricultural Organization for more insecticide.
   The desert locust control organization said five huge swarms
were seen flying near Asmara, capital of Eritrea, on July 21-24.
Some of the swarms contained more than 50 million locusts each and
were capable of eating more than 100 tons of green vegetation in
one day.
   Kassa said the locusts had been blown across the Red Sea from
Saudi Arabia by a hurricane. They invaded Tigray and Eritrea after
farmers started planting crops following a severe drought that
threatened millions with starvation.
   Four years ago, drought and famine in the region killed an
estimated 1 million people and spurred the biggest international
relief operation in history.

   Final checkout work has begun on the Air
Force's first Stealth bomber and the aircraft will be displayed for
the first time during a ``roll-out'' ceremony in mid-November, the
service announced today.
   The Air Force also said that the new bomber, designated the B-2,
will be powered by four General Electric Co. jet engines; will be
an unusually short plane because of its unique design, and will be
flown by a crew of two, reflecting the technology that has gone
into its development.
   The B-52 bomber requires a crew of six and the new B-1B bomber
is flown by a crew of four.
   Today's statement on the Stealth bomber marked the second step
in a process begun last April, when the Air Force finally began to
lift a decade-long veil of secrecy by releasing an artist's sketch
of the plane.
   Officials said then that they anticipated the first flight of
the plane would occur this fall and that additional details,
including a new estimate of cost overruns, would be revealed this
summer.
   The Air Force said today it was not yet prepared to release the
new cost estimates. But it said it still anticipated the bomber
would make its first flight this fall, despite the fact the first
plane won't be rolled out from its production plant until
mid-November.
   The first B-2 won't fly on that day of its public unveiling, but
preparations for that next milestone will be very close to
completion by then, the service said.
   ``The B-2 will roll out in mid-November at Air Force Plant 42 in
Palmdale, Calif. Additionally, the contractor is currently well
into the assembly phase of aircraft No. 2,'' a statement said.
   The Northrop Corp. is the prime contractor for the plane.
   The Stealth bomber takes its nickname from the fact it is
designed to fly without showing up on radar.
   It resembles a ``flying wing'' in shape, without a conventional
fuselage in the center. A small cockpit bubble rises on top of the
flying wing and inlets for the jet engines are placed to each side
of the cockpit, also on top of the wing.
   The design allows the aircraft to be fabricated without any
sharp angles. According to Pentagon sources, the plane also relies
on the use of radar-absorbing coatings on its exterior surfaces and
composite materials for construction.
   Today, the Air Force released the plane's dimensions for the
first time, disclosing it was only slightly longer than an F-15 jet
fighter but had a wingspan approaching that of a B-52 bomber. The
B-2 will stand about 17 feet high, 69 feet long and have a wingspan
of about 172 feet, the service said.

   Floods caused by monsoon rains have
swept through three provinces of Pakistan, killing 158 people and
causing extensive damage to property and crops, the minister of
justice said Thursday.
   The disaster began three weeks ago in the provinces of Punjab,
Sind and the North West Frontier, said the minister, Wasim Sajjad.
Most of the victims drowned or were crushed when their houses
collapsed, he said.
   Twenty-four of the victims died Wednesday, including 11 from one
family, when floods and lightning destroyed several homes in
Chugarazai, a village 100 100 miles northwest of Islamabad,
officials said earlier.
   Sajjad said more than 1 million people have been affected by the
floods and by rains nationwide and that 2.67 million acres of land
have been inundated. He said more than 60,000 acres of crops have
been destroyed.
   More than 100,000 people have been moved into temporary
government camps, he said, and the flooding has destroyed 19,000
homes and damaged 31,000.
   Sajjad released the figures in a report to the Senate, where
some lawmakers said the government had failed to take adequate
action to protect people from monsoon rains and flooding in three
rivers: the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum.
   In addition to the seasonal monsoon rains, Pakistan has received
50 percent rain this summer than during the same time last year.
   The death toll and damage to property and crops will continue to
rise as the floods and heavy rains continue in northern Pakistan,
he said.

   Police have arrested four more people in the
17-month kidnapping of an 8-year-old boy, authorities said Thursday.
   The arrests bring to eight the number of people held in the
abduction of Marco Fiora, who was freed Tuesday in the mountains of
southern Calabria.
   All eight had been arrested before the boy was released, but
news of the new arrests was withheld. They were accused of
complicity in the kidnapping.
   Police said the kidnapping was believed to have been carried out
by members of the `Ndrangheta, the Calabrian version of the Mafia.
   Marco was kidnapped on March 2, 1987, by a gang of masked and
armed bandits as his parents were driving him to school.
   The kidnappers demanded a ransom of about $4 million. Marco's
parents, who run a garage and bakery, said they were unable to pay
such a high ransom.
   Police said the family paid only about $220,000. The gang is
believed to have released the boy out of fear police were closing
in.
   ``It (the abduction) was a mistake,'' said Aldo Faraoni, chief
of Turin's detective squad, adding that the family could never have
met the ransom demanded by the kidnappers.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes to Seize Developer's Land Near Civil War
Battlefield</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill authorizing the federal government to
seize more than 500 acres of a developer's land adjacent to a
historic Civil War battlefield was cleared Thursday for House floor
action, possibly next week.
   The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved by
voice vote an almost identical measure to one passed earlier by the
House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee.
   The Public Works version, however, stipulated that $30 million
in Interior Department rather than Transportation Department funds
be used to study whether roads should be closed in the Manassas
National Battlefield Park in the Virginia countryside west of
Washington.
   Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., an early sponsor of the bill, said
the House may vote on the measure Aug. 10.
   The bill would allow the government to seize 542 acres adjacent
to the park where a developer has proposed a massive shopping
complex, add the tract to the 4,600-acre park, close two roads
running through the battlefield and build new roads around the park.
   Congress became involved in the dispute when Northern Virginia
developer John T. Hazel announced plans to build 1.2 million square
feet of retail space, 1.7 million square feet of office space and
560 homes next to the site of two major Civil War battles.
   Hazel's first proposal for a modest office park development
raised no community concerns, but when Prince William County, Va.,
officials relaxed zoning laws for the parcel, Hazel expanded his
development plans.
   Historians and preservationists complain that the development
site includes a bluff from which Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
commanded Southern troops in the Second Battle of Manassas.
   The tract also was the site of two field hospitals, they say.
Most historians believe that the remains of Union and Confederate
dead lie in unmarked graves on the site.
   The First Battle of Manassas, fought in July 1861, was the first
significant land battle of the Civil War. A surprising Confederate
victory there convinced Union authorities that the war would be a
protracted affair.
   More than 20,000 casualties were suffered by both sides in the
Second Battle of Manassas, which lasted over three days in August
1862. Most historians agree that Lee's triumph in that battle
represented the Confederacy's greatest victory of the war.

<HEAD>US Ambassador Calls Iran's attack on a Norwegian tanker
reprehensible</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, today called Iran's attack on a Norwegian tanker
reprehensible, but attributed it to ``excessive zeal'' by a local
commander.
   Walters said Iran and Iraq clearly had decided to end their war
in the Persian Gulf and that it would take some time for fighting
to taper off because of `'pent-up hostility'' on the two sides.
   ``After an eight-year war,'' Walters said, ``I don't consider
two weeks an excessive time'' to work out cease-fire terms.
   The U.S. diplomat recalled the protracted negotiations that were
required to end the wars in Korea and Vietnam.
   Iranian gunboats fired at the Norwegian tanker after it had
refused to stop for inspection, shipping executives in the gulf
said. The captain said a few bullets pierced the ship but caused no
injuries.
   Walters, appearing on a U.S.-sponsored telecast to the area,
said ``any attack on neutral shipping is to be reprehended. It is
wrong.''
   He said he was ``quite surprised'' by the attack, and added:
``Attacks on neutral shipping by belligerents are not justifiable
by any circumstances.''
   And yet, Walter said, ``I think this was a case of excessive
zeal by a local commander. I think both countries have maintained
that their national choice is for peace.''
   ``What we are witnessing is some of the bitterness and some of
the hostility of eight years of war manifesting itself.'' Walters
said. ``But in my view the two countries have made the choice for
peace.''
   For the second time this week, the U.S. ambassador supported
Iraq's demand for face-to-face negotiations with Iran.
   ``I don't believe it is possible for two countries to make peace
without face-to-face discussions,'' he said. ``I have never heard
of a peace being achieved entirely through third parties.''
   His statement raised questions about U.S. policy on the issue.
   Phyllis Oakley, the State Department spokeswoman, renewed the
U.S. call for swift implementation of the cease-fire without
``conditions that only prolong'' the delay.
   The United Nations Security Council's cease-fire resolution does
prescribe direct negotiations between the two sides.
   ``But,'' Watlers said, ``it is perfectly obvious that
face-to-face talks must take place between the two parties who have
been at war.''
   On another subject, the U.S. ambassador called for participation
by ``some sort of Palestinian delegation'' in Arab-Israeli peace.
   But a State Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Walters' remarks did not mean a change in U.S.
policy.
   The Reagan administration has called for Palestinian
participation, but not in a separate delegation. The plan forwarded
by Secretary of State George P. Shultz calls for Palestinians to
participate in a joint delegation with Jordan.
   Walters stressed that Jordan must take part in any negotiations
in view of its border with Israel.
   On Sunday, King Hussein announced he was severing legal and
administrative links to the West Bank and surrendering the areas'
future to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The territory, with a predominantly Palestinian Arab population,
was held by Jordan from 1948 until 1967 and by Israel since then.

   A truck filled with explosives blew
up today at a crowded bazaar in the Afghan capital of Kabul,
killing four people and injuring 18, Radio Kabul reported.
   The blast occurred shortly before Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze arrived in Kabul for what was described a ``working
visit.''
   Afghanistan's Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, blamed the
explosion on guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed government.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a report from Kabul, said the
explosion occurred in the Shahrara area of the city. It blamed the
bomb on the ``irreconcilable opposition,'' or Afghan guerrillas.
   The blast occurred a day after Shevardnadze accused Pakistan of
``international terrorism'' for its support of the Afghan rebels.
   The Soviet Union accuses Pakistan of sending massive amounts of
arms to the rebels in violation of an April 14 agreement reached in
Geneva.
   As part of the agreement, the Soviet Union is withdrawing its
more than 100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan. The Soviets entered
Afghanistan in December 1979 to back the government in its war with
the guerrillas.
   Bombings and rocket attacks on Kabul have become increasingly
frequent as the Soviet soldiers withdraw and the Afghan government
forces take on the burden of the fighting.

<HEAD>Premier Defends Government in Secret Palme Murder Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson in
testimony Thursday defended the government's role in a secret and
partially illegal private investigation into the 1986 murder of his
predecessor, Olof Palme.
   Carlsson, speaking to a parliamentary inquiry into the
politically explosive affair, shifted responsibility for misconduct
in the investigation to national police chief Nils-Erik Ahmansson.
   But he said he supported the investigation in principle because
it was checking allegations that the security police had failed to
act on a tip received shortly before Palme was shot.
   Palme, prime minister for 13 years, was assassinated Feb. 28,
1986, while walking unguarded in downtown Stockholm. Official
investigations failed to produce a motive or lead to the
prosecution of any suspect, despite a reward of about $8 million.
   Carlsson's testimony ended a week of nationally televised
hearings in the affair, which has become a major issue for the
Sept. 18 general election. The Constitution Committee was to report
on the extent of the government's involvement and whether it broke
the law.
   Critics accused the ruling Social Democrats of exceeding their
authority and sidestepping official investigators. On June 7,
Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon was forced to quit because of
her role.
   The secret inquiry was conducted by Ebbe Carlsson, a publisher
linked to the inner circle of the Social Democratic party. He is
not related to the prime minister.
   Ahmansson was under pressure to resign after allegations that he
tacitly approved the use of outlawed surveillance devices. A former
policeman has been indicted for smuggling the equipment.
   The publisher testified earlier that he believed Palme was
killed by members of the Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, possibly
acting on orders from Iran, after Palme threatened to stop the sale
of Swedish weapons to Teheran.
   The Kurdish theory had been discarded by prosecutors in charge
of the case after a year-long investigation.
   Prime Minister Carlsson said the unconventional private
investigation was justified by the overriding importance of
uncovering clues in the 29-month-old murder.
   ``There were important allegations with serious accusations and
serious criticism against a Swedish authority. My reaction was that
this must immediately be checked out,'' he said.
   Carlsson said he was told of the investigation by Mrs. Leijon,
who only learned about it in about two months after it began in
January.
   In earlier testimony Thursday, Mrs. Leijon said she ``had been
under the impression'' that Ahmansson was in charge of Ebbe
Carlsson's search. Ahmansson has acknowledged Ebbe Carlsson acted
on his orders, but he has denied approving any wrongdoing.
   Mrs. Leijon's line of defense appeared aimed at clearing the
Social Democratic party from charges that it acceded to an illegal
operation.
   She quit after disclosures that she wrote a letter of
introduction for Ebbe Carlsson to British intelligence authorities.
Copies were kept secret in her private safe in defiance of required
procedure.
   In her letter written in May, Mrs. Leijon said Ebbe Carlsson was
working ``on my behalf.'' Replying to critics who said the letter
proved her responsibility, Mrs. Leijon said it was ``carelessly
worded'' and it was not meant to imply that she was in charge of
the investigation by Carlsson's team.
   That prompted Center Party committee member Bertil Fiskesjo to
say that ``everybody seems eager to say that Ebbe Carlsson did not
act on assignment, sometimes I ask myself if he exists at all.''

   The Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, arrived in Afghanistan today on a previously
unannounced visit that followed a sharp meeting with a top
Pakistani official.
   Shevardnadze's arrival in the Afghan capital, Kabul, was
announced by the official Tass news agency in Moscow. Radio Kabul
reported that a truck loaded with explosives blew up in Kabul
shortly before his arrival, killing four people and injuring 18.
   It blamed the explosion on guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed government.
   Shevardnandze's visit came a day after he met with Pakistan's
foreign minister, Yaqub Khan, in Moscow. During that meeting,
Shevardnadze accused Pakistan of ``international terrorism'' for
its support of the Afghan guerrillas.
   Tass said in a two-sentence report that Shevardnadze was met at
the Kabul airport by Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil and other
officials.
   It said nothing about the nature of Shevardnadze's mission
except to say that it was a ``working visit.''
   The Soviet Union is withdrawing its more than 100,000 soldiers
from Afghanistan under terms of an April 14 agreement signed in
Geneva by the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United
States.
   The Soviet Union has been increasingly critical of what
Shevardnadze called Pakistan's ``unceasing massive dispatches'' of
arms to the insurgents, and Afghanistan has made scores of
complaints about what it says is Pakistani assistance to the rebels.
   Shevardnadze told Khan that Afghan rebels had recently stepped
up their bombardment of Afghan towns and that hundreds of innocent
people were killed or wounded in the past two months.
   ``Islamabad's support for such actions cannot be described other
than as international terrorism,'' he told the Pakistani official.
   He said the Soviet Union and Afghanistan would find ways to
counter Pakistan's alleged interference, but did not specify them.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back the
government in its war with guerrillas.

   Ethiopia said Thursday its forces
have captured a strategic rebel stronghold in the mountainous
northwestern Tigray province after ``fierce engagements.''
   ``The area was a strong fortress of the bandits who had also
consolidated their positions in strategic positions in the
surrounding areas,'' the state-owned Ethiopian News Agency reported.
   The term ``bandit'' is used by the government to describe rebels
of the Tigray People's Liberation Front and the seccessionist
Eritrean People's Liberation Front, also fighting the government in
Ethiopia's northermost province of Eritrea.
   Thhe agency did not say when or where the battle took place or
mention casualties on either side.
   The agency said 500 technicians from 91 public and private
organizations were being sent to Tigray and Eritrea where troops
are engaged in ``in a bitter struggle against the bandits to defend
the unity and territorial integrity of the country.''
   Hailu Yimenu, deputy prime minister and chairman of the
government's War Logistics Committee, told the technicians
maintenance of vehicles and other equipment was decisive in
defeating the rebels.
   Rebels of both groups early this year won major battles,
capturing several towns. The government launched a counteroffensive
in May and two months later reported it had recaptured most of the
towns.
   There is no way to independently confirm rebel or government
claims about the war which has been going on for 14 years in Tigray
and 27 in Eritrea, Africa's longest civil war.

   Raising levels of so-called ``good cholesterol''
and lowering levels of ``bad cholesterol'' in men with elevated
cholesterol levels lowered their risk of coronary heart disease,
says a study released Thursday.
   The findings followed up a five-year experiment by the Helsinki
Heart Study in which a drug called gemfibrozil was used to raise
the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the ``good
cholesterol,'' and lower damaging low-density cholesterol (LDL) in
a group of 2,051 men 40 to 45 years old with elevated levels of
cholesterol other than HDL.
   The initial report of the experiment, published in November,
showed the group who took the drug suffered 34 percent fewer heart
attacks than 2,030 other men who were given placebos over the same
period.
   The follow-up study emphasizes the role of HDL in lowering heart
disease risks, and will change the way doctors measure cholesterol
levels, said Dr. Vesa Maaninen of Helsinki University.
   ``There was a two-four percent drop in numbers of cardiac
arrests with every one percent increase in HDL cholesterol,'' said
Maaninen.
   Many studies have shown previously that there is a statistical
link between high levels of HDL, low levels of LDL and a reduced
likelihood of coronary heart disease, in which waxy build-ups in
the coronary arteries slow and ultimately prevent the flow of blood
to the heart muscle.
   Barry Lewis, a British pathologist at London's St. Thomas'
Hospital, said that on average, nearly two-thirds of people in
industrialized nations have high LDL cholesterol.
   He said that while most people can lower LDL cholesterol levels
and raise HDL levels with a change of diet, some have persistently
high levels and would benefit most from medication.
   Maaninen came to London to report these latest findings, being
published this week in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   Maaninen said the drug produced little difference in the rate of
cardiac arrests in the first two years, but that after that the
rate decreased the longer the men took the drug.
   Marshall Molloy, a spokesman for the manufacturers,
Warner-Lambert Co., said gemfibrozil has been approved temporarily
in the United States and awaits final approval from the Food and
Drug Administration.

   A Federal Aviation Administration inspector and

charges they helped military pilots cheat on exams to gain
commercial licenses.
   The ringleaders, reserve Air Force Maj. Charles Chinn, an FAA
safety inspector, and squadron commander Lt. Col. Edward King,
helped 15 to 20 F-16 fighter pilots who took the test at Homestead
Air Force Base, then tried to cover up the cheating during an
investigation, said interim U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   The cheating ``did serious damage to the safety of commercial
aviation,'' Lehtinen said. But he added that few, if any, of the
pilots are working for commercial airlines.
   Most the pilots who took the exam cooperated with investigators
when contacted, Lehtinen said.
   The prosecutor said that no money changed hands but that Chinn
and King apparently hoped to enhance their future careers in
commercial aviation following their retirements from public service.
   He said there were no indications the scandal went beyond Chinn
and Homestead.
   The six men were expected to turn themselves in today.
   Delta Air Lines in Atlanta said that one of the men indicted on
charges of cheating on the tests, reserve Capt. Michael Weininger,
a flight engineer on Boeing 727s for the carrier since June 1987,
was relieved of duty today.
   However, Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate emphasized that Weiningen
had passed a ``rigorous'' Delta training course before flying, and
she added, ``Anybody who didn't know what they were doing would
have been uncovered.''
   The indictment charged that in 1986 and 1987, Chinn and King
supplied test-takers with answers or let other people sit in for
them.
   Others charged were former Air Force officers John Phelps, Paul
Seiler and Kenneth Turano.
   Seiler, Weininger and Turano were accused of cheating on tests
for pilot and flight engineer. Phelps was charged with having
another take the tests for him.
   All six are charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States
in obtaining FAA licenses. Also, all but Turano are charged with
conspiracy to obstruct the subsequent FAA probe. Each count carries
a five-year maximum penalty.

   Peasants demanding
payment for their expropriated land ended a three-day protest that
left one man dead after the government agreed to relocate them and
give them half the money they were owed.
   President Joaquin Balaguer met with representatives of the
farmers Wednesday night in the National Palace and agreed to pay
them $285,000 of the approximately $570,000 they have coming.
   The rest of the money will be paid next month, said an accord
signed by representatives of the government, the peasants and the
Roman Catholic Church, which has served as a mediator.
   The government has bought land near the town of Cotui, 80 miles
north of the capital Santo Domingo, to make way for a partially
built dam. Most of the land will be flooded when the project is
finished.
   Balaguer also agreed to try to speed up the relocation of the
124 families forced from their homes by the dam.
   One man died and several people were injured in demonstrations
this week in which protesters detonated homemade bombs and blocked
roads with tree trunks. Dozens were rounded up by police, and many
were reportedly beaten and jailed.
   In February, five people died during a week-long protest by
peasants in the same region demanding payment for their lands and
protesting the contamination of water from byproducts of the
state-owned Rosario gold mine.

   Former Gov. Ray Blanton, blaming an FBI
vendetta for his two years in prison, sought the Democratic
nomination Thursday for one of Tennessee's congressional seats.
   Blanton was one of four Democrats vying for the chance to
succeed retiring Rep. Ed Jones in the 8th District. Jones, a
19-year House veteran, has backed state Rep. John Tanner to run
against the winner of the three-way GOP primary.
   Also running on the Democratic side were Jackson Mayor Bob
Conger and lawyer Ivy Scarbrough. The three Republicans were
businessman Dan Campbell, lawyer Ed Bryant and party activist
Richard Jacobs, who is chairman of the Young Republicans national
federation.
   The other House race is for the 2nd District seat; Rep. John J.
Duncan, a Republican, died June 21. His son, John J. Duncan Jr. of
Knoxville, faced Dr. Robert Proffitt in the GOP primary.
   The Democrats seeking the seat were former state Revenue
Commissioner Dudley W. Taylor, professor of chemical engineering
Robert R. Scott, and political unknown John F. Bowen.
   For the Senate, incumbent Democrat James R. Sasser Jr., seeking
his third six-year term, had no primary opposition. The three GOP
hopefuls vying to challenge him in the Nov. 8 general election were
party activist Alice Algood, lawyer Bill Andersen and lawyer Hubert
Patty.
   In other Democratic primaries, Rep. Marilyn Lloyd of the 3rd
District faced two newcomers _ Lamar Lesley, a quality control
inspector for a transportation company and karate instructor Walter
Ward. Rep. Harold Ford of the 9th District was opposed for the
eighth consecutive time by Memphis businessman Mark Flanagan. No
Republican is running.
   Ford has been indicted in federal court on bank fraud charges,
but no trial date has been set. He said it has not affected his
campaign.
   In the 7th District, businessman Kenneth Bloodworth faced off
against political unknown Francis Tapp for the Democratic
nomination to challenge Republican incumbent Rep. Don Sundquis.

   Blanton, also a former congressman, spent two years in federal
prison after being convicted of conspiracy, extortion and mail
fraud in a public corruption case. The mail fraud counts were
vacated in line with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, and Blanton is
appealing the extortion and conspiracy convictions.
   The ex-governor, who left office in 1979 in a swirl of
controversy over the sale of pardons and liquor licenses, has said
that he expects voters to realize that he was a victim of political
persecution in the FBI investigation.
   ``They know I was railroaded and falsely accused,'' he said.
   Five of the state's nine U.S. representatives had no primary
opposition. Two, Reps. Jim Cooper of the 4th District and Bob
Clement of the 5th, also have no opponents in the Nov. 8 general
election.
   Others without primary opposition were Republican James Quillen,
seeking his 13th two-year term from the 1st District; Democrat Bart
Gordon of the 6th District; and Sundquis.
   Democrat Sidney Smith, a retiree, was unopposed in his bid to
challenge Quillen. Chemical engineer Wallace Embry had no opponents
for GOP nomination to take on Gordon. Hamilton County Commissioner
Harold Coker faced no contest in getting the Republican nomination
for the 3rd District seat now held by Lloyd.

<HEAD>S&G Group Calls for Freezing `Walking Dead' Institutions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A savings and loan trade group called on
federal regulators Thursday to freeze the growth of ``walking
dead'' thrift institutions that are insolvent but still open.
   Charles John Koch, chairman of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, said at a news conference that the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board should bar 444 ``hopelessly insolvent'' S&Ls from making
new loans.
   Koch said the bank board cannot practically close down all
insolvent institutions immediately, but it should take steps now to
ensure that the insolvents do not hurt the profitability of the
rest of the industry.
   He said many insolvent institutions are betting on a decline in
interest rates by pricing their loans at rates slightly under those
offered by profitable institutions and paying slightly higher rates
on deposits, thus forcing the relatively healthy segment of the
industry to narrow its profit margin.
   ``Our point is they're not real people any more. ... They
shouldn't be allowed to compete with solvent institutions,'' he
said. ``... These walking dead are calling into question the
ability of the remaining 85 percent of the industry to survive.''
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, said in an interview
earlier this week that the agency is stepping up its enforcement of
growth limits, originally put on the books in 1985.
   However, Koch complained that 105 of the 444 insolvent thrift
associations were permitted to grow last year, 32 of them faster
than 10 percent.
   Mark Clark, a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the largest S&L trade group, said the league has been
urging the bank board for three years to more strictly police
growth regulations already in force.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, said earlier this week he will introduce a resolution
calling for a freeze on deposit growth of insolvent S&Ls.

   The American Civil Liberties Union sued Thursday
to try to block a new law outlawing pregnancy-for-pay contracts.
   The lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court challenges the
surrogacy law's constitutionality and seeks a hearing on a request
to prevent it from taking effect Sept. 1, said Howard Simon,
executive director of the ACLU's Michigan chapter.
   The law outlaws surrogacy whenever money changes hands and makes
surrogacy brokers subject to five years in prison and $5,000 fines.
   Three infertile couples, who are the surrogate parents to
children conceived under contract, and two surrogate mothers have
agreed to be anonymous plaintiffs ``John and Jane Doe,'' Simon said.
   ``If we lose there is a chance this will be the end of
surrogacy,'' Simon said, predicting that bills like that enacted in
Michigan would be introduced in other states.
   State Sen. Connie Binsfeld, a former Michigan mother of the year
who led the fight to enact Michigan's law, said her goal was to put
Noel Keane of Dearborn, one of the nation's most prolific surrogacy
matchmakers, out of business.
   By Keane's count he has been responsible for 238 surrogate
births since 1978. Forty more surrogate babies are on the way, he
said Wednesday.
   Keane is not a party in the suit.
   ``I want to distance myself from the lawsuit,'' he said. ``I
want the issue to be the right of procreation that's on trial ...
not Noel Keane's entrepreneurship.''
   Keane typically collects $10,000 from a couple he connects with
a woman willing to be artificially inseminated, carry a child to
term and then give up custody. Keane handles the contract and
arranges the inseminations.
   Simon said the lawsuit would challenge the constitutionality of
the law establishing felony penalties for people who enter into
surrogacy agreements.
   ``This is sex discrimination,'' he said, noting the
inconsistency of laws that permit an infertile man to arrange a
pregnancy via a sperm donor but deny the same right to an infertile
woman.
   ``We are dealing with the most fundamental rights that people
have _ rights involving the decision to have children,'' Simon
said. ``There is no justification for the state with its huge hand
to come in and criminalize those decisions.''

   Marisa Bellisario, who rescued the giant Italtel
telecommunications firm from the brink of collapse, died Thursday
of cancer at her home in Turin.
   Ms. Bellisario, who was in her early 50s, was appointed managing
director and chief executive officer of the state-owned Italtel
group in 1981.
   When she took over, losses were piling up by more than $215
million a year. She cut the company's losses in half in 1982 and
then returned it to profitability, where it has remained under her
direction.
   Prior to joining Italtel, Ms. Bellisario was president and chief
executive officer of Olivetti Corporation of America. She joined
the company in 1972 and became director of corporate planning and
then director of the Distributed Data Processing group.
   She became the head of product and operations planning at
General Electric Information Systems Italia in 1965 and kept that
post when the electronics division was acquired by Honeywell
Information Systems Italia in 1969.
   Ms. Bellisario, an economics graduate of Turin University, began
her business career in Olivetti's computer division in 1960.
   Ms. Bellisario, who wrote her own life story in the book ``Woman
and Top Manager,'' frequently worked 12-hour days, but refused to
work weekends in order to spend the time with her husband,
mathematics professor Lionello Cantoni.
   ``Maybe I can show young girls that you can make it and still be
a normal woman, with normal attitudes toward your family or
husband,'' she once said.

<HEAD>Jordan Lays Off, Retires Thousands on West Bank</HEAD>

   Jordan said Thursday it will lay off or
retire the 21,200 Palestinian employees at its institutions in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which effectively turns
over responsibility to the PLO.
   The decision, announced after a Cabinet meeting, was the most
sweeping in practical effect since King Hussein announced Sunday he
was cutting links with the territories, where 1.5 Palestinians live.
   Jordan has paid at least $45 million a year in salaries to its
employees in the West Bank and Gaza. Including expenditures for
hospitals, Islamic institutions, agriculture and education, its
annual outlay has been estimated at $200 million.
   Those working for courts and the authority that controls mosques
and other religious institution are exempt, the announcement said.
   Reaction among Palestinians was mixed.
   ``I don't think it is fair,'' said Jamila Azmi, 55, who has
received a Jordanian salary during 30 years in Bethlehem's school
system. ``Who is going to take care of the fired employees?''
   She said some of those laid off would have to take jobs in
Israel, which leaders of the 8-month-old uprising in the occupied
lands have discouraged.
   Hanna Siniora, a newspaper editor who supports the Palestine
Liberation Organization, praised the move and said: ``Those who
will be hurt can be compensated by the Palestinian side. I assume
that the political vacuum left by Jordan will be filled by the
PLO.''
   Rashad al Shawaa, the deposed mayor of Gaza City and a supporter
of Hussein, said the king's action ``puts the whole responsibility
on the PLO. If the PLO can shoulder it, very good. If not, then the
PLO must go back to Jordan and tell the king: `We need your
cooperation and help.'''
   A senior Jordanian official said privately the government also
is expected to abolish martial law in the West Bank, nominally in
force since the 1967 Middle East war. He said this would ``give the
PLO greater responsibility over West Bank affairs.''
   An end to Jordanian martial law would have comparatively little
effect, since Israel captured the West Bank in the war, but one
result apparently would be dissolution of the 13-member ministerial
committee that supervises Jordan River bridge crossings.
   What impact that would have on movement across the Allenby
bridge, the only open border crossing between Israeli-occupied
territory and hostile Arab states, was not clear immediately .
   The committee also had barred West Bank Palestinians from
dealing with Israel or selling their land to Israeli authorities.
   Jordan radio said the decision to lay off or retire the civil
servants ``is in accordance with the kingdom's decision to cut
legal and administrative links with Palestinians in the occupied
lands. All Jordanian citizens working for official and government
agencies will be retired as of Aug. 16.''
   It said civil servants with less than 15 years of service will
be dismissed with a month's salary for every year of service. A
Jordanian official said 16,000 fell into that category and the PLO
would be responsible for their jobs or welfare.
   Those with more than 15 years and less than 20 will continue
receiving salaries until they retire on pensions at 20 years, the
report said. The official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said 5,200 were were in that group.
   Hussein's latest decision also ends the services of an
unspecified number of workers at private institutions and companies
linked to the government, who will receive severance pay according
to their employers' rules, the radio said.
   On Saturday, the king dissolved the lower house of the Jordanian
parliament, 30 of whose 60 members were Palestinians from the West
Bank. He also has canceled a $1.3 billion development program for
education and economic projects in the West Bank.

<HEAD>US to Press Talks for Greece Air Base Despite Closure Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States intends to press
negotiations for a new lease for a major air base in Greece,
despite a warning from Athens that the base will be closed, a
senior State Department official said Thursday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway told a House
hearing she was surprised by the Greek statement Wednesday that the
Hellenikon base would be shut down. The base is used to monitor
Soviet ship movements in the Mediterranean.
   ``In our view, the subject is still on the table and is not
affected by this announcement,'' she told the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East.
   The most recent round of talks which began in November 1987
regarding the future of four major U.S. air bases in Greece failed
to resolve the question of Hellenikon, she said.
   The ninth round of negotiations on new base leases is scheduled
for Sept. 9. The current five-year agreement expires on Dec. 31.
   Ms. Ridgway said the Greek announcement may have been intended
for internal consumption, or made by someone intent on accelerating
the slow-moving negotiations.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou is a Socialist who came to power in
1981 vowing to close American bases on Greek soil. He has since
relented but is under constant pressure from leftist groups to win
U.S. political and economic concessions in exchange for lease
renewals.
   Hellenikon, with its high-profile location near the Athens
airport, has been the site of anti-American demonstrations.
   At the hearing, Ms. Ridgway defended the Reagan administration's
decision to sell Greece 500 shoulder-fired anti-aircraft Stinger
missiles. She said Greece was a vital member of NATO and a loyal
U.S. ally.
   Rep. Donald E. Lukens, R-Ohio, said he was angered by
Papandreou's anti-American positions.
   ``I am fed up with the behavior of this man who can't even
fulfill his obligations to his wife, never mind to NATO,'' Lukens
said. The Greek premier is reported to have had marital problems
with his American-born wife.
   Rep. Lawrence Smith, D-Fla., criticized the Stinger sales in
light of several recent terrorist attacks in Greece, including the
slaying of a U.S. military attache and a bloody assault on a cruise
liner.
   Smith noted that the Stingers are coveted by guerrilla groups
because they are portable and easy to use. Ms. Ridgway said the
State Department did not have any evidence that U.S. military
equipment provided to Greece had fallen into terrorists' hands.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill Compensating Japanese-American Internees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE GOULD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed and sent to President Reagan
on Thursday legislation providing apologies and $20,000 tax-free
payments to Japanese-American survivors of World War II internment
camps.
   Reagan has said he will sign the bill, ending ``a sad chapter in
American history in a way that reaffirms America's commitment to
the preservation of liberty and justice for all.''
   Approval came on a 257-156 vote, with supporters saying the
apology would have been an empty one without cash payments.
Opponents argued that America faced a grave threat with the
outbreak of war and that mistakes were made and many other lives
disrupted.
   About 60,000 people are eligible for the lump-sum payments, but
the government will have 10 years to make all the payments
totalling $1.25 billion. The elderly will be iven priority, but the
first people likely won't be paid until January 1990. Anybody
living at the time the bill is signed qualifies, and only their
immediate family can collect if they die before payment. No
payments will be made to the families of those who have died before
the bill is signed.
   More than 120,000 Japanese-Americans were sent to internment
camps beginning in 1942 and ending early in 1946. A federal
commission that originally recommended the payments in 1982
estimated that about 60,000 survive.
   One of those survivors is Rep. Norman Y. Mineta, D-Calif., who
was 10 years old when he and his parents were sent to a camp at
Santa Anita racetrack in Southern California in 1942.
   ``Though this is a deeply personal issue for myself and a
comparatively small number of Americans, this legislation touches
the heart and soul of what it means to be an American, and,
therefore, the very core of our nation,'' said Mineta, who sat in
the speaker's chair for the vote.
   ``I sense history in the making,'' Ben Blaz, the delegate from
Guam, told the House before the vote. Blaz said that he, Maneta and
Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., `were all incarcerated in our youths,
but there was one difference. My guards were enemy soldiers. Theirs
were American soldiers.''
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., an early opponent of the
reparations, said he changed his mind and supported the bill
because ``I see this as an important national apology... It is a
time for apology and reunification and I intend to be a part of
it.''
   But Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., said ``I can argue that in a time
of war when a country is threatened for its very survival, as this
country was, many things happened and many lives were disrupted for
many reasons.''
   Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., said her husband was a Korean
War veteran and that he told her ``if you want a fast divorce you
vote for that legislation.'' Ms. Bentley said she, her husband and
other veterans opposed the bill.
   In addition to benefiting Japanese-American internees, the
legislation authorizes payments of up to $12,000 for surviving
members of the Aleut Indian tribes who were removed from the
Aleutian Islands during the Japanese attack on those islands in
1942.
   It was early in 1942 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed
an order that said the War Department could designate military
areas from which people could be excluded.
   Later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of
Japanese ancestry from California, Washington and Oregon, and some
in Hawaii. The orders affected 77,000 U.S. citizens and 43,000
legal and illegal resident aliens. All were taken to prison camps
in the Western states.
   The last camp was closed in January 1946.

   A federal jury today convicted Rep. Mario Biaggi
of extorting more than $3 million in cash and stock from Wedtech
Corp. in exchange for using his political clout to gain government
contracts for the company.
   The verdict against the 10-term Democrat came on the fifth day
of deliberations in the trial. Four others also were convicted of
racketeering.
   The Bronx congressman and six co-defendants at the four-month
trial were accused of turning Wedtech into a racketeering
enterprise that dispensed millions in bribes to win no-bid
contracts set aside for minority-owned businesses.
   The jury rejected arguments that Wedtech did not need the
Democratic lawmaker because the Bronx defense contractor had
friends in the Reagan White House, including Attorney General Edwin
Meese III. Meese has not been charged with wrongdoing in the
scandal.
   Biaggi, 70, was convicted of all but one of 16 counts, including
conspiracy, extortion, tax evasion and receiving bribes. He faces
up to 20 years in prison on the racketeering counts, the most
serious charges. No sentencing date was set.
   The jury found the former hero police officer guilty of
extorting $50,000 in cash and stock once worth more than $3 million
and filing false financial disclosure statements and income tax
returns to cover up his illegal profits.
   Biaggi removed his glasses, rubbed his eyes and shook his head,
then stared ahead, his hands folded atop his cane, as the verdict
was read.
   The congressman was sentenced in an unrelated case in November
to 2{ years in jail for accepting an illegal gratuity and is free
on appeal.
   The jury today also convicted former Bronx Borough President
Stanley Simon, Wedtech Corp. founder John Mariotta, former Small
Business Administration official Peter Neglia and Biaggi's former
law partner, Bernard Ehrlich, all of racketeering.
   In addition, the jury announced that Richard Biaggi, the
congressman's eldest son, was convicted of racketeering and
conspiracy. But a prosecutor informed the judge that the jury had
found that the younger Biaggi had committed only a single
racketeering act, and at least two are needed to sustain a
racketeering conviction.
   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley ruled that the
younger Biaggi had been acquitted of racketeering and conspiracy
but was convicted of two lesser counts.
   Acquitted of racketeering was Ronald Betso, a former city
policeman and friend of Neglia's.
   After the younger Biaggi was cleared of the racketeering counts,
he walked across the courtroom and hugged and kissed his father.
   The trial, which began March 11, generated nearly 20,000 pages
of transcripts.
   More than 130 witnesses were called, including four former
Wedtech executives who testified for the government in exchange for
leniency. The four admitted bribing public officials, defrauding
the government and stealing from the company _ in concert with
Mariotta.
   At the heart of the Wedtech case was how Welbilt Electronic Die
Corp., a tiny Bronx machine shop started by Mariotta, grew into
Wedtech Corp., a multimillion-dollar defense contractor with
friends in high places.
   Mariotta, a semi-literate tool and die maker of Hispanic
descent, was once hailed as a ``hero for the '80s'' by President
Reagan for hiring ex-convicts and former drug addicts in one of
America's most depressed areas.
   Prosecutors charged that Mariotta and other Wedtech officials
paid bribes in cash, political contributions, stock or stock
options to Biaggi, Simon and Neglia for their assistance with city
and federal agencies.
   Ehrlich, the younger Biaggi and Betso were accused of helping
the others either receive or cover up the payoffs.
   The defense argued that the corrupt Wedtech executives had pull
with White House insiders like Meese and thus did not need to bribe
Biaggi. However, Motley denied a defense request to call Meese as a
witness.
   Prosecutors claimed the ``Meese defense'' was a smokescreen to
divert attention from the defendants.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J. Little stunned the courtroom
during closing arguments when he called Meese ``a sleaze'' but
insisted that any wrongdoing by the attorney general _ Little's
boss _ had nothing to do with the Biaggi case.
   A special prosecutor in Washington has determined there was
insufficient evidence to charge Meese with any wrongdoing, but he
questioned the attorney general's ethics on several issues.
   Biaggi did not take the stand after the judge gave prosecutors
latitude to cross-examine him about his conviction for obstruction
and accepting an illegal gratuity. He was sentenced in November to
2{ years in jail and fined $500,000.
   That conviction was upheld this week by a federal appeals court.
   The House Ethics Committee staff recommended in February that
Biaggi be expelled for the earlier conviction, but decided to put
off action on the matter until Biaggi was available to defend
himself.

<HEAD>Government Lifts Price Restraints, Sure to Fuel Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday lifted
price controls for many goods and services, including energy and
transport, in a measure likely to fuel inflation and social
tensions.
   The widespread lifting of price controls at a time when
inflation is hovering around 180 percent applies to those on
gasoline, diesel fuel, electricity, cooking gas, coal, rail
transport and postal services.
   These prices, strictly controlled by the state for most of the
post World War II period, will be formed freely by their producers,
the state-run press reported.
   Manufacturers of cooking oil, flour and bread also were allowed
price increases, but the staples still will be under government
control, the reports said.
   The government measure has already hit Yugoslavs with a 39
percent increase in the price of electricity, an average 55 percent
rise in the cost of rail transport and a 66 percent rise in the
price of cooking oil.
   Other producers, including those of fuel and bread, have yet to
announce their new prices.
   Workers have staged several protest marches following the
introduction in May of a government program which allowed
substantial price increases and hefty wage cuts.
   The May measures lifted price controls for about 60 percent of
goods and services, which have been frozen since November.
   The steps are designed to curb the country's inflation and repay
the $21 billion foreign debt by introducing a more market-oriented
economy.
   The government, together with the International Monetary Fund
which has helped in designing the program, have set a target that
Yugoslav inflation should drop to 95 percent by the end of 1988.
   The latest official evaluations, however, show that due to the
wave of price increases, prospects are dim that the target will be
reached. According to the most optimistic estimates, Yugoslavia's
annual inflation rate will be at least 130 percent by the end of
1988.
   The unpopular government measures are likely to contribute to a
further decline in living standards, which have already fallen by
at least one third since 1980. Labor unrest is also expected to
grow.
   Anticipating the price increases, most Yugoslavs have been on a
shopping spree in recent weeks for cooking oil and sugar, causing
shortages of those products.

<HEAD>Experts Pinpoint Virus Behind Club Seal Epidemic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish and Dutch scientists have
pinpointed the virus behind the sudden death of thousands of North
Sea club seals, an expert said Thursday.
   ``We can now absolutely dismiss the theories about a herpes
virus,'' the Swedish news agency TT quoted virologist Berndt
Klingeborn as saying.
   Klingborn, of the Biomedical Center in the city of Uppsala, said
the virus belonged to a group known as the Picornaviridae. He said
it was only a matter of weeks before scientists develop a vaccine.
   At least 6,700 seals have been killed in northern European
waters in an epidemic that was first detected in Denmark in
mid-April. Dead seals have been found on Swedish, Danish,
Norwegian, West German and Dutch coasts.
   Klingeborn said scientists worked for months to isolate the
virus believed to undermine the seals' disease-fighting immune
system, leading to fatal pneumonia or liver infection.
   Scientists here and in other northern European countries have
discussed a possible link between the deaths and pollution of the
Baltic and North seas.
   Klingeborn said the seals may have congregated in the few areas
where the water remained clean and food was plentiful, ``and in
that way have been exposed to a greater risk of infection.''
   He said different animals could be victims to different strains
of pircorna viruses, which explained why gray seals were not
affected by the epidemic.

   The question about Michael Dukakis' health
that led to President Reagan's flip retort on Wednesday led to
queries on Thursday about just who may attend and ask questions at
White House briefings.
   ``Everyone who wants a credential gets one,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``If you've got a news outlet that reaches the public, it
defines you as eligible for a White House press pass. I'm certainly
not aware of anyone we don't let in,'' he said.
   Reagan touched off a political flap Wednesday when asked whether
he felt Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, should
release his medical records. The questioner, Nicholas Benton of the
Executive Intelligence Review, a publication founded by political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche, also referred to Dukakis' mental health.
   ``Look, I'm not going to pick on an invalid,'' the president
said. A short time later, he said he had just been kidding and
shouldn't have said what he did.
   Fitzwater was asked at Thursday's news briefing whether the
``invalid'' remark was inadvertent or calculated and whether the
White House took a hand in spreading rumors that Dukakis had
psychiatric problems in the past. The spokesman refused to comment
on all questions relating to Reagan's remark.
   Both Dukakis and his doctor denied the candidate had ever
received psychiatric counseling.
   Fitzwater said Thursday the White House does not make value
judgments in deciding whether Benton _ or some 2,000 other
journalists _ are entitled to press passes.
   Those assigned to cover the White House on a regular basis who
work for ``a recognized news organization'' are accredited,
according to White House rules.
   Fitzwater said courts have held it is a violation of free-press
rights protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution to deny
White House credentials based on a reporter's affiliation.
   But sometimes the lines between advocacy and reporting are
blurry.
   In 1977, the Standing Committee of Correspondents, which helps
administer the congressional press galleries, reprimanded the Rev.
Lester Kinsolving and stripped him of his Capitol Hill press
credentials for accepting money from a foreign government.
   The State Department Correspondents Association revoked
Kinsolving's membership in that organization, an action that did
not prevent Kinsolving from attending department news briefings.
   Kinsolving, an Episcopal priest and syndicated columnist,
acknowledged accepting $2,500 in stock and expenses from a law firm
representing South Africa.
   Kinsolving was reinstated by the congressional press galleries
after he quit working for the South Africans.
   Some reporters protested that Kinsolving was the victim of a
double standard. They noted that, for example, representatives of
the Soviet government news agency Tass were accepted by the
correspondents' groups.
   The White House Correspondents Association does not have any
authority to determine who attends presidential news conferences or
who gets White House press credentials. Kinsolving has been a
frequent questioner at White House briefings.
   From time to time, association members have discussed a policy
that would treat reporters who cover the White House regularly
differently from those who are occasional visitors. But the idea is
to guarantee access to newsworthy events that attract a crowd _ not
bar anyone for their political beliefs.
   The problem of access prompted one reporter Thursday to demand
from Fitzwater an explanation of why a representative of a LaRouche
publication can attend presidential news briefings while reporters
from mid-size out-of-town newspapers have trouble getting through
the White House gate.
   Fizwater promised to look into it.

   The largest testing program yet in a specific
group of Americans has found that just more than one in 1,000
active-duty military personnel have been exposed to the AIDS virus,
lower than among the general population, officials said Thursday.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said 2,232 of 1,752,191
people on active duty on April 24 had tested positive for
antibodies to the virus which causes AIDS, a rate of 1.3 per 1,000.
   The Defense Department began screening for AIDS exposure in
January 1986.
   The active-duty personnel AIDS infection rate ``probably
underrepresents the ... prevalence in the civilian population for
three reasons,'' the CDC said.
   Those reasons are: homosexual men and injectable drug abusers
are, because of rules, less common among military personnel than in
the general population; hemophilia victims are not eligible for
military service; and military recruits who test positive for AIDS
infections are not enlisted.
   AIDS is spread most often through sex or the sharing of infected
hypodermic needles. Hemophilia patients were at risk because of the
blood-derived clotting products they must take, although
purification techniques have greatly lessened that concern.
   Federal health officials have estimated that 1.5 million
Americans are infected with the AIDS virus; that would be roughly
five times the rate among active-duty military personnel.
   Despite the differing infection rates for the two groups, the
military data ``can be used for monitoring levels and trends of ...
infection in the United States,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said in its
weekly report.
   For example, the agency noted, blacks in the military were 3.6
times as likely as whites to test positive for AIDS antibodies, and
Hispanics were 2.5 times as likely.
   Black personnel tested positive at a rate of 2.9 per 1,000,
compared to 2 per 1,000 for Hispanics and 0.8 per 1,000 for whites.
   Although blacks and Hispanics constituted 51 percent of those
testing positive, those groups represented only 23 percent of the
active-duty population.
   Blacks and Hispanics, who make up about 18 percent of the U.S.
population, also have a disproportionate share of the actual AIDS
cases reported in the United States _ 41 percent.
   The Defense Department plans to continue to test all active-duty
personnel for AIDS infections at least every year or two, the CDC
said. ``Therefore, the incidence of new ... infection can be
measured directly.''
   ``This is the closest to a general population in which it will
be possible to actually measure the rate of new infections,'' said
Dr. Tim Dondero, a CDC AIDS specialist.
   A September 1987 report showed seven new infections for every
10,000 Army personnel during a year, the CDC said.
   The Pentagon reported earlier this year that in testing nearly 4
million people since October 1985 _ both recruits and active-duty
personnel _ roughly 1.5 positive AIDS test results were found in
every 1,000 people tested. That figure includes recruits who tested
positive and then were not enlisted.
   The new active-duty findings are ``pretty consistent with what's
been seen in the other groups, particularly the recruits,'' Dondero
said.
   Among active-duty age groups, the highest rate of positive AIDS
tests was among those 25-29 _ 2.1 per 1,000. The lowest was among
personnel 17-19 _ 0.1 per 1,000.

<HEAD>Address Book Found On Hamadi Led to French Arrests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The arrest of a TWA hijack
suspect in West Germany led French police to a group of suspected
Middle East terrorists allegedly involved in the 1986 bombings in
Paris, a police official testified Thursday.
   The testimony came during the trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a
Lebanese Shiite Moslem who is charged with air piracy and murder in
the June 1985 TWA hijacking.
   The hijackers shot and killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem,
and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days after TWA Flight 847
from Athens to Rome was diverted to Beirut.
   Harald Braun, an inspector with the West German federal police,
told the court, ``A telephone number found in Hamadi's address book
led French police to arrest the suspected leader of a terrorist
group.''
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after
customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage.
   Braun said the Paris telephone number found in Hamadi's book
next to the name of ``Ali the Tunisian'' belonged to a man
identified as Fouad Ali Salah.
   Salah was arrested in March 1987 by French police and is
suspected of being the leader of a Hezbollah terrorist cell that
allegedly carried out 10 bomb attacks in Paris in the fall of 1986.
The bombings killed 10 people and injured 270 others.
   Salah and 10 other suspected Hezbollah members are still in
French custody, Braun told the court.
   Hezbollah is a radical Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group in
Lebanon that is suspected of holding Western hostages. One of
Mohammed Hamadi's brothers, Abdul-Hadi, is Hezbollah's security
chief in Beirut.
   Another Hamadi brother, Abbas, was convicted by a West German
court in Apil of masterminding the kidnapping of two West Germans
in Beirut in an attempt to force the West German government to free
Mohammed. Abbas Hamadi was sentenced to 13 years in prison.
   One West German, Alfred Schmidt, was released in September, but
the second, Rudolf Cordes, remains a hostage.
   During his trial that began in July, Mohammed Hamadi has denied
being a member of Hezbollah. He has also testified that some of the
numbers found in his telephone book had been written by a man in
Beirut at whose home he had left the book for several days.
   Braun also told the court that French police seized seven
bottles of liquid explosives when they arrested Salah.
   ``The explosives were of exactly the same type found in Hamadi's
luggage,'' Braun said.
   After Hamadi's arrest in Frankfurt, more of the same explosives
where found buried in the West German state of Saarland, near the
French border. Hamadi has admitted to smuggling the explosives into
West Germany in January 1987.
   Braun testified that French police also found the telephone
number of Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut when they arrested Salah.
   Earlier Thursday, another witness testified that Hamadi sought
to trade freedom from prison for the two West German hostages in
Lebanon.
   Gabriel Lapite said Hamadi gave him the telephone number of a
sister in Beirut with the request: ``Tell her that my brother
should start to go to work. Both Germans should not be freed unless
I am released.''
   Lapite, a Nigerian who was imprisoned on drug charges in a cell
near Hamadi's for three months in 1987, did not say which of
Hamadi's brothers was to be contacted. He also did not say if he
placed the phone call, and Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger did not
ask him.
   Lapite testified that Mohammed Hamadi gave him five letters to
mail to family members and friends. Lapite said he did not mail the
letters and gave them to police.
   Reiner Hamm, a lawyer representing hijack victims and their
families in the trial, said the letters tried to arrange Hamadi's
release from prison.
   The trial will take a four-week recess after a hearing on
Tuesday.

<HEAD>New Foam-Making Process Doesn't Use Ozone-Destroying Chemicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. said Thursday it has found a
way to avoid using ozone-destroying chemicals in making foam used
for furniture padding.
   The technology could eliminate 70 percent of the use of
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons in the flexible foam industry,
which now accounts for 12 percent to 15 percent of the world's
chlorofluorocarbon use, said John Televantos of the company.
   Carbide immediately will start selling the ingredients to make
the new polyurethane foam, company representatives said at a news
conference.
   Chlorofluorocarbons eat away at the atmosphere's ozone layer,
which blocks out harmful solar rays. Scientists say further
thinning of the ozone layer could increase skin cancers.
   Last September, two dozen nations signed a treaty to reduce the
use of CFCs.
   Foam manufacturers use CFCs to make foam softer. They can also
use methylene chloride, but that may also be phased out by federal
regulators because it is suspected of causing cancer, Carbide
officials said.
   Officials declined to give details of the new technology, citing
patent considerations. The new foam, called Ultracel, also provides
improved comfort, support and durability, officials said.
   The foam is not a practical substitute for providing bulk, as in
the armrest of a chair, or for some packaging, said Televantos.

<HEAD>Workers Offered New Way to Check Retirement Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Security Administration said
Thursday it can provide free, detailed individual financial
statements to workers estimating how large a benefit check they
will get each month when they retire.
   The new ``Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement''
will also disclose how much a worker and family would get each
month in disability or survivors' benefits.
   The computer-generated disclosure statements will be available
by mail free on written request from anyone who has paid Social
Security taxes, is under 65 years old and is not yet drawing
benefits.
   The statements fulfill a promise that President Reagan made in
his last State of the Union address, and caps a two-year drive by
Social Security Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy to give the public a
better idea of their personal stake in the huge retirement,
disability and survivors' program.
   Those interested can call a toll-free number _ 1-800-937-2000 _
to request copies of the disclosure form, SSA-7004.
   All they have to do is fill it out, put a stamp on it and the
agency will send back their statement in two to three weeks, Hardy
said at a news conference.
   Social Security pays out more than $200 billion a year in cash
benefits to 38 million retirees, disabled workers and their
families, but ``it is probably the most misunderstood program in
the entire federal government,'' Hardy said.
   She said many people do not understand the survivors' and
disability protection, and others confuse it with ``a private
savings or checkings account.''
   ``By putting a precise dollars and cents value on those
benefits, and individualizing it for the person making the request,
Social Security will no longer seem so mysterious and complex,''
she said.
   Some private companies charge people for making the kind of
estimates that Social Security now will be doing free.
   Hardy said it ``will serve as a viable financial planning tool
and I urge everyone to take advantage of this new, improved
service.''
   Social Security's old earnings statement form has been widely
criticized as hard to read, confusing and skimpy on useful
information. The agency generally provided estimates of benefits at
age 65 only for those 60 or older.
   For younger workers, Hardy said, benefit estimations were
``extremely difficult. We could not have supplied this by mail. We
could do it by hand-calculation if you insisted in a district
office ... but we really were not in the business of providing that
kind of service at all.''
   The new form asks people to list their name, nine-digit Social
Security number, date of birth, actual earnings from last year and
estimated earnings this year, as well as the age at which they plan
to retire.
   The form also asks for a single estimate of future average
yearly earnings, but advises that ``most people should enter the
same amount as this year's estimated earnings.''
   The agency then will mail back a computer-generated booklet
spelling out how much in Social Security-covered wages the person
earned each year since 1951, and estimating how much he or she paid
in payroll taxes. It will give a lump sum for 1937-1950.
   The booklet will tell how many credits a person has earned
toward Social Security coverage. A worker now gets one credit for
each $470 of wages, up to a maximum of four credits a year, and
needs 20 credits to be insured for disability and 40 credits for
retirement benefits.
   Then it will give estimates in today's dollars of how much the
person would get if he or she retires at 62, 65 or 70. For younger
workers, who will be expected to work until 66 or 67 to draw full
retirement benefits, that age is used instead of 65.
   Estimates also are given for payments to widows or widowers and
children under 18 on death or disability.
   The old earnings statement provided only a fraction of this
information. It broke out individual earnings only for the four
most recent years and did not list how much tax was paid.
   Hardy expressed hope that the financial notices would remind
people to plan early for their retirement _ and that Social
Security was never intended as a complete source of retirement
income.
   She said $300,000 in new computer software was required for the
service, and the agency now expects to get 6 million requests a
year for earnings statements, double the 3 million it has been
handling. It will cost 37 cents to fulfill each request, up from 33
cents previously.
   The Social Security Administration expects the program to help
it detect errors in its earnings records. About three percent of
the 1,600 people in a pilot test found mistakes on their earnings
statements.
   Those who detect errors must provide documentation of their
actual earnings to ensure their benefits are in the right amount,
Hardy said.
   Social Security has always encouraged people to check their
earnings record every three years. It says the law only allows it
to correct errors caught within about 40 months of their occurrence.

<TEXT>
   A Briton who produced a BBC-TV
documentary alleging that detained black youths were maltreated
won't be allowed unrestricted access to South Africa, the
government said Thursday.
   The Home Affairs Department said Nicholas Claxton was no longer
entitled to the exemption that enables British citizens to visit
South Africa without a visa.
   Claxton, a free-lance producer, was commissioned by the British
Boradcasting Corp. to produce ``Suffer the Children,'' a
documentary shown in Britain in June that alleged young blacks had
been tortured and mistreated while in detention.
   Gerrie van Zyl, director-general of home affairs, said one of
the reasons for the punitive action was that government officials
had not been given a chance to view the documentary or comment on
it prior to its broadcast.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said ``Suffer the Children''
was a ``despicable propaganda film,'' which illustrated how ``lies,
distortions and exaggerations are being used agianst South Africa
to isolate it from the rest of the world.''
   Vlok said police have been investigating the allegations made in
the docuentary and have yet to find any evidence to support the
charges.
   Human rights activists say several thousand black youths have
been detained without charge for varying periods during the state
of emergency declared in June 1986.
   The government says no youths under 16 are in detention, but it
has not disclosed comprehensive figures.
   The Bureau for Information is distributing a booklet defending
the policy of detaining children, saying some of these youths had
committed atrocities.

compensation to the families of the 290 people killed in the U.S.
destruction of an Iranian jetliner last month faces serious hurdles
in Congress and may not be approved, House members said Thursday.
   ``I think you're going to have serious trouble selling what
you're trying to sell,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., told State
and Defense department officials.
   Skelton said the Iranian government bears a heavy burden of
responsibility for dispatching the Iran Air Airbus into a Persian
Gulf combat zone where it was destroyed by missiles from the U.S.
cruiser Vincennes.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, told reporters that Congress might be persuaded to
appropriate funds for humanitarian compensation to the families if
it is established that mistakes by the Vincennes crew during combat
caused the downing of the plane.
   Pentagon sources said Wednesday that preliminary findings of an
official investigation show that human error rather than
malfunctioning equipment caused the Vincennes to fire on the
jetliner July 3.
   Aspin told State and Defense department witnesses at the hearing
that they face ``a tough sell'' in obtaining compensation funds
from Congress because ``the visceral reaction against the Iranian
government runs very deep.''
   Aspin said the chances for approval of compensation would be a
lot higher if there is an end to the eight-year Iran-Iraq war and
to attacks on international shipping in the gulf.
   Several committee members said they would oppose paying
compensation unless there were ``absolute guarantees'' that the
money would go only to victims' families and not benefit the
Iranian government in any way.
   ``While we want to be humanitarian, we don't want to be naive,''
said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   Aspin added: ``Unless there are absolute guarantees there are
going to be absolute problems.''
   Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser, said the
offer to pay compensation flows from a traditional American spirit
of compassion and humanity.
   He said all nations except the Soviet Union have paid
compensation after the destruction of a civilian aircraft because
``civilized nations pay these kind of obligations.''
   Safaer said he believes it would be ``inappropriate'' to link
humanitarian payments to other issues, such as the release of
hostages held by Iranian-backed radicals in Lebanon.
   ``This is not a nation-to-nation deal,'' Sofaer said. ``This is
a nation-to-people deal.''
   He said the United States will make every effort to ensure that
Tehran government does not benefit from the payments.
   ``We are going to pay this money to people or we're not going to
pay it,'' Sofaer said.
   He said, however, that cooperation from Iranian authorities
probably will be essential if the victims' families are to be
identified accurately and appropiate payment made.
   He said that if there were no cooperation and survivors proved
impossible to identify with certainty, that likely would end the
matter.
   Even with the administration's best efforts, Sofaer testified,
``we will need a considerable amount of time to determine how to
assess compensation and to obtain the information necessary from
the families or their governments.''

   There is compelling evidence moderate alcohol
consumption increases the risk of breast cancer, say doctors at
Harvard School of Public Health who analyzed 16 recent studies on
the issue.
   But another researcher said that, in general, the studies
conducted so far suggest a very weak association at most and
possibly none at all.
   In addition, another study suggests that women who drink
moderate amounts of alcohol reduce their risk of heart attacks and
a common form of stroke.
   In an effort to make sense of conflicting findings in recent
years, doctors at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston pooled
results of 16 studies dating to 1982, weighting each study
according to their judgment of its quality.
   The researchers found ``compelling'' evidence that breast cancer
risk goes up with increasing alcohol consumption, they reported in
Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   However, the findings do not prove alcohol causes breast cancer,
because ``association does not prove cause and effect,'' and
unknown factors may be responsible for the heightened risk, said
the researchers, led by Dr. Matthew P. Longnecker.
   They also noted that one or two drinks a day _ shown to protect
against heart or blood vessel disease _ may provide a benefit
outweighing the increased risk of breast cancer.
   The heightened breast cancer risk for moderate drinkers ranged
from 1.4 times greater to 1.7 times greater than for non-drinkers,
the researchers said.
   But Dr. Randall E. Harris, chief of epidemiology for the
American Health Foundation in New York City, said the Harvard study
contains no new data and ``it is somewhat arbitrary how you weight
different studies.''
   He and colleague Ernst L. Wynder co-wrote a study in JAMA three
months ago, reporting on 1,467 women with breast cancer and 10,178
women without who demonstrated ``no evidence that alcohol has a
role in the genesis of breast cancer.''
   ``We haven't changed our minds,'' Harris said in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   The JAMA analysis divided the studies into two groups, depending
upon how they were set up. The Harris-Wynder study was ranked ninth
of 12 in its group.
   ``The issue of breast cancer and alcohol _ in order to be
resolved _ is going to rely on studies that prove or disprove a
physiological mechanism,'' Harris said. ``At present, I'm not aware
of such a mechanism.''
   In the meantime, most women may want to choose whether to drink
by weighing probabilities, suggested Dr. William Castelli, director
of the Framingham Heart Study, a 40-year survey of thousands of
subjects to explore the factors that may cause people to get heart
disease.
   He noted that while one in 25 women is expected to die of breast
cancer, about one in two is expected to succumb to heart or blood
vessel disease.
   ``You're way ahead of the game in trying to prevent the thing
that's most likely to happen to you,'' he said in a telephone
interview Wednesday from Framingham, Mass.
   But women whose risk of getting breast cancer is already known
to be above average ``shouldn't drink at all,'' he said.
   Women at greater risk for cancer include those with a strong
family history of it; those who have no children or who have had
children after age 30; obesity; and early onset of menstrual
periods and late menopause.
   ``There are probably better ways to prevent atherosclerosis
(fatty buildup in the arteries) than by drinking it away,''
Castelli said. ``That's by a sensible diet _ curtailing your
saturated fats.''

<HEAD>Homeowners Upset By Property Sinkage Into Cow Graves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of one neighborhood are
suffering a phenomenon they called ``Cow-geist,'' after the movie
``Poltergeist.'' But their problem isn't ghosts, it's houses
sinking into mass cattle graves.
   ``I just think it's weird,'' said homeowner Ken Zion. ``It makes
me upset. I'm upset I bought a house that might be sinking into cow
trenches.''
   The problem stems form an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in
the 1920s that wiped out nearly all of the dairy cattle in Long
Beach, said Llewellyn Bixby, chairman of the Bixby Land Co.
   The dead cows were bulldozed into mass graves.
   Some of the burial trenches may be as deep as 18 feet, said
Zion, who said he received a settlement of several thousand dollars
from the previous owner of his house after a corner of his garage
started sinking six years ago.
   Eventually, houses were built over the bovine burial site, as
houses were built over a cemetery in ``Poltergeist.'' As the
carcasses decomposed, the ground settled, real estate agents said.
   One agent said nine lots have suffered subsidence, and one
homeowner estimated that as many as 20 homes may be at risk.
   Land subsidence in Long Beach, which was known in the 1950s as
``the sinking city,'' is not unusual.
   The problem then, however, was caused by oil wells pumping up
crude oil from the western part of the city. Water was eventually
injected into the ground to counter the effect.
   Kay Coop, an agent for JTM Brokerage Corp., said one of her
clients bought in the area without being told of the adverse
effects from the cow cemetery.
   ``It should have been declared,'' said Ms. Coop. ``Who would
ever think to look for dead cows?''
   City Planning Director Robert Paternoster said no one had told
him of of the problem. Senior Deputy City Attorney Arthur Honda
said he also hadn't heard of the problem, but said the city would
not be liable for such an occurrence.

<HEAD>`On-Track' Angola Talks Extended</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-mediated negotiations among Angola, Cuba and
South Africa on a peace settlement in southern Africa are ``on
track,'' a U.S. spokesman said Thursday, and the four countries
agreed to extend the talks.
   The negotiators agreed to end the meeting Friday, one day beyond
the originally scheduled closing date, sources close to the talks
said.
   Art Skop, the mission spokesman, said ``the negotiations are on
track and the full agenda of issues is under discussion.'' He
declined to elaborate.
   Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, who mediates the
talks, planned to give a news conference Friday.
   Skop's statement suggested that a controversy which arose
earlier in the week over South African peace proposals had not
derailed the negotiations.
   The proposals were unexpectedly unveiled Tuesday night in
Pretoria by Foreign Minister Pik Botha. They called for a
cease-fire by Aug. 10 in the 13-year-old Angolan war and made
independence for South-West Africa conditional on the withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola by next June 1.
   South-West Africa also is known as Namibia.
   The Cuban and Angolan delegations in Geneva rejected the
proposals, with Cuba calling ``preposterous and unrealistic.'' The
two countries have said such a condition amounts to interference in
their affairs.
   Cuba previously offered to pull its estimated 50,000 troops out
of Angola over a four-year period. The troops have helped the
Marxist government fight UNITA, the rebel movement of Jonas
Savimbi, which receives military aid from South Africa and the
United States.
   In South Africa, Botha said Wednesday night that
counterproposals were being discussed in Geneva, but he did not
elaborate.
   South Africa's public announcement of its proposals irritated
Crocker because the negotiating partners had earlier agreed to keep
the talks confidential, according to U.S. sources.
   The southern Africa talks began in May in London and are in
their fifth round. The current round began on an upbeat note after
a previous round July 20 in New York produced for the first time a
joint document in which Cuba, Angola and South Africa accepted a
set of 14 principles as a framework for a settlement.
   On Tuesday, South Africa also proposed to start withdrawing its
estimated 50,000 troops from Namibia on Nov. 1.
   South Africa's mandate over Namibia was terminated by the United
Nations in 1966, but in defiance of several U.N. Security Council
resolutions, it has retained control of the mineral-wealthy country.
   On Thursday in Luanda, Angola, Sam Nujoma, leader of the South
West African People's Organization, or SWAPO, the main guerrilla
group fighting for Namibian independence, charged that South Africa
had reinforced its troops in Namibia recently. He said this raised
questions about the sincerity of the government's offer to withdraw.
   South Africa also called for the dismantling of seven guerrilla
camps which it said were operated in Angola by the African National
Congress, the main black group fighting white rule in South Africa.
   The New York principles did not mention the ANC's role, nor
those of UNITA or SWAPO, which is reported to have bases in Angola.
   In Pretoria, President P.W. Botha met on Thursday with leaders
of Namibia's multiracial interim government and gave assurances
that they would be consulted about developments in the
negotiations. Botha stressed that no agreement on independence for
the territory had been reached.
   Dirk Mudge, a moderate white Cabinet minister who headed the
Namibian delegation, said after the meeting he hoped the
international community would extend support to Namibia if
independence was obtained.
   However, the conservative National Party of South-West Africa _
the territory's largest white party _ reaffirmed its opposition to
any settlement providing for one-man, one-vote elections.
   Only about 70,000 of Namibia's 1.3 million people are white.

   A major forest fire threatened the
Adriatic industrial city of Sibenik, disrupted traffic and knocked
out electricity, it was reported Thursday.
   The blaze near the city of 50,000 people was being aggravated by
a strong southerly wind, the official Tanjug news agency said.
   Traffic on the coastal highway 40 miles north of the
mid-Adriatic port of Split was detoured.
   It was the first major blaze reported this year on the Adriatic
coast which had been afflicted by extensive fires two years ago.
The cause of the fire was not known, Tanjug said.

<HEAD>American Envoy Hopes For Smooth Presidential Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Murphy met with government leaders Thursday in a visit designed to
help ensure smooth presidential elections in a nation torn by years
of civil war.
   There was speculation that Murphy's visit, which was not
announced in advance, might be tied to talks on the nine American
hostages held in Lebanon. But Murphy did not meet with any
officials thought to have direct influence over the fate of the
captives.
   ``The new president will face many challenges,'' Murphy said
after a three-hour meeting with President Amin Gemayel, a Maronite
Catholic.
   ``He will have to achieve constitutional reforms and consolidate
national entente ... The new president must be a symbol and an
advocate of national unity and reconciliation.''
   The new president is to be elected by Lebanon's Parliament.
Gemayel's term expires Sept. 23, and the vote must take place at
least a week before he leaves office.
   Murphy left Beirut for Damascus, Syria, for talks with Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
   The United States and Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon,
have been trying to bring Lebanon's Moslems and Christians to agree
on political reforms to end a 13 year-old civil war. The war has
killed 130,000 people and wrecked the nation's once-booming economy.
   In south Beirut, a Syrian-backed guerrilla force patrolled
Beirut's two war-devastated refugee camps with orders to prevent
PLO leader Yasser Arafat's loyalists from filtering back.
   The force, made up of 280 men, set up 10 positions inside the
sprawling Bourj el-Barajneh camp on Beirut's southern edge and
seven posts at the nearby Chatilla shantytown.
   The ``Joint Security Force'' comprises three Syrian-supported
Palestinian factions _ the breakaway Fatah-Uprising, the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command and the
al-Saiqa.
   PLO dissidents of the Fatah-Uprising group evicted Arafat's
supporters from Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh after a battle in
June and July that left 127 people killed and 527 wounded.
   Arafat's Fatah supporters relocated in Palestinian refugee camps
in south Lebanon's port city of Sidon.
   In addition to Gemayel, Murphy met with Parliament Speaker
Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, and acting Prime Minister Selim
Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, in west Beirut.
   It was not known if Murphy raised the issue of the hostages at
the talks.
   Most of the 18 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon are believed
held in Beirut's southern slums by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
factions.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   There's no sauerkraut in Phelps' annual
sauerkraut festival this year, but the party's going on anyway so
there won't be a lot of sour pusses around town.
   This upstate New York village lost its once-thriving sauerkraut
industry, and its boast of being the ``Sauerkraut Capital of the
World,'' this spring when one of its two plants closed and the
other company moved its operation out of town.
   ``It's sad about the sauerkraut. But a festival is a festival
and this is the only one we've got to give everybody in the village
a little lift to get through the end of summer,'' said Fran Magill,
co-chairwoman of the 22nd annual Phelps Sauerkraut Festival.
   The festival began Thursday night and continues through the
weekend.
   Until March, Phelps had been producing the pungent, chopped-up
cabbage for 84 years.

   Your waiter takes your drink order and begins
reciting the day's specials and before he's through, your drink has

   A clairvoyant bartender? A waiter faster than a speeding bullet?
No, try radio waves.
   Waiters at the Cafe Roma use a hand-held device equipped with an
electronic keyboard with numbered keys. By punching the appropriate
key, the order is sent via radio waves to computer printers in the
kitchen and bar.
   ``I think in this heat they really appreciate it because they
don't have to go into the kitchen as much,'' cafe co-owner Janet
Sossi Belcoure said. ``They can be more attentive to the
customers.''
   Belcoure, with her father, Hector Sossi, owns and operates the
restaurant, which she said is nearly a century old and is believed
to be the longest continually operating restaurant in Detroit.
   ``We wanted to computerize. As the industry's becoming more
competitive, we needed a system to keep better control over what's
coming and going out.''
   The hand-held units, produced by Remanco Systems Co. of Danvers,
Mass., stay with the waiter _ no floor space is needed.
   The waiters at Roma Cafe have been there an average of 10 years,
Belcoure said, but were ready to accept the new technology.
   ``We had a couple of rough weeks, you know, it's new,'' she
said. ``But waiters caught on quickly.''

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes In Kabul Hours Before Shevardnadze Arrives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A truck bomb exploded and killed at
least three people in a crowded bazaar in Kabul on Thursday,
several hours before Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
arrived in the Afghan capital.
   State-run Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said three
passersby and the driver of the truck died and that 18 people were
injured; but the Soviet news agency Tass reported in Moscow that
only three people died and nine were injured. Both blamed the
attack on Moslem insurgents.
   Shevardnadze's visit, which was not announced before Tass said
he had arrived in Kabul, came one day after he sharply criticized
his Pakistani counterpart, Yaqub Khan, during a meeting in Moscow.
   Shevardnadze accused Khan's nation of ``international
terrorism'' for its continued support of insurgents fighting the
Soviet-backed Afghan government. The alleged assistance is
occurring as the Soviet Union withdraws its troops.
   Tass said in a two-sentence report Thursday that Shevardnadze
was met at the Kabul airport by Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil and
other Afghan officials.
   The dispatch said without elaborating that Shevardnadze was on a
``working visit'' and that Khan had left Moscow to return to
Pakistan.
   The Soviet Union has been increasingly critical of what
Shevardnadze called Pakistan's ``unceasing massive dispatches'' of
arms to the guerrillas.
   The Afghanistan government also has made scores of complaints
about what it says is Pakistani assistance to the insurgents.
   Shevardnadze told Khan that Afghan guerrillas recently stepped
up their bombardment of Afghan towns and that hundreds of innocent
people were killed or wounded in the past two months.
   ``Islamabad's support for such actions cannot be described other
than as international terrorism,'' he told the Pakistani official.
   He said the Soviet Union and Afghanistan would find ways to
counter Pakistan's alleged interference, but did not specify them.
   The Soviet Union is withdrawing its force of more than 100,000
soldiers from Afghanistan under the terms of an April 14 agreement
signed in Geneva by the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the
United States.
   Half the Soviet soldiers are to withdrawn by Aug. 15 with the
remainder out by Feb. 15. Soviet and Afghan officials say 35,000
already have left.
   At a regular news briefing Thursday, Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said all four parties should abide by the
Geneva agreement.
   ``They have equal rights, and of course if one side would
continue violating the agreements, the Soviet Union can take
appropriate steps,'' he said. ``But I would like to emphasize that
the measures the Soviet Union might take would be aimed at further
implementation of the agreement. We believe that Geneva must work
and that the settlement in Afghanistan should continue.''
   Radio Kabul blamed Afghan guerrillas allied with the
Hezb-e-Islami Party for the truck bomb. Guerrilla leaders and field
commanders have denied planting explosives in residential areas of
Kabul or hitting them with rockets.
   Bombing and rocket attacks on Kabul have increased since the
Soviet troop withdrawl began. Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan
in December 1979, replaced one pro-Soviet government with another
and remained to fight the insurgents. Soviet officials say more
than 13,000 of their soldiers died in the conflict.

   The Communist Party said Thursday that two
prominent Bolsheviks were innocent of anti-Soviet activity and
political mistakes, the charges Josef Stalin used to destroy them
in the 1930s.
   The report on the work of a commission of the ruling Politburo
distributed by the Tass news agency was not a political
rehabiliation of Bolshevik leaders Grigory Zinoviev or Lev Kamenev,
but it indicated such a move probably was not far behind.
   Tass said the commission had received a report from the Soviet
Supreme Court, which has cleared the names of several old
Bolsheviks this year, and that it was continuing its work.
   The party under Mikhail S. Gorbachev has sought to clear the
names of its leaders purged by Stalin in the 1930s to erase his
legacy of repression and assure party members they won't be
punished for speaking their minds.
   In June, the Supreme Court cleared Zinoviev, Kamenev, Karl Radek
and Grigory Pyatikov of criminal charges of which they were
convicted in the 1930s. Zinoviev, Kamenev and Pyatikov were shot,
and Radek died in a prison camp.
   Among the first Bolshevik leaders to be cleared was Nikolai
Bukharin, who in February was declared innocent of the charges for
which he was shot. On July 9, the Politburo committee posthumously
readmitted him to the party.
   His case was considered important because Gorbachev's reforms
follow many of the concepts Bukharin developed.
   Zinoviev and Kamenev are not so strongly identified with
particular policies as was Bukharin, but along with Vladimir Lenin,
Leon Trotsky, and Stalin were leaders of the Bolshevik Party when
it seized power in 1917.
   After first teaming up with Stalin to eliminate all opposition,
Zinoviev and Kamenev were themselves accused in 1932-33 of heading
an underground group seeking to re-establish capitalism.
   ``It has been established that the investigation of this affair
was carried out with gross violations of the law,'' the report said.
   It said Zinoviev and Kamenev never were told what charges they
faced, and that ``the materials of the affair contain no evidence
of anti-Soviet activity.''
   ``Concerning their political and theoretical views laid out in
the program documents, they were of a discussion character and did
not contain appeals to replace, undermine or weaken Soviet power,''
the report said.
   When Bukharin was readmitted to the party last month, the
committee said he had made political mistakes, but they did not
justify the criminal charges against him, or his exclusion from the
party.
   The commission report contained a lengthy list of lesser-known
Bolshevik officials who also were shot or sentenced to prison
during Stalin's purges.
   They were tried for alleged membership in subversive groups that
Stalinist prosecutors called the ``Union of Marxist-Leninists,''
``The Moscow Center,'' ``Anti-Soviet Trotsky-Zinoviev Center,'' and
the ``Parallel Anti-Soviet Trotsky Center.''
   The report said prosecutors falsified evidence in a 1935 trial
in which Zinoviev, Kamenev and 19 others were accused of forming
the ``Moscow Center.'' It said prosecutors alleged the ``Moscow
Center'' was an underground terrorist group led by Zinoviev that
helped plan the 1934 assassination of Sergei Kirov, the popular
Leningrad party leader.
   The memoirs of Anastas Mikoyan, a Bolshevik leader who survived
the purges, were published last year and said that resentment of
Stalin led some communists to try to replace him with Kirov at a
1934 party conference.
   Some historians believe Stalin himself was behind the killing of
Kirov, and that the dictator then accused his political opponents
of planning the assassination as an excuse to have them shot.
   There have been no steps toward the rehabiliation of Trotsky,
Stalin's first and most serious opponent for power after the death
of Lenin in 1924, although some historians have suggested it.
   Trotsky was thrown out of the Communist Party, banished from the
country and murdered in Mexico City in 1940.

   Calvin Graham had a lump in his throat
Thursday and couldn't testify, but House Speaker Jim Wright made
the case for the disabled World War II hero who has been denied
military benefits because he lied about his age and enlisted in the
Navy when he was 12.
   ``From a narrowly legal point of view, perhaps those who so long
have thwarted efforts to restore simple justice to Calvin Graham
may feel they were justified. But on the basis of common sense,
ethics, morality, valor, simple decency, justice and fairness, they
were painfully wrong,'' Wright, D-Texas, said.
   ``The denial of full benefits to Calvin Graham brings a pall of
shame over the government of the United States,'' the speaker said
as his wheelchair-bound constituent sat at his side during a
hearing by a House Judiciary subcommittee.
   When asked whether he wanted to testify on legislation to give
him disability benefits and back pay, Graham, 58, said: ``I've got
a lump in my throat right now.''
   Graham, of Fort Worth, says patriotism was at a fevered pitch in
1942 when, weighing 125 pounds and standing at 5-feet-2, he joined
the Navy in Houston and was assigned to the USS South Dakota as an
anti-aircraft gun loader.
   After shrapnel ripped through his mouth during the battle of
Guadalcanal, Graham said he remained aboard the ship's deck
applying tourniquets to those who had lost an arm or leg.
   The military has fought Graham at every turn since he was
slammed in the brig in Corpus Christi, Texas, upon his return from
the Pacific, and it took the Navy until 1978 to grant him an
honorable discharge and award him his medals, including the Bronze
Star, Wright said.
   In 1980, the government decided to give him $337 in back pay for
the three months he spent confined in the brig and his
mustering-out benefits, which would have been right amount at the
time of his discharge in 1943. He was also granted disability
status for one tooth, although he said he lost all of his teeth
because of war wounds.
   Legislation introduced by Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, seeks to
grant Graham disability benefits for his mouth injuries and back
pay in 1988 dollars, with interest.
   Graham's story was the subject of a CBS television movie, ``Too
Young The Hero,'' earlier this year.
   Wright said the government has turned a cold shoulder to Graham,
``even though President Roosevelt is said to have offered his help
shortly before his death and President Reagan in a California radio
address during his campaign for the presidency described Calvin
Graham's case as the kind of problem he wanted to address if
elected. So let's help him do it.''
   John Thompson, legal counsel for the Veterans Adminstration, in
response to questioning by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said he had
not heard of any request from the administrtion to help Graham.
Thompson said there was no need for Frost's bill.
   Graham rejoined the service when he reached the proper age and
served with the Marines during the Korean War. He said he broke his
back and his right ankle when he lost his footing and fell from a
pier in California, and those injuries now keep him in a wheelchair.
   ``I remember everything that happened to me that year like it
was yesterday,'' he said in an interview. ``It burns in my mind. I
dream about it a lot.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Thursday
that Israel will block the PLO from taking Jordan's place in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Jordan said it will lay off or retire the 21,200 Palestinian
employees of its institutions in the occupied territories, which
effectively turns over responsibility to the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The action has the greatest practical effect of any taken since
King Hussein's announcement Sunday that he was cutting links with
the territories, where 1.5 million Palestinians live.
   Shamir said Jordan's decision would put ``pressure on the PLO
and the Palestinian Arabs'' but would not change Israeli policy.
   ``We are still commited to our international obligations. We
will negotiate about peace with Palestinians, but never with the
PLO,'' he told reporters.
   ``King Hussein wants to deliver these Palestinians into the
hands of the PLO terrorists to struggle against Israel for their
so-called liberation.''
   Right-wing Israelis said Shamir should take the opportunity
presented by Hussein to assert Israeli claims to the West Bank.
   ``Long live the king,'' Jewish settler Eliakim Haetzni said in
an interview, saluting with his right hand. ``What happens now
depends on our response. Israel must either turn this over to (PLO
leader Yasser) Arafat or annex it.''
   Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Legislator Geula Cohen of the right-wing Tehiya Party met with
Shamir to press demands that Israel annex the West Bank to fill the
power void left by Jordan. Shamir rejected the proposal, although
his Likud bloc believes the area is an inextricable part of the
historic land of Israel.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that, if Hussein was trying to
encourage negotiations between Israel and the PLO, ``he must
understand clearly that for this option there is no Israeli
partner.''
   Israel would ``object to the PLO taking Jordan's place and
paying salaries'' in the territories, he said.

   Conservative Republicans said Thursday that
George Bush is headed for defeat in November if he chooses a
running mate from the GOP's ``establishment blue-bloods.''
   Bush, the certain Republican presidential nominee, is weighing a
number of choices for the ticket's No. 2 spot and has indicated he
will wait until the GOP convention in New Orleans Aug. 15-18 to
announce his decision.
   Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., chairman of the Coalition for a
Winning Ticket, declined to single out the group's ideal vice
presidential candidate. But he did say conservatives were
disappointed by the selection of Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey as
the convention's keynote speaker.
   Kean, who has been mentioned as a possible Bush running mate, is
from the party's moderate wing and, like Bush, has an Ivy League
background.
   ``The problem of the Bush campaign is that it is attracted to
establishment blue-bloods. What the Bush ticket needs is a
transfusion of red corpuscles from the conservative wing of our
party,'' Humphrey said at a news conference.
   Humphrey said a number of other possible Bush running mates from
the party's moderate wing also were not acceptable to
conservatives, including Richard Thornburgh, the former
Pennsylvania governor who has been chosen to succeed Attorney
General Edwin Meese III; Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois; former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, and former Tennessee Sen. and White
House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr.
   ``If George Bush selects an establishment Republican as his
running mate, we believe we are headed for a disaster in
November,'' Humphrey said.
   He described Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, Rep. Jack Kemp of New
York and Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire as acceptable to
conservatives.
   He was equivocal on other possible candidates, including Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, Dole's wife Elizabeth Hanford Dole, Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming. He
said, however, that conservatives would probably not be
enthusiastic about them.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis met for nearly four hours with Farm Belt lawmakers to
assure them of his commitment to changing federal policies, Sen.
Tom Harkin said Thursday.
   Harkin also said Dukakis signaled a willingness to devote
substantial campaign time and effort to the Midwest.
   ``He's got some ideas now for campaigning in the Midwest coming
up very shortly which I think will draw a lot of attention,'' said
Harkin during a conference call with reporters.
   ``He keeps coming back to his time in Iowa,'' Harkin said. ``He
just thinks there's something out there he can tap into.''
   Harkin said he met with Dukakis at his Brookline, Mass., home
Wednesday night, along with former Democratic presidential
candidate Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the chairmen of the
House and Senate agriculture committees and other Midwestern
lawmakers.
   ``He just wanted a long uninterrupted discussion of
agriculture,'' Harkin said.
   While Dukakis said he will contest the Midwest, he has
substantial hurdles to overcome. He finished third in Iowa's
precinct caucuses and was criticized for his suggestion that Iowa
farmers should grow Belgian endive to diversify crops.
   ``I think he'd be the first to admit that he's not an expert,''
Harkin said. ``What he has, and I think what people will recognize,
is he is intelligent and he cares and he has a deep sense of the
necessity of having a viable rural America.''
   Dukakis has campaigned twice in Iowa since the Feb. 8 caucuses,
and has scheduled a brief visit to Cedar Rapids on Saturday. Harkin
said he discussed other campaign plans with the Democratic nominee,
but declined to be specific.
   ``I have no doubt in my mind he is committed to making
substantial changes in both farm and rural policy,'' Harkin said.
   ``He saw the close-knit relationship between people who live in
small towns and communities and farmers,''' the Iowa senator said.

   Roger L. Stevens, founding chairman of the
Kennedy Center, was among five prominent Americans chosen Thursday
to receive this year's Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime
achievements in the performing arts.
   The other winners are choreographer Alvin Ailey, actor George
Burns, actress Myrna Loy and violinist Alexander Schneider.
   President Reagan will pay tribute to the medalists at a White
House ceremony on Dec. 4. That evening, they will be honored at a
gala performance at the Kennedy Center that will be taped for later
broadcast as a CBS television special.
   Stevens, 78, formally retired as the first Kennedy Center
chairman on July 1, and was succeeded by former Time Inc. executive
Ralph P. Davidson.
   A wealthy real estate speculator and theatrical producer,
Stevens was appointed chairman of the national cultural center in
1961 and masterminded the financing and construction of the Kennedy
Center, which opened in 1971.
   The center's board of trustees, who approved the 11th annual
Kennedy Center Honors list Thursday, also voted Stevens the title
of founding chairman.

   At least one U.S. city is seeing increased spinal
cord injuries during the summer drought, as swimmers dive into
water that's not as deep as they think it is.
   Two spinal injury centers in Milwaukee reported eight patients
with neck and spinal cord injuries from diving into water June 1 to
July 15, the national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   That was up from three such injuries in the same period last
year and five in the period in 1986, the CDC said.
   This summer's injured were males ages 15 to 23. One was hurt in
a pool, but the other seven were hurt diving into natural bodies of
water; all ``believed the water was deeper than it actually was,''
the CDC said.
   Five of the seven were left with either partial or complete
paralysis in both arms and both legs. The other two suffered
fractures, but no residual neurologic problems.
   ``This summer's drought, affecting most Midwestern and many
Southern states, has resulted in record-low water levels in rivers,
lakes and streams,'' the Atlanta-based CDC noted in its report.
``These conditions probably increase the risk of (spinal cord
injuries) from diving, even in natural bodies of water previously
considered safe.''
   For example, the drought left Wisconsin's inland lakes 10 inches
to 10 feet below normal, the agency said.
   ``Because of extremely low water levels, no one should dive _
even into a familiar body of water _ until the depth of the water
has been objectively measured,'' the CDC warned.
   The CDC reported no current injury figures for the nation or for
other cities. However, 10,000 to 20,000 spinal cord injuries occur
in the United States each year, with as many as 1,000 from diving
accidents, the agency said.
   Several strategies for reducing such injuries have been
suggested, including the posting of warning signs during dry
periods and campaigns to urge divers to check the depth of the
water before diving in _ or at least jump feet first.

   A letter home by a Southern Baptist missionary
denouncing a fellow missionary's beliefs has led to the latter's
dismissal after an unusual intercontinental investigation.
   The case in the nation's largest Protestant denomination had
some peculiar wrinkles, almost like an intelligence service
ferreting out an overseas agent accused of defecting.
   It began with the condemning letter, sent to a hometown
preacher. Copies were circulated. Talk spread.
   Eventually it came before the denomination's Foreign Mission
Board in Richmond, Va. Investigators were sent abroad.
   They interrogated the accused missionary, quizzed associates.
The charges were scattergun. He admitted one _ favoring women's
ordination _ challenged others.
   He was summoned to Richmond, questioned, sent back, then fired.
   The process reflected the stiffened doctrinal grip of
fundamentalists on the 14.7-million-member denomination, although
officials denied partisan pressures, and insisted no purge of
missionaries was going on.
   It upset friends of the missionary, the Rev. Michael E. Willett,
dismissed for ``doctrinal ambiguity.'' He holds a doctorate from
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, where he once
taught.
   ``He's an excellent New Testament scholar,'' says the Rev.
William Link, pastor emeritus of Willett's home church in Liberty,
Mo., who sought in vain to intervene in his behalf.
   ``He's absolutely doctrinally sound. He's being made a
scapegoat.''
   Defending the dismissal, however, the widely respected Rev. R.
Keith Parks, head of the Foreign Mission Board, said the decision
accorded ``with convictions of those of us who had to make it.''
   The board fields about 3,800 foreign missionaries, the largest
professional missions force of any denomination. They're answerable
to the board, on which fundamentalists, or biblical
``inerrantists,'' now hold a majority.
   Parks ``was put in an impossible situation,'' commented the Rev.
Harold Songer, veteran New Testament scholar at the Louisville
seminary. ``He was Custer in Indian country.
   ``He couldn't let a great missionary enterprise be crucified on
a toothpick.''
   The initial letter attacking Willetts' beliefs was written by a
fellow missionary in Costa Rica, the Rev. Mike McGinnis, to a
minister in Birmingham, Ala. As copies circulated, one soon reached
the board.
   Parks sent investigators, including J. Bryan Brasington, to
Costa Rica where both McGinnis and Willett were taking Spanish
courses before assignments in Venezuela. Willett was questioned
extensively.
   He agreed to resign because of objections to his support for
women's ordination, which was discussed. But he refused when
Brasington later wrote that the main charge was Willett's lack of
clarity about Jesus's deity, miracles and physical resurrection.
   Summoned to Richmond, Willett was questioned in a closed
session, from which Link and another supporter were excluded. Then,
with him back in Costa Rica, the board at a July 2l meeting in
Glorieta, N. Mex., fired him.
   Now, ``no missionary will feel safe'' from attack, Willett says.
   In a statement summarizing his beliefs, he affirmed the historic
Christian belief that ``Jesus is God and man, divine and human...In
Jesus of Nazareth, God has reached out to creation to the fullest
extent, as a human being...
   ``Jesus performed miracles through the power of the Holy Spirit,
proclaimed the kingdom of God, died for our sins and was raised by
the power of God. The risen Christ is still present in the world
today, offering salvation to those who place their trust in him.''
   Willett says that Jesus, in his resurrection, ``was transformed
into a new level of existence with God. To say that (Jesus')
spiritual body has flesh and bones like you and I have is to reduce
the resurrection to a resuscitation.''
   About miracles of Jesus, Willett said he accepts most of them,
but questions a few, such as walking on water and changing water
into wine, as possibly expanded or created in the early church.
   Parks ascribed Willett's dismissal to his ``doctrinal
ambiguity,'' particularly about some of Jesus' miracles.
   Songer, a New Testament scholar for 25 years at the
denomination's flagship seminary in Louisville, said Willetts'
statement about miracles ``is a very common view in Biblical
scholarship as a whole.
   ``It's not common among Southern Baptists, but not unheard of.
Some of the older scholars are more inclined to such questioning.
Historically there was more freedom to question openly than there
is now.''
   As for Jesus turning water into wine, Songer said some Baptist
scholars see it as ``allegorical rather than literal,'' signifying
the new joy, spirit and forgiving wine of Christianity. ``But
there's now a new breed of literalists.''
   He described the Willett case as ``symptomatic of a current
mood'' that sees only black or white, no grays, that ``can't allow
any questions, that demands either yes or no, open or closed.''
   Songer called it ``binary thinking,'' adding, ``There's a strong
impact of computer technology in America these days, that
everything is either right or wrong, without compassion or the
grace of forgiveness.
   ``Calculators know no grays.''

<HEAD>FBI Chief Backs Random Drug-Testing of Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William Sessions said Thursday he
strongly favors random drug testing at his agency, despite court
challenges by other federal employees over the issue.
   ``I think random testing has a significant role to play in the
bureau,'' Sessions said at a news conference. ``I think the bureau
must be perceived as being a law-enforcement agency.''
   The FBI does not now randomly test employees for drug use,
although officials have drawn up a plan to initiate such testing in
the future.
   The entire plan has yet to be given final approval by officials
at the Justice Department, the FBI's parent organization, Sessions
said. If approval is granted, random drug testing could begin
within three months.
   Sessions said the FBI's plan would also allow employees to
voluntarily submit to the tests to demonstrate their commitment
against drugs.
   But he said he does not know what effect a court ruling last
week on a Justice Department drug testing program will have on the
FBI's plans.
   U.S. District Court Judge George H. Revercomb blocked the
department for forcing about 1,800 employees in ``sensitive
positions'' from submitting to the random, mandatory urine tests.
Revercomb said the tests could infringe on the constitutional
rights of the employees.
   Forty-two department lawyers have filed suit against the plan.
Two other drug testing cases _ one involving U.S. Customs Service
employees and another involving railroad workers _ are to be heard
by the Supreme Court next week.
   Meantime, the FBI has a program to test new recruits,
probationary employees and those workers suspected of using drugs,
Sessions said. As a result, 13 people who worked at the agency or
had applied for jobs have been terminated, he said.
   In other areas, Sessions said:
   _One FBI agent in each of the bureau's 58 field offices has been
assigned to work with local, state, school and business officials
to educate the public about the dangers of drugs.
   _He will discuss with members of Congress early next month a
report on the FBI's investigation of a group opposed to President
Reagan's Central America policies.
   Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said in February that he
was confident that the FBI did not conduct a massive spying
campaign into the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador. Members of Congress have complained that the
investigation was mishandled.

   The American public will get its first look at
the new Stealth bomber just after the presidential election, and
the plane will make its maiden flight a short time later, the Air
Force said Thursday.
   Maj. Pat Mullaney, an Air Force spokesman, said the Stealth,
designated the B-2, won't fly on the day of its public unveiling in
California, but preparations for flight will be very close to
completion by then. New planes often don't fly until several months
after they are first presented to the public.
   Fred Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, denied Thursday the plane's
unveiling purposely had been set for after the November elections.
   Democratic members of Congress have cautioned the Defense
Department not to make an election-year issue out of the new
bomber, as was done with the B-1B. Both Democrat Michael Dukakis
and Republican George Bush have said they support the new plane.
   The bomber is an unusually short plane because of its unique
``flying wing'' design and will take only two personnel to fly,
reflecting the sophistication of the new technology that has gone
into its development, the service added. The B-52 bomber requires a
crew of six and the new B-1B bomber is flown by a crew of four.
   The Air Force said in a statement the plane would be powered by
four General Electric Co. jet engines. The engine, dubbed the
F-118, will be a derivative of an existing GE powerplant and not
any type of revolutionary new design, the service said.
   The Air Force offered those details about its newest bomber in
announcing that final ``checkout activities'' on the first plane
had begun and that assembly of a second was well along.
   ``The B-2 will roll out in mid-November at Air Force Plant 42 in
Palmdale, Calif,'' the statement said. The exact date was not given.
   The B-2 has been under development for more than a decade under
a shroud of secrecy with Northrop Corp. as the prime contractor.
Thursday's statement was only the second time the Air Force has
disclosed information about the plane. It released an artist's
sketch last April.
   The Stealth bomber takes its nickname from the fact it is
designed to fly without showing up on radar.
   It resembles a ``flying wing'' in shape, without a conventional
fuselage in the center. A small cockpit bubble rises on top of the
flying wing, and inlets for the jet engines are placed to each side
of the cockpit, also on top of the wing.
   The B-2 will stand about 17 feet high, 69 feet long and have a
wingspan of about 172 feet, the service said.
   In addition to GE, subcontractors included the Boeing Advanced
Systems Co., LTV Aircraft Products Group, Hughes Aircraft Radar
System Group and Honeywell.
   The Link Flight Simulation Corp. is responsible for aircrew
training devices and the Boeing Military Airplane Co. will build
the B-2's bomb and missile launcher system, the service added.
   While offering some new information, the Air Force said Thursday
it still was not prepared to publish the current cost estimate for
the Stealth fleet.
   Published reports have suggested overruns have pushed the
pricetag up more than 20 percent to about $450 million per plane.

Aug. 31.
   June 10, 1988 _ The external fuel tank is joined to the solid
rocket boosters, and astronaut Bob Crippen, deputy director of
shuttle operations, says ``we've got a shot'' at meeting the Aug.
31 target. Test firing of shuttle's liquid-fuel engines is set for
July 18.
   July 15, 1988 _ Discovery springs a small gas leak in one
steering engine, and NASA says there is a possibility of additional
delay in the launch, now set for Sept. 3.
   July 22, 1988 _ NASA announces two-day delay in test firing of
main engines, which had been planned for July 30.
   July 29, 1988 _ NASA postpones test firing again, setting date
of Aug. 4, after discovering leak in a hydrogen line during fueling.
   Aug. 1, 1988 _ Another hydrogen leak is detected, but NASA goes
ahead with the countdown rehearsal; no decision on whether to
postpone the test-firing will be made until Aug. 2.
   Aug. 4, 1988 _ The test firing is aborted when a computer
reports a valve problem and shuts down the engines seconds before
they were to ignite.

<HEAD>Senate Confirms Boston Banker as Federal Reserve Board Member</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday confirmed the
nomination of Boston bank executive John P. LaWare as a member of
the Federal Reserve Board.
   The 90-3 vote approving LaWare's selection means that all seven
seats on the board will be held President Reagan's appointees,
which has concerned congressional Democrats.
   Earlier this year, Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of
the Banking Committee, hinted that he might try to delay LaWare's
confirmation hearings so the vacancy could be filled by the next
administration. His panel eventually approved LaWare's nomination.
   On Thursday, Proxmire echoed his party's worries.
   ``We hope and pray that Mr. LaWare and the other members of that
board will recognize the importance of showing their independence
of the fact that they were appointed by the same president,'' he
said.
   At the same time, Proxmire praised LaWare, 60, as ``very, very
well qualified.''
   Senators who opposed LaWare's confirmation were Democrats Kent
Conrad of North Dakota and Albert Gore Jr. and Jim Sasser of
Tennessee.
   Reserve board members are appointed to 14-year terms, and
LaWare's term will not expire until Jan. 31, 2002. The job pays
$82,500 annually.
   LaWare, a banker for 35 years, has been chairman and chief
executive officer of the Shawmut Corp., a bank holding company in
Boston, since 1980.
   He was given a $2.5 million compensation package earlier this
year as part of the merger agreement that created the Shawmut
National Corp., a Boston and Hartford, Conn., bank holding company.
   LaWare was named chairman of the company, and given a deal under
which the corporation will continue his annual salary of about
$500,000 until he is 65, even if he leaves the bank.
   In addition, the bank will give him enough to pay a 20 percent
penalty that Congress imposed on the portions of such arrangements
that are considered excessive.
   During confirmation hearings in July, Proxmire called the
arrangement ``an attempt to dodge the tax code.''
   LaWare responded that ``the tax is being paid, regardless,'' and
that the government is not losing money. ``I'm not sure it's a
dodge,'' he said.
   LaWare has agreed to sever all financial connections with the
bank before joining the Federal Reserve Board.

   A private delegation planning to arrange what
participants believe is the first postwar U.S. medical mission to
Vietnam is on its way to Hanoi.
   The group, headed by plastic surgeon Dr. William Magee, left
Norfolk, Va., on Wednesday and is scheduled to arrive Friday. Magee
heads Operation Smile, which has operated on 2,000 children in
several countries to correct facial deformities.
   Magee said before his departure that the private, nonsectarian
group hopes to meet with Vietnamese officials and discuss an
Operation Smile mission to the country.
   The group recently sent its first delegation to South America,
operating on 160 children of coffee plantation workers in six days
in Colombia, Magee said. Missions are planned later this year to
Kenya and Liberia.
   Several Vietnam veterans are expected to participate in the
Vietnam project, Magee said. He said the trip was being arranged by
U.S. officials who have been dealing with the Vietnamese over the
search for U.S. soldiers missing in action during the Vietnam War.
   Operation Smile has chapters in 10 U.S. cities, including
several high school clubs set up to get youths involved in private
efforts to help people of less-developed countries.

<HEAD>Astronomers Worry About Frivolous Space Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers are worried that commercial
interests will create billboards in the heavens above to increase
profits on the Earth below.
   Star-gazing is best when the skies are dark and pristine, and
astronomers attending the International Astronomical Union assembly
here say their work is being harmed by an increasing number of
satellites crisscrossing overhead.
   Most of the satellites are needed or unavoidable, astronomers
say, but the IAU is battling proposals for such things as orbiting
advertising symbols or works of art, or creating orbiting
cemeteries overhead.
   ``Once we let it get started, the next thing you know there'll
be Golden Arches up there,'' astronomer David Crawford said
Wednesday. ``We have to keep an eagle eye out for this type of
thing.''
   Astronomers are concerned that what Crawford calls ``the
unproductive uses of space'' will block observations of the
universe by ground-based telescopes and possibly damage astronomy
instruments that will be launched into Earth orbit.
   Crawford, a Kitt Peak National Observatory astronomer, and
Sidney van den Bergh, an astronomer for the National Research
Council of Canada, are on an international committee that is
attempting to keep space free of ``frivolous uses.''
   Among the proposals that worry them:
   _A group of artists in France wants to build a kite-like object
the size of a football field and place it in orbit as an art
object. The work of art would be designed to catch and reflect the
sunlight so it could be seen from Earth.
   ``Astronomers are appalled,'' van den Bergh said.
   _Celestis Corp., a Melbourne, Fla., company, wants to orbit a
satellite containing the cremated remains of 10,300 people, thus
using space as sort of a mausoleum in the sky. Plans call for the
satellite to be gold-coated so it would reflect sunlight, enabling
customers to look up and see the remains of their dead relatives
pass overhead.
   ``It would be like building cemeteries in wilderness areas on
Earth,'' Crawford said.
   A plan to create an orbiting salute to the 100th birthday of the
Eiffel Tower already has been canceled. Van den Bergh said the plan
called for launching a ring of 100 lights that would remind people
of the century of the tower.
   ``That would have been the first advertisement in space,'' he
said. ``Once that happens, you don't know where it will stop.''
   Van den Bergh said such uses of space would add to the already
serious light pollution problems astronomers are having in the
study of the stars.
   Astronomers take thousands of star photographs a year. Most
require long exposure times. Satellites orbiting past the field of
view can ruin the pictures and perhaps obscure important
discoveries.
   ``Astronomers are being bothered by this problem much more often
than other people. Already, a third of all the (photo) plates must
be discarded because of satellites,'' van den Bergh said.
   Eventually, though, the crowded orbits of Earth will be a
problem for everybody as more and more uses are found for
spacecraft, he said.
   ``The amount of stuff in Earth orbit now is doubling every
decade,'' said van den Bergh. ``In a century, all operations in
near Earth orbit will be extremely hazardous'' due to the
possibility of collisions.
   Objects in orbit move at about 17,000 miles an hour. At that
velocity, even a dime-sized object can cause great damage in a
collision. Van den Bergh said astronomers are worried about
possible damage from space debris to the $1.5 billion Hubble space
telescope that will be launched next year by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``A piece (of space debris) just an inch across would be enough
to destroy the space telescope if it hits the right place,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Writers Guild Not Ecstatic Over New Pact</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entertainment industry prepared to return
to work Thursday after a 22-week strike, but the Writers Guild of
America expressed some disappointment over its settlement with
television and film producers.
   Hours after the tentative settlement was announced, guild
leaders complained publicly and privately that they had been forced
by the intransigence of the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers to accept a number of contract compromises.
   Representatives for both sides said there can be no winners in a
strike as long as this one, which began March 7 and led to layoffs
throughout Hollywood and put the fall television season in chaos.
   Del Reisman, co-chairman of the WGA negotiating committee,
characterized parts of the settlement announced Wednesday as
``damage control,'' and said the WGA decided Monday that it had to
bring in a deal, and to do so soon.
   Another guild leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
of the contract, ``It was no home run.''
   Nevertheless, guild members are expected to ratify the contract
Sunday. The writers say they can probably start work on a delayed
fall TV season by next week, giving viewers hope of relief from
reruns.
   Guild leaders said they will tell writers at ratification
sessions on both coasts that the terms reflect the best deal
possible under the circumstances.
   ``I'm a little bit more enthused about the deal than others
are,'' said Arthur Sellers, a member of the WGA's negotiating
committee. ``But was it worth it? To me, it's an irrelevant
question. It's like saying `Was World War II worth it?'''
   WGA negotiator Brian Walton said late Wednesday that the
settlement was a ``significant improvement'' over a contract offer
guild members overwhelmingly rejected June 16.
   Yet, in some areas, the new proposal contained just minor
improvements in writers' payments or residuals for television
reruns, considered the strike's key issue.
   But guild leaders said they had changed the way Hollywood does
business and that the producers learned that the writers will not
roll over.
   ``The membership is going to look back at this strike with a
great deal of pride,'' Sellers said. ``The guild's credibility as a
bargaining unit was enhanced. The producers said we wouldn't get a
nickel in foreign residuals. Well, we did. But a nickel is about
all we got.''
   The guild won improvements in creative control over scripts and
the re-acquisition of original screenplays, but gained very little
in payments for television programs rebroadcast overseas.
   ``We wound up with an equation that was actually less than most
of us hoped for,'' Reisman said. ``But it is the first improvement
in 18 years.''
   The new formula links residual payments for television reruns to
the sales of the show, instead of paying a fixed-dollar amount.
   In exchange, the writers can, sometime during the life of the
contract and if the syndication market improves, submit to binding
arbitration a request for a return to the existing fixed payment
residual formula.
   Writers have been getting about $16,000 for a one-hour show.
Under the new system, that could drop to as little as $8,000 for a
show with weak syndication sales or increase to $24,000 for a hit.
The likely amount for the average show is $12,000.
   Writers will be able to choose between two formulas to collect
payments for shows sold to foreign countries: the existing system,
which pays a maximum of about $4,400 for a one-hour show, or a new
plan that would pay 1.2 percent of the producer's foreign sales of
a program as long as it is not less than 85 percent of the current
residual or more than 130 percent of that figure.
   The tentative proposal provides pay boosts of 5 percent in the
first 18 months, 5 percent in the next 18 months and 4.5 percent in
the fourth year of the pact for all compensation under the
agreement. The deal includes the first industry contract for shows
produced for basic cable television.
   The guild has 9,000 members, most in Southern California. The
alliance has 217 member companies responsible for 85 percent of
network prime-time television and 90 percent of feature film
production and distribution.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service said Thursday it
was asking charities for help in reminding contributors that they
can't claim a full tax deduction for a gift if they get something
in return.
   Under IRS rules, for example, a taxpayer claiming a deduction
for the purchase of Girl Scout cookies would have to subtract the
value of the cookies from the amount they paid in order to arrive
at the proper deduction.
   In his notice to 400,000 tax-exempt charities, IRS Commissioner
Lawrence B. Gibbs said he was ``concerned that sponsors of
fund-raising events have often failed to provide written
information'' on deductibility.
   The IRS said the rule applies to fund-raising activities such as
charity balls, bazaars, banquets, auctions, concerts, athletic
events and solicitations for membership or contributions when
merchandise or another benefit is received in return.
   The House Budget Committee last year directed the IRS to monitor
the efforts of charity groups to inform contributors.

<TEXT>
   Railroad workers walked off their jobs Thursday,
after the morning rush hour was over, to protest massive layoffs by
management and then returned a few hours later, in time for the
evening rush, after Congress intervened.
   ``It's over and we're ready to try to find an agreement,'' said
Fred Bloedorn, spokesman for Chicago & North Western Transportation
Co.
   Under terms of the congressional action, the railroad reinstated
1,156 brakemen's jobs it says are unnecessary. The railroad said
those positions would be secure until the end of a 36-day
cooling-off period or in the event of a settlement to the
longstanding dispute.
   The company and union said they expected quick presidential
approval of the congressional measure and declared the strike over
without waiting for the formality. President Reagan later signed it
into law at about 1:30 EDT, said Rep. Terry Bruce, who attended the
bill-signing at the White House.
   Bruce and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., both negotiated a compromise
that delayed the strike _ originally scheduled for shortly after
midnight _ until after the morning rush-hour.
   Delaying the walkout spared 41,000 commuters the incovenience of
having to find another way to work.
   During the cooling-off period, the union may not strike and the
company cannot eliminate jobs, said Bruce.
   The dispute centers on a C&NW plan to adopt new work rules
cutting the size of most of its train crews from four to two
workers, a move the union vigorously opposes.
   United Transportation Union President Fred Hardin said he was
optimistic a settlement to the dispute could be reached before
Sept. 9, when the cooling-off period ends.
   ``I think it can be if both parties will negotiate in good
faith,'' Hardin said.
   In addition to its commuter services, the railroad moves freight
on 6,400 miles of track in 10 Midwestern states. The strike by
2,600 UTU members would have snarled freight traffic in those
states and likely would have idled 7,500 unionized C&NW workers.
   All of the UTU workers for C&NW walked out, except for the
operators of commuter and freight trains that were in transit when
the strike was declared, Bloedorn said.
   Just two hours later, members of the House of Representatives
unanimously approved a measure delaying the strike until Sept. 9,
said David Carle, a spokesman for Simon.
   The House acted quickly to avoid disruption of service to
Chicago-area commuters, said Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's transportation
subcommitte.
   ``Moreover, the loss of rail service in parts of the Midwest
will cause significant hardships for farmers trying to get their
grain to market in these very difficult times,'' he said.
   Union workers briefly picketed C&NW's downtown Chicago terminal,
but some with reluctance.
   ``It's taken up way too much time for for both parties,'' said
Michael Boykin, 35, a freight foreman and 14-year veteran of the
company. ``If they'd really wanted to, both parties could have
reached an amicable agreement.''

   Iranian gunboats fired machine guns at a
Norwegian supertanker Thursday, shipping executives said, in the
first reported shooting incident in the Persian Gulf since Iran
agreed to negotiate a truce with Iraq.
   But Iran quickly denied involvement in the ship raid, instead
saying it was probably the work of those who are opposed to peace
in the region. No injuries were reported.
   Iran said another 1,000 civilians were injured in Iraqi chemical
bomb raids, raising the number to 2,700 in two days, and it urged
the United Nations Security Council to condemn such attacks.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, meanwhile, said without
elaborating that Iraqi warplanes raided two Iranian oil pumping
facilities.
   At the United Nations on Thursday, Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and Security Council members tried to break a
deadlock over a cease-fire resolution Iran and Iraq have accepted.
The talks have bogged down over Iraq's demand for direct talks with
Iran before the cease-fire is set.
   Also Thursday, a leader of the rebels fighting Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's rule was publicly hanged in Iran and another
surrendered to government forces, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency said.
   The report said the executed man was a leader of the Mujahedeen
Khalq or People's Holy Warriors, an Iraqi-backed rebel group. The
prisoner was identified by the news agency only as a rebel
commander.
   Gulf-based shipping executives said the tanker attack appeared
to be an isolated one and did not mean a resurgence in the gulf's
``tanker war.'' The executives, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Iranian gunboats opened fire after the tanker, the
Berge Lord, defied demands to stop for inspection.
   No injuries and only minor damage was reported aboard the
284,502-ton Berge Lord, which continued out of the gulf with a
cargo of Saudi Arabian crude oil.
   The encounter, involving an estimated six Iranian gunboats,
occurred near Abu Musa island in the southern gulf, a base for
Iran's speedboats.
   In an unusual move, Iran quickly disavowed the shooting and
suggested that any such attack would be designed to undermine the
current U.N. peace effort.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said an unidentified military
official at general command headquarters ``refuted reports that
Iranian gunboats had attacked a Norwegian tanker in the Persian
Gulf.''
   IRNA quoted the official as saying Iranian gunboats ``have never
had and do not have such missions,'' and ``probably the attack, if
it really took place, has been carried out by those who are against
a stable peace in the region and are hampering implementation of
U.N. Resolution 598.''
   Iran never has officially acknowledged its gunboat raids on
neutral shipping in the gulf, and veteran observers could not
recall a previous denial.
   Some gulf shipping executives said the Iranians apparently fired
only ``warning shots'' at the Norwegian tanker, which was the
victim of an Iranian gunboat attack in the Strait of Hormuz in
March.
   The ship's master sent a ``mayday'' distress call. It prompted
immediate fears that the ``tanker war,'' in which more than 500
ships have been damaged and 350 seamen killed in the past eight
years, had resumed.
   Iran announced July 18 it would accept a U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iraq. Since then, Iraq, which
accepted the resolution when it was adopted a year ago, has not
conducted air raids on Iranian oil tankers. Iran also has refrained
from attacking commercial tankers during that time.
   Iran, however, has continued to stop and inspect neutral ships
in the southern gulf, in search of Iraq-related cargo. Such
activity by a belligerent is legal under international maritime law.
   Also Thursday, Iran said that 1,700 civilians were now reported
injured in an Iraqi chemical bomb attack Tuesday in the town of
Oshnaviyeh in the northern province of West Azerbaijan. In another
attack Wednesday on villages west of Oshnaviyeh, another 1,000
villagers were injured, the agency reported.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said in letter to Perez de
Cuellar that his government ``urgently requests unequivocal
condemnation of this heinous Iraqi act of aggression by the
Security Council.''

<HEAD>Envoy Says Noriega May Want Talks With Deposed President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian Ambassador Juan Sosa said Thursday
there are indications military ruler Gen. Manuel Noriega may want
to negotiate with ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle to whom
Sosa is loyal.
   The ambassador said Delvalle, who has been in hiding in Panama,
has received a written message from Noriega but ``no negotiations
are under way.''
   Sosa said Delvalle, whom the Reagan administration recognizes as
president of Panama, has always been willing to negotiate for a
return of democracy to Panama.
   He said he did not believe Delvalle has met with a Noriega
emissary as reported in Thursday's editions of The Miami Herald.
The newspaper quoted sources close to Delvalle and quoted former
Noriega aide Jose Blandon as saying the ousted president was
preparing a document on his willingness to negotiate.
   Sosa said in a telephone interview that Noriega sent a proposal
for a dialogue last month, shortly before Delvalle slipped
temporarily into Miami for a medical checkup.
   Sosa said the embassy in Washington has had no contact with
Noriega's government in Panama City and maintains itself with funds
withheld from Noriega. Sosa said he has a staff of five other
diplomats, a receptionist and a chauffeur.
   Roberto Leyton, the Panamanian ambassador to the Organization of
American States here, is loyal to Noriega.
   Delvalle dismissed Noriega as defense chief Feb. 25, but was
ousted the following day by the Noriega-dominated National Assembly.

Danger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negative preoccupation with mental health
treatment could hurt the nation by discouraging public officials
who need help from seeking it, an official of the American
Psychological Association said Thursday.
   ``It makes it impossible for key decision-makers, including the
president whose finger is on the nuclear trigger, to receive
appropriate and preventive psychological care at times of personal
crisis,'' Dr. Bryant L. Welch told a news conference.
   The issue was thrust into the spotlight this week by rumors,
originating with associates of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche,
that Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis had
undergone treatment for depression.
   That has been denied by Dukakis and his personal physician. And
President Reagan said he shouldn't have made a joking comment
Wednesday that Dukakis was ``an invalid.''
   ``All people, including elected officials, no matter how
healthy, are psychologically unstable during times of personal
crisis. These crises can involve the loss of a loved one, a serious
physical illness, or other traumatic event,'' said Welch, the APA's
executive director for professional practice.
   Professional treatment can help people through those events, and
seeking such treatment is not an indication of any underlying
mental illness, Welch said.
   ``Unfortunately, in the current climate there is no question
that (public officials) are being discouraged from seeking
psychological care for fear the very fact of seeking care will
subject them to being labeled `mentally ill' and unfit for public
service,'' Welch said.
   Whether an individual can stand up under pressure is a
legitimate question, Welch said, ``but I don't think having had
psychological care is a good predictor of that.''
   Past presidents have suffered from serious bouts of depression,
notably Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Jackson, Welch said.
   He also expressed concern about the insistence on candidates
releasing raw medical records, commenting that such information
could be subject to misunderstanding and political demagoguery.
   Information on physical and mental condition is important for
voters, he said, but should be explained by physicians rather than
simply making medical records public.
   Asked if merely talking with a friend in times of stress
constitutes treatment, Welch said that could be beneficial, but he
would not consider it to be ``treatment.''
   ``I'm not saying one should always see a mental health
specialist every time they undergo a life crisis,'' he said.

   A computer spotted a valve problem
and scrubbed NASA's test firing of space shuttle Discovery's
engines in the final second Thursday, dealing another setback to
America's 2{-year effort to return to space.
   Engineers said it will be three to seven days before they can
try the test again. The postponement was the fifth in two weeks and
made it almost certain that Discovery's flight will be delayed from
late September into October.
   ``That's why we have flight readiness firings, to work the bugs
out of equipment before we launch,'' said James Fletcher, the
administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   No American has been launched into space since the shuttle
Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, killing
seven crew members.
   The problem Thursday either was a valve that didn't close as
fast as it was supposed to or a sensor that gave a wrong reading of
the valve's open-closed position.
   ``We don't know whether it was a faulty indication or really a
malfunction in the valve,'' said Joseph A. Lombardo, engine program
director at NASA's propulsion facility in Mississippi.
   Engineers were looking at the possibility that the sensor might
have been affected by long exposure to the extreme cold of the
liquid hydrogen fuel. The tanks were loaded for 10 hours, four
hours longer than normal, so that special tests could be run on the
fuel system.
   To remain liquid, hydrogen must be kept at 423 degrees below
zero.
   Boyce Mix, engine manager at NASA's Mississippi engine test
facility, said historically some sensors are more
temperature-sensitive than others.
   As the tanks were being drained, he said, the valve was tested
and it worked sluggishly the first time but normally after it
warmed up.
   The computer, which controls all operations in the final 31
seconds of a launch countdown, received an indication that the
valve still was partially open, which would allow high-pressure
gases to enter areas unable to accommodate them, possibly causing a
rupture and explosion. The computer reacted as it was supposed to.
   ``The actual start commands to the engine were never given,''
Lombardo said. ``The incident that occurred was not that we had a
start failure of the main engines but that we had a failure to
start.''
   If the sensor is at fault, Lombardo said, a change in computer
commands might be a way around the problem. Swapping out the sensor
and the valve could take three days to a week, said John J. Talone,
who manages scheduling for Discovery.
   ``We just don't have all the answers this early,'' Lombardo said.
   The valve operated perfectly in earlier tests but ``sluggishness
is what we determined today,'' he said.
   During the test, the shuttle is secured to the pad by bolts
three inches in diameter and three feet long. The two solid booster
rockets that flank the orbiter and the huge fuel tank are not fired
in the test.
   If all had gone well, the shuttle's three main engines should
have fired for 20 seconds _ the major test before committing a
shuttle to flight. Two of the engines _ including the one with the
valve problem _ had not flown before. The third had been used on
four missions.
   At least two days is required to drain more than a half-million
gallons of fuel from the shuttle tank and to refill them. But
Talone said an extra day was added to the minimum time to give
crews a rest.
   In the past two weeks, officials had made four other attempts to
prepare the shuttle for the flight readiness test. All failed
because of faults in the ground servicing equipment.
   NASA had hoped to launch Discovery in late September, but even
before the test abort, many officials believed the launch would
slip into October because of earlier delays and an unresolved gas
leak in a steering engine system that is separate from the main
engines.
   Launch director Bob Sieck has said each day of delay in the
firing test would move back the launch by one day.
   Among the disappointed observers Thursday were two of the five
astronauts slated to fly Discovery, Navy Capt. Rick Hauck and
Marine Lt. Col. Dave Hilmers.
   ``Although we were disappointed today's test did not go full
term, we were impressed with the professional manner in which the
launch team responded to the situation,'' Hauck said, in a
statement distributed by NASA.
   The shuttle program also must pass another key propulsion test
before Discovery is OK'd for flight: a full-scale firing, the fifth
in a series, of the redesigned solid fuel booster rocket at the
Morton Thiokol plant in Utah. It is scheduled for Aug. 20.

   Troops moved into Rangoon on Thursday
to stop thousands of masked teen-agers from demonstrating in
defiance of the Burmese government's martial law decree, diplomats
and returning tourists reported.
   Heavy monsoon rains lashed the crowds. Soldiers fired warning
shots but no violence was reported.
   Diplomats in Rengoon described the demonstrations as the largest
against the military-dominated regime since student riots earlier
this year.
   ``Both the students and military seem to be trying to avoid
confrontation, but the situation is fluid, tense and dangerous,''
one diplomat said.
   Protesters, most of them high school students, shouted demands
for democracy, the ouster of President Sein Lwin and freedom for
dissidents the former general has jailed since assuming power last
week. He declared martial law Wednesday after students held
peaceful street demonstrations.
   Separate large protests began simultaneously at midday Thursday,
the diplomats reported, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   They said the total number of protesters was not known but about
10,000 gathered at the Sule Pagoda in the heart Rangoon and
soldiers fired warning volleys into the air. Most in the crowd were
youngsters with their faces covered so authorities could not
identify them, according to the diplomats.
   West European tourists interviewed after arrival in Bangkok said
they saw armored personnel carriers and jeeps armed with machine
guns cruising the streets. Soldiers guarded the city hall, National
Assembly building and other sites.
   Reports from diplomats said the heavy rain thinned some crowds,
but by late afternoon a throng had gathered at Rangoon University,
a center of protest four miles north of the city. They said about
25 truckloads of soldiers were at the campus.
   Italian tourist Otta Violavaggi said about half the stores in
downtown Rangoon closed after Wednesday's demonstrations, which
authorities said led them to declaring martial law in the city of
3.5 million.
   ``Everybody was very anxious. Nobody knows what to do,'' said
Christine Jacobs of Brussels, Belgium. Tourists said they were told
they would be arrested if they took photographs.
   Several Burmese said a general strike would be held Monday, the
tourists said, quoting the informants as saying the date was chosen
because eight is an auspicious number and Monday is the eighth day
of the eighth month of 1988.
   Other Rangoon residents reached by telephone said protesters
dispersed after several trucks full of soldiers arrived at a
government office building near the Sule Pagoda, a shrine said to
be more than 2,000 years old and believed to house relics of the
Lord Buddha.
   Crowds gathered around the colonial-style red brick office
building and shouted anti-government slogans.
   Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, said after martial law was
declared Wednesday that it was necessary to maintain security,
safeguard property and allow students who so desire to study
peacefully. It said directives might be issued for summary trials.
   The diplomats said there was no curfew, but few residents were
seen on the streets after the martial law decree. Tourists said it
was hard to get a restaurant meal Wednesday night.
   Sein Lwin, 64, was elected president of Burma and chairman of
the ruling Socialist Program Party last week, replacing Ne Win, who
stepped down after ruling Burma for 26 years. Pamphlets circulated
in Rangoon call him a ruthless oppressor who must be overthrown.
   Since Sein Lwin assumed power authorities have arrested several
dissidents and others, including the country's most respected and
vocal critic of the system, Aung Gyi, and Associated Press
correspondent Sein Win. They have been accused of ``attacking the
state.''
   Foreign journalists have followed developments by telephone and
by monitoring official media because of restrictions on their entry
to Rangoon, the only legal gateway to Burma for most outsiders.
Foreign reporters usually entered the country in the past on
tourist visas issued at Burmese embassies.

   These are supposed to be the dog days of the
presidential campaign, when the candidates rest between conventions
and the voters vacation. But in this summer's record heat, the 1988
race is turning mean.
   A month before the traditional Labor Day kick-off for the fall
campaign, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has
already taken a hard shot: The news was filled with stories about
rumors that he did _ or didn't _ have psychiatric treatment.
   This was more than just the usual jabbing at your opponent that
is part and parcel of the political wars.
   It was a nasty trick, an effort to raise doubts about the
stability and sanity of a presidential candidate _ without a single
fact to back up the rumors.
   The Democratic presidential nominee and his doctor firmly denied
the rumors on Wednesday, and now the Democrats are pointing the
finger at the Republicans as the ultimate source.
   ``There's something significant about what the Republicans have
done here,'' said New York Gov. Mario Cuomo on Thursday, ``the fact
that they would use Lyndon LaRouche to get this thing started, the
fact that they would get negative, that they would get so
irrelevant so early.''
   Democratic Party chief Paul Kirk said the Republicans are
practicing ``the politics of desperation.''
   ``If there's been any negative campaigning, it's coming from one
side,'' he said Thursday. ``They have nothing positive to say about
the future.''
   The only fingerprints on the rumors are those of LaRouche, a
political extremist, whose supporters have handed out fliers
spreading the Dukakis rumors. But other news organizations have
reported hearing the same sort of talk from Republican sources and
even from White House officials.
   And President Reagan's fingerprints are on the making of the
rumors into news.
   Asked by a LaRouche supporter about the matter, Reagan made a
crack Wednesday about Dukakis as ``an invalid.'' Then he said he
shouldn't have said that, that his joke had fallen flat.
   But what he had said had been enough. The president had dealt
with the issue in front of the cameras, and Dukakis felt he had to
step forward and deny the rumors personally.
   Now the question is: Will the mud-slinging continue or will the
tone of the campaign improve dramatically.
   Bush and his fellow Republicans have the major opportunity in
the next two weeks to set the tone. The indications are their
message will be a tough one.
   His campaign officials have outlined a program through the
Republican convention of sharp attacks on Dukakis and his record.
   Thursday's theme was defense and Bush himself said Dukakis is
for ``unilateral disarmament,'' a favorite charge aimed at painting
a liberal as weak on defense.
   Former presidential hopeful Jack Kemp added his blast in a
Chicago speech, saying Dukakis is ``not a Kennedy Democrat. He is a
liberal Democrat of the McGovern era.''
   These attacks are to continue, with Reagan playing a role in his
appearence on the opening night of the GOP convention in New
Orleans.
   That strategy can hurt Dukakis, said pollster Andrew Kohut of
the Gallup Organization.
   ``They can use the dreaded `L' word,'' Kohut said. ``They can
make Dukakis out to be a liberal.''
   But there are dangers for the Republicans in this strategy.
   One is that voters will find it all too negative and too boring.
   The Democrats tried to avoid that danger at their Atlanta
convention by using humor, making fun of Bush with Sen. Edward
Kennedy asking ``Where was George?'' and keynote speaker Ann
Richards talking about Bsh's being born with ``a silver foot in his
mouth.''
   The other danger is that the American people would never get a
chance to hear the positives about Bush, amid all the
Dukakis-bashing.
   Democratic chief Kirk said Bush has been ``running against the
1970s and trying to apply labels to Governor Dukakis that have no
bearing. ... I haven't heard any ... dialogue about where we go,
about the future of this country.''
   Pollster Kohut said the Republicans have to spend more time
talking about Bush's positives than about Dukakis' negatives. Bush
is widely recognized by the public, but poll after poll has shown
that the voters don't really know much about him.
   The Republican convention _ and Bush's acceptance speech in
particular _ are prime opportunities for Bush to introduce himself
to America and to put forward a positive vision for the country.
   ``He has to do exactly what Dukakis did,'' Kohut said. ``He has
to make himself more human. ... The voters want a leader and a
human being.''
   In Atlanta, Dukakis didn't do any Bush-bashing in his acceptance
speech, taking the time to lay out his own themes and his own ideas
for the nation.
   Cuomo, in poking fun at Bush, made the point clearly that the
Republican nominee has a case to make.
   ``He's a nice man. He's a good American. But there's no
rationale for George Bush,'' said Cuomo. ``There is no case for
George Bush. ... He was a terrific first baseman for Yale. He's
tall. ...''
   In the meantime, the tone of campaign '88 has turned sharp and
sour, perhaps signaling a long and difficult fall to come.

   Success was within the grasp of the
tired group of space shuttle launch controllers. They had been
frustrated by two less-than-successful practice counts in a week,
and now they were seconds away from a vital test firing of shuttle
Discovery's engines.
   ``8...7...6...5...,'' the clock ticked away. Then stopped.
   A computer had sensed a problem with an engine valve Thursday
and withheld an ignition signal. The test was put off at least
three days.
   Just a month ago, on July 4, the workers at the Kennedy Space
Center had been energized when at long last, after months of delay,
Discovery was transported to the launch pad.
   Several thousand turned out at midnight to cheer Discovery as it
moved in the glare of spotlights. Nearly 20,000, including
families, took advantage of a rare open house to drive their cars
past the launch pad later that day to proudly view the shuttle
sitting majestically on Launch Pad 39B.
   This is what we're here for, they said. To launch vehicles into
space. Now, 2{ years after the Challenger disaster and the death of
its seven astronauts, they had a shuttle on the pad. The launch was
set for early September.
   Since then, it's been one disappointment after another.
   On July 15, engineers detected a small leak in a gas line in a
steering engine compartment. Engineers came up with a scheme to
reach the offending fitting but that would mean about a two-week
launch postponement.
   They would do the repair after the main engines were test fired.
   But before that countdown could begin, they had to conduct a
practice count in which Discovery's external fuel tank was to be
filled with half a million gallons of propellant.
   Fueling began last Friday, but was quickly scrubbed because of a
hydrogen leak in ground support equipment. The leak was fixed and
another count begun on Sunday. Another hydrogen leak cropped up.
NASA decided to complete the test, skipping several planned fuel
tests, with a partial load.
   The countdown was completed, but technicians could not find the
leak. So they changed all the seals and fittings in the suspect
area.
   On Wednesday night, the count resumed for the test firing,
considered critical for certifying Discovery for flight.
   All night long, the count was perfect. Fueling was completed on
time. There were no leaks, and the team was well ahead of schedule.
   Then the bitter disappointment when the valve closed too slowly
or a sensor gave a wrong reading and the computer called a halt.
   It appeared almost certain the launch would slip into October.
   Has the morale of the launch team been shattered?
   ``To tell you the truth, these are professional people,'' said
John Talone, Discovery's schedule flow director. ``There is a
certain amount of frustration because we thrive on doing these
things completely and getting them done. When things don't work as
well, it's just a challenge. But they're ready to come back
tomorrow and I don't see any morale effect of it.''

   The groans of a beaten U.S. drug agent and
his pleas for his family's safety were heard in federal court
Thursday as prosecutors played tapes of the slain agent's
interrogation by his abductors.
   At one point, Enrique Camarena is heard asking if he can bandage
his broken ribs. The request is ignored.
   ``With the beating you have given me ... do you think that I am
going to lie to you?'' Camarena asks at one point.
   The tapes, which run nearly two hours, depict an apparently
exhausted Camarena answering questions in a monotone, disclosing
confidential Drug Enforcement Administration information in an
effort to safe his life.
   ``Don't hit me any more,'' Camarena declares several times.
   ``No,'' the interrogator replies calmly. ``No one will hit you.''
   But later in the tape, Camarena is heard moaning in pain.
   The actual torture the prosecution says he endured was not on
the recordings.
   Camarena was abducted in Guadalajara on Feb. 7, 1985, as he was
leaving the American consulate to have lunch with his wife. His
body and that of his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were found
buried at a remote ranch in Mexico several weeks later. They had
been severely beaten and Camarena's skull was shattered.
   Three Mexican nationals are on trial in the crimes which the
government claims were orchestrated by Mexican drug kingpin Rafael
Caro Quintero, 33, who is imprisoned in Mexico. He and two other
men are being tried for the crimes there.
   In testimony following the playing of the tapes, DEA agent Dale
Stinson identified the voices of Camarena's interrogators as Caro
and Sergio Espinosa Verdin, a former Mexican federal police
commander.
   Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, and Raul Lopez Alvarez, 28, are
charged with the murders of Camarena and Zavala. Also charged is
Jesus Felix Gutierrez, 38, who allegedly helped Caro escape in
Mexico after the killing.
   Only one defendant, Verdugo, was mentioned in passing on the
tapes, which prosecutors say were made at an estate in Guadalajara.
   The muffled tapes were played in a darkened courtroom with
jurors watching a transcript of the words projected on a screen.
   Most of the interrogation focused on the identity of DEA
informants in Mexico. Camarena named two and gave information on
where they lived. He also gave directions to the home of another
DEA agent in Mexico.
   ``I am saying this to you because, well, don't hurt my family
please,'' Camarena is heard saying in a quiet voice.
   ``No one is going to hurt your family. Forget about that,'' says
the interrogator. ``They are not to blame for anything. ... You
just keep on remembering, that is all. ... I am not going to hit
you or anything. OK?''
   Large portions of the tapes center on the interrogators' efforts
to find out how much Camarena knew about Caro. Camarena claimed he
knew little, that he couldn't find out where Caro lived and was
hampered because American agents were not allowed to carry firearms
in Mexico.
   At that, the interrogator snapped, ``Don't tell me about your
problems, speak of the information you can give us, you can provide
us to finish with this bunch of jerks.''
   ``Yes, sir,'' Camarena said in a weak voice. ``What more can I
tell you sir?''
   Toward the end of the tape, Camarena is heard moaning and crying
out in pain.
   ``I am not going to hit you,'' the interrogator assures him.
   ``No, it was that I am getting sharp pains,'' says the agent,
who is ignored.
   ``Couldn't I ask you to have my ribs bandaged, please?''
Camarena asks. That too is ignored.

   Banks reopened, stock values
climbed and interest rates fell Thursday in a positive reaction by
financial markets to the government's economic austerity plan.
   President Raul Alfonsin and other officials unveiled the plan
late Wednesday. It is intended to curtail triple-digit inflation,
one of the highest foreign debts in the developing world and a
crippling budget deficit.
   People lined up at banks and foreign exchange houses that were
open fo the first time this week. The government ordered Sunday
that they remain closed while it completed the austerity plan.
   Samuel Glembubogki, executive director of the Federation of
Cooperative Banks, said withdrawals, which signal lack of
confidence, were ``very, very small. The tendency has been to
maintain deposits.''
   Monthly interest rates on loans declined to about 15 percent by
the end of Thursday's business day. A week ago they were 25 percent
and higher.
   The average value of shares on the Stock Exchange rose by 20
percent as investors shifted their money out of bonds and foreign
currencies. The austral, Argentina's currency, traded at a better
rate than the 14.4 to the dollar tentatively set Wednesday night by
Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille.
   Also included in the economic program are cuts in government
spending and voluntary voluntary price controls.
   Argentina's 31 million people have suffered years of inflation.
The cost of living for the first seven months of 1988 rose nearly
150 percent, the current budget has a $3.5 billion deficit and the
$56 billion foreign debt is the third highest among developing
countries.

   Michael Dukakis campaigned in rural
Mississippi on Thursday and said his promise of economi change
would deliver opportunity to all, ``no matter who they are or where
they come from or what the color of their skin.''
   Visiting near one of the civil rights battlegrounds of the
1960s, the Democratic presidential nominee made only brief
reference to that struggle for equality for blacks.
   But he did say, ``Here in Mississippi, you know the importance
of equal rights and civil rights. Today I say to all Americans _
not just in Neshoba County but all over America _ we've got to work
together, we've got to work together to bring down the barriers to
opportunity for all our people.''
   Dukakis spoke to a noontime crowd at the Neshoba County Fair,
where a crowd filled a grandstand and many more sat in lounge
chairs on the red dirt of a horse track in front of the covered
podium. The mostly white audience was estimated at 6,000 to 7,000
people by Sheriff Glen Waddell.
   The appearance was loaded with symbolism, as the Neshoba fair
was the place where Ronald Reagan kicked off his campaign as the
Republican presidential nominee eight years ago, nearly to the day.
Dukakis has directed much of his campaign efforts since winning the
nomination at attracting the support of independent and Democratic
voters who supported Reagan in the past two elections.
   At the same time, he was campaigning in a state where he lost
the Democratic primary to Jesse Jackson.
   The rural region of east-central Mississippi was the scene of
one of the dark incidents of the civil rights struggle: the 1964
slaying of three civil rights workers, an episode that Jackson
frequently recalled in his campaign speeches.
   Dukakis didn't note in his remarks that the three men's bodies
were found 24 years ago Thursday. Asked about that later, he said,
``I talked about economic opportunity because that's the most
important single thing that concerns people.''
   Mississippi was the first stop on a three-day campaign trip that
followed a day in Boston spent dealing with news accounts about
rumors that Dukakis had undergone psychiatric treatment. No
substantiation for the rumors has been presented, and Dukakis and
his doctor said Wednesday he had never undergone psychiatric
treatment or counseling of any kind.
   Dukakis received a friendly greeting from the hot and dusty
crowd, although some in the audience waved signs supporting
Republican George Bush. One sign said, ``Liberal Go Home.''
   In his 1980 visit, Reagan declared his support for ``states'
rights'' and a restoration of powers to state and local governments.
   Dukakis, in his remarks, made no reference to Reagan.
   He repeated his broad calls for investment in schools and
industrial revitalization to produce more and better jobs. He
referred to Mississippi as ``a state that's hurting.''
   ``We can settle for what Lloyd Bentsen calls a Swiss cheese
economy,'' Dukakis said, using his running mate's term to describe
a nation marked by pockets of economic hard times.
   ``Or, we can go to work and build an economic future for this
country that will create good jobs at good wages for every citizen
in this land, no matter who they are or where they come from or
what the color of their skin,'' Dukakis said.
   ``We have to work together to see that every citizen and every
child born in this country is an equal shareholder in the American
dream,'' he said.
   Appearing with Dukakis were local officials including Democratic
Gov. Ray Mabus, who was elected last year.
   Dukakis also cited Democratic Sen. John Stennis, who has held
his seat for 40 years, and said, ``You can't tell me that
Mississippi isn't going to vote for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen
this fall.''
   Dukakis repeated his criticism of the mililtary contracts
scandal, saying, ``We're going to throw the dishonest contractors
and the wheeler dealers out of the Pentagon once and for all.''
   Dukakis met with local elected officials and some former
supporters of Jackson aboard a bus during the hour-long ride from
the Meridian airport to the fairgrounds outside Philadelphia.
   His visit to Mississippi was the first stop on a hurried
campaign swing that takes him to the West Coast and back to Boston
in three days. Aides said much of the trip would be devoted to
stressing the themes of protecting the environment and fragile
coastal areas, highlighted by a scheduled appearance just off the
Pacific Coast Highway at Laguna Beach, Calif.

   The government got a letter Thursday
from kidnapped West German businessman Rudolf Cordes and a panel
monitoring the hostage situation in Lebanon met to discuss it.
   Two other letters from Cordes were delivered to his family
Wednesday. He was abducted in Beirut, Lebanon, on Jan. 17, 1987.
   The West German-Algerian man who delivered the three letters
said he believed Cordes would be freed soon.
   ``The chances look genuinely good,'' said Abdel-Kadar Sahraoui
in an interview with the ZDF television network.
   Government sources confirmed privately that Sahraoui, identified
as a middleman by news media, delivered the letters but they
refused to give details.
   Federal government spokesman Norbert Schaefer announced Thursday
night that the third letter was received and said the government
and family were convinced the letters were authentic.
   ``The government and Cordes' family have received signs that he
is alive through these three letters,'' Schaefer said.
   He said a special panel of government security officials
monitoring the hostage situation in Lebanon met for an hour to
discuss the letters.
   He would not reveal the contents of the letters or details of
the meeting.
   In the ZDF interview, Sahraoui did not say whether he met
personally with Cordes' captors.
   He said Cordes is being treated by a doctor, but that ``his life
is not in danger.'' Earlier West German news reports said Cordes
was ill.
   Days after Shiite Moslem radicals kidnapped Cordes in Beirut,
another West German businessman, Alfred Schmidt, was also kidnapped
in the Lebanese capital.
   Schmidt's kidnappers freed him last September in what they
called a ``goodwill gesture.''
   Last April, a court in Duesseldorf convicted Abbas Hamadi of
masterminding the two abductions in a bid to force West Germany to
free his brother, Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   Mohammed Hamadi now is on trial in Frankfurt, charged with air
piracy and murder in a 1985 TWA hijacking in which U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem was killed.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Thursday that 82 elite ``blue
beret'' paratroopers were arrested for going on a drunken rampage
after a celebration of a military holiday.
   Moscow police stations resembled a ``war front'' as officers
brought the drunken soldiers in Tuesday night, said the report in
Moskovsky Komsomolyets, published by the Moscow Young Communist
League.
   It was among the worst cases of misconduct by soldiers printed
in the Soviet media and indicates the military is not above
criticism in the atmosphere of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effort to
open Soviet society.
   The newspaper said the trouble began Tuesday at Moscow's
riverside Gorky Park, where up to 50,000 people had gathered, a
third of them former paratroopers.
   ``Young fellows in blue berets went on a spree,'' it said.
``They conducted themselves outrageously during the holiday.''
   After festivities in the park, many drunken soldiers started
causing trouble in the streets.
   Groups of up to 60 entered cafes demanding vodka. A fight
involving 40 people began in one cafe and spilled into the street,
the report said.
   Seven paratroopers were arrested for beating a passerby, who
suffered a brain concussion, it said.
   Police repeatedly warned rowdy paratroopers but they did not
stop and 82 finally were taken to police stations, Moskovsky
Komsomolyets reported.
   It did not say what charges they faced or give any other details
of criminal proceedings.

<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wall Street credit rating firm suspended
the city's bond rating Thursday, crippling the city's borrowing
power on the third day of fines imposed when City Council rejected
a housing desegregation plan.
   ``We can't borrow money,'' interim City Manager Neil DeLuca said
after Moody's Investors Service Inc. suspended its rating of
Yonkers' bonds. ``No corporation can function without the ability
to borrow money.''
   A federal judge began fining the city Tuesday after City Council
failed to support his plan to build low- and middle income housing
to remedy housing and school segregation.
   The fines began at $100 on Tuesday and double each day.
   In a statement, Moody's said the suspension was ``due to
uncertainties resulting from daily fines imposed by the federal
court. Those uncertainties derive foremost from the potential for
extraordinary disruption of operations.''
   Moody's said the fine schedule would deplete the city's reported
Aug. 3 cash reserve of $66.3 million by Aug. 22.
   Another credit rating firm, Standard & Poor's Corp. said it was
monitoring the situation Thursday and took no action on its
Yonkers' rating.
   Yonkers, the state's fourth-largest municipality with a
population of nearly 200,000, has been in a legal tug-of-war with
U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand since 1985, when he found the city
liable for intentionally segregating housing and schools during a
40-year period. Yonkers is just north of New York City.
   City Council on Monday voted 4-3 against endorsing a package of
bonuses, financial incentives and zoning variances to attract
developers to build the housing.
   ``Everybody seems to be doing the same thing, waiting for the
other guy to move,'' DeLuca said. ``The judge, the council, the
governor, the control board. ... We can't get the City Council to
change its vote and we can't get the judge to change his ruling and
we're going bankrupt.''
   The judge has suggested that Gov. Mario Cuomo step in to help
resolve the crisis, either by removing the four councilmen who
voted against the judge's plan or through the state-run Emergency
Financial Control Board, which oversees city spending. The four
councilmen are paying daily fines of $500.
   The control board, however, postponed a meeting slated for
Thursday and Cuomo said he was reluctant to get involved.
   The governor said, ``I'm not going to allow any damage to occur
that I can prevent.'' But he told New York radio station WCBS-AM
that action ``has to be taken by the City Council in the first
place. ... These people were elected.''
   He said it was ``not the best way to deal with these matters to
have the power come down from the state Capitol to throw an elected
official out of office. ... I don't like disrupting the system.''
   The city has asked the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to
block the contempt finding and the fines while it appeals the
judge's action.
   Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, urging the city council to meet
before Tuesday and get the city out of contempt, outlined possible
actions the control board can take should the city fail to act.
   Those actions include imposition of a wage and hiring freeze, a
halt of discretionary spending and, finally, taking over
disbursement of all city funds, she said in a letter to the council.
   By Tuesday's meeting, the aggregate fines will total $25,500,
she said.

   Common Cause asked a federal court Thursday to
close what it says is a loophole that allows presidential campaigns
to benefit from millions of dollars in indirect contributions from
``fat cats.''
   However, Fred Wertheimer, president of the group which lobbies
for strict government ethics, acknowledged that little more than
``moral force'' could be exerted this year to keep the presidential
campaigns from using so-called ``soft money.''
   Republicans and Democrats have said they plan to raise about $67
million in ``soft money'' for the 1988 presidential campaigns,
which are limited to receiving equal funding from the federal
Treasury.
   The ``soft money'' is donated to state parties, which can use it
to pay for voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives as well
as other activities that could have an effect on the presidential
election.
   ``Soft money allows a presidential campaign to raise campaign
contributions that the presidential campaign finance law was
enacted to ban,'' Wertheimer said at a news conference. ``It opens
the door for `fat cats' and special interest givers to provide
large sums of money to help a presidential candidate and thereby
creates the opportunity for these givers to buy influence with the
president of the United States.''
   Robert Farmer, the Dukakis campaign's fund-raiser who plans to
raise $42 million in ``soft money,'' said he supported closing the
loophole in the law and blamed the Republicans for causing the
circumstances by traditionally outspending the Democrats in this
area.
   ``I refuse to apologize for trying to create a level playing
field with the Republicans,'' Farmer said in a telephone interview
from Miami. ``Until they close the loopholes, I want to compete
with the Republicans dollar for dollar.''
   Albert Maruggi, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee, said there was no immediate reaction to the Common Cause
action.
   A year ago, U.S. District Judge Thomas Flannery, in a lawsuit
brought by Common Cause, ordered the Federal Election Commission to
draw up rules governing the use of ``soft money.''
   Those rules have not been written, and Common Cause filed a
request with the U.S. District Court on Thursday for an order
giving the FEC a month to produce a draft of the proposed
regulations.
   Even if a hearing were granted immediately and Common Cause won,
it is unlikely that the rules could have more than marginal legal
impact before this November's presidential election, according to
Roger Witten, an attorney for Common Cause.
   FEC spokesman Fred Eiland said the commission's general counsel
has been working on the rules and is sifting through public
comments received last March.
   ``You have a small staff of two people who are doing our rule
making,'' Eiland said.
   He did not know when a draft of the proposed rules would be
ready.
   Wertheimer said Common Cause believes the use of ``soft money''
for presidential campaigns is illegal and if the FEC had drafted
rules to that effect, it could discourage the practice.
   ``This is illegal money,'' Wertheimer said. ``This is money that
was outlawed in response to Watergate.''
   Under questioning, however, Wertheimer acknowledged that while
Common Cause raised the issue of illegality in its arguments before
the court last year, ``the court did not endorse that position.''

<HEAD>North Lawyers Say Judge Unfair for Pushing Speedy Trial</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 6th graf bgng ``Not only'' with four new grafs to INSERT
additional quote from North brief and to UPDATE with Walsh's reply.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Oliver L. North accused the judge
in the Iran-Contra case Thursday of abandoning fairness in order to
put the former White House aide on trial before the fall
presidential election.
   The attorneys asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to
postpone until January a hearing scheduled for next Monday on the
use of classified information at the trial.
   The defense said a delay is needed because lawyers haven't ``had
time to even review in any detail the hundreds of thousands of
pages of classified and `sensitive' documents'' turned over by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   North's lawyers said Gesell had imposed impossible deadlines on
the defense for preparing for Monday's hearing and the trial, set
to begin Sept. 20.
   ``In its frantic rush to trial before the election, the court
seems to have abandoned all sense of what is possible and what is
fair,'' attorneys Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. and Barry Simon said in a
brief pleading filed in U.S. District Court.
   ``The hearing, if it is held on Aug. 8, will be a complete sham,
and the court knows it,'' the defense lawyers said in their
harshest attack on Gesell.
   ``Not only is the court's current schedule totally unreasonable;
it is directly contrary to the court's claim that it is `simply
trying to be fair to both sides,''' the defense said, quoting
Gesell's remarks at a hearing last week.
   In a reply brief filed later in the day, Walsh said North's
request for a delay ``reveals the artificiality of the stream of
demands and complaints to which the government and the court have
been subjected since arraignment.''
   ``In no way should the defendant's failure to cooperate with the
court be rewarded with the interminable delays he seeks,'' Walsh
said.
   North is accused of conspiring with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and
Richard V. Secord to illegally divert the profits of U.S.-Iran arms
sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Separate trials have been
ordered for the other three men.
   Gesell has ruled that North is entitled to inspect a large
volume of classified documents in order to try to show that he
acted with the permission of higher officials in the Reagan
administration.
   The hearing Monday is scheduled to consider North's proposals to
use classified information at the trial. The Classified Information
Procedures Act sets up a mechanism under which a defendant must
notify the court and the government of his plan to disclose
classified information.
   If government agencies refuse to declassify documents the court
deems relevant to the case, charges could be dropped.
   Walsh, trying to buy more time to deal with the problems of
declassifying the documents, has suggested that Gesell put aside
the major conspiracy counts against North and proced to trial on 13
other charges.
   These counts, which the prosecution contends don't involve
nearly as many classified documents, include allegations that North
lied to Congress, obstructed a presidential investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair and illegally enriched himself.
   He is also charged with illegally using a tax-exempt foundation
to raise money for the Contras.
   The defense also responded to Walsh's charge that it had flouted
the law and Gesell's order by failing to specify which government
secrets it wants to disclose in court. Gesell had ordered North to
file that notice by Aug. 1.
   The defense said it filed its 265-page list of documents because
it was ``faced with the possibility that documents not listed in
the notice could be precluded from use at trial.''

   A stream of Justice Department officials
lauded Attorney General Edwin Meese III and showered him with
plaques and gifts Thursday in a farewell ceremony that for two
hours ignored the investigation that had plagued the nation's chief
legal officer.
   None of the 21 speakers commented directly on independent
counsel James C. McKay's investigation of Meese's personal
financial dealings or on claims by two former Justice Department
officials that a deep malaise had overcome the agency as a result
of Meese's legal troubles.
   The farewell ceremonies, open to department employees, ran on so
long that Meese said he was keeping his remarks short because the
activities were ``intruding on lunch hour.''
   Besides a variety of plaques and other souvenirs, Meese received
a tomahawk with a peace pipe, an inoperative hand grenade, and a
cap supposedly designed for a czar.
   Some of the hundreds of workers who packed the auditorium and
stood on the balcony left before Meese spoke. Meese's wife, Ursula,
and his daughter, Dana, sat in the front row.
   Later in the day, Meese invited several hundred Justice
Department officials and others to a drop-in party where he stood
in a receiving line as people sipped white wine and punch and ate
hors d'oeuvres.
   Meese, who is resigning this month after 3{ years in which he
has faced a barrage of criticism for his conduct, said he was
``really overwhelmed'' by the outpouring of praise which came from
men who are political appointees, though a few had risen through
the career ranks.
   Last month, McKay issued a report concluding criminal
prosecution of Meese was unwarranted, though he said Meese probably
violated tax laws.
   Meese has attacked McKay's report as well as testimony by Arnold
I. Burns, the former deputy attorney general, and William Weld,
former head of the criminal division. Both men criticized Meese on
Capitol Hill last week.
   William Bradford Reynolds, Meese's counselor and one of his
closest working confidants, said Meese has been ``fully engaged and
fully involved'' in leading the department. ``There is no rancor or
vindictiveness'' in the attorney general, he said.
   Speakers at the farewell included FBI Director William Sessions;
Solicitor General Charles Fried; J. Michael Quinlan, director of
the bureau of prisons; Alan Nelson, head of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, and several assistant attorneys general.
   Some of the speakers talked about Meese's professional
accomplishments and many recounted personal _ and sometimes
emotional stories _ about the outgoing attorney general.
   Meese has promoted civil rights, assisted Indians, worked with
Europeans, helped spur the economy and cracked down on crime,
various speakers said.
   Patrick Korten, Meese's spokesman, described the attorney
general as a ``friendly and affable'' man who has a ``genial
nature,'' and ``never loses his temper.'' One of the best things
about the job, Korten said was, ``It's never been boring.''
   In his remarks, Meese thanked the Justice Department's 72,000
employees for their ``selfless devotion,'' and cited the agency's
handling of prison riots in Atlanta and Louisiana last November as
one of its finest moments. Prison workers who had been taken
hostage by Cuban inmates were released unharmed after more than a
week of negotiations.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush said
Thursday that Michael Dukakis' views on foreign policy would amount
to ``unilateral disarmament'' and called the Democratic platform
``the black hole of American politics.''
   Speaking to the G.I. Forum, a Hispanic veterans' group, the
Republican nominee-to-be said Dukakis had ``veered far outside the
mainstream'' bipartisan consensus formed after World War II _ a
consensus that believed ``it was America and only America that
could lead the world to freedom and peace.''
   ``His positions ... amount to a rejection of America's role as a
world leader and a repudiation of the Truman doctrine and the
vision of John Kennedy,'' Bush said.
   His speech came in the wake of the vice president's repeated
attempts this week to portray Dukakis as soft on foreign policy _
an area seen by Republican strategists as one in which the
Massachusetts governor is vulnerable.
   Bush cited Dukakis' support for a nuclear freeze, and opposition
to a new MX missile, the Midgetman missile and the Reagan
administration's proposed ``Star Wars'' nuclear defense system.
   Dukakis, campaigning in Mississippi, was asked by reporters if
he still supports a nuclear weapons freeze. ``Sure, and a
comprehensive test ban treaty,'' he said.
   Later, aboard his campaign plane, Dukakis said he originally
supported a nuclear freeze ``because we wanted to stop the
administration from expanding the arsenal.''
   ``Now, it's turned around and we're talking about reduction. I'm
for reductions now,'' he said. ``There are certain weapons systems
whose development I favor ... but there are also serious
negotiations under way. I'm for developing certain weapons systems
and for substantially reducing others.''
   Asked again if he was for a freeze, Dukakis said, ``No, I favor
the development of certain arms systems. I favor deep cuts in
strategic weapons systems.''
   Bush said Dukakis' views add up to no modernization of U.S.
forces ``and no modernization amounts to unilateral disarmament.''
   Dukakis called Bush's disarmament charge ``nonsense,'' and
added: ``We have a massive survivable nuclear deterrent right now,
12,000 strategic nuclear warheads. What we don't have is the kind
of strong conventional defense capability we must have and that is
going to be my top priority as president.''
   Bush said the Democratic platform is no help in trying to
determine where the Democratic presidential nominee stood on
foreign policy issues.
   ``The Democratic platform is the black hole of American
politics,'' he said. ``Issues get sucked into it and lost, never to
reappear again.''
   At an airport news conference, Bush was asked whether members of
his campaign staff had been advancing rumors concerning Dukakis'
mental health.
   ``I assume no one in my campaign is doing anything of that
kind,'' he said. ``I would thoroughly disapprove of it.''
   He also said President Reagan was ``broad-minded'' in retracting
his comment on Wednesday in which he referred to Dukakis as an
``invalid,'' and said the Massachusetts governor's ``response was
fine.''
   Meanwhile, Bush campaign staffers have been told to do nothing
to keep alive the rumors about Dukakis' mental health after Bush
himself wondered whether some of the information was coming from
his campaign, according to his chief of staff, Craig Fuller.
   ``He asked me the question,'' Fuller said. ``I have no reason to
believe we have any of our people behind it.''
   Fuller said Campaign Manager Lee Atwater gathered the Bush staff
together Wednesday ``and admonished everybody to stay out of this
story, stay out of the rumor business.''
   ``George Bush doesn't want us involved in that kind of a
story,'' Fuller said. ``One of the troublesome aspects of a
presidential campaign is that a rumor takes off and has a life of
its own. I don't know what the reality is but I figure it's up to
somebody else besides us to find out.''
   On another subject, Fuller confirmed that Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III would resign his post to become chairman of the
Bush campaign before the start of the GOP convention on August 15.
   Baker's plans to join the campaign have been widely reported,
and previously confirmed by sources in both the Bush campaign and
the Reagan administration.
   Sources have said that Reagan would nominate New York investment
banker Nicholas Brady to serve out the remainder of Baker's term,
and that the announcement could come as early as Friday.
   However, Fuller said there still ``is no lock'' on the exact day
for Baker's job switch.
   At the news conference, Bush predicted that he would win Texas _
his adopted state _ despite the presence on the Democratic ticket
of vice presidential candidate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   ``The race is between George Bush and Michael Dukakis in
Texas,'' he said. ``I am going to spend what it takes and be here
as long as it takes to win Texas.''
   He said he hopes to win the Hispanic vote, even though he
doesn't speak Spanish as Dukakis and Bentsen do.
   ``It isn't whether you can speak Spanish, it's what is in your
heart,'' Bush said. ``He (Dukakis) can speak Spanish, but I have
the heartbeat.'' Bush then repeated his often-used reference to his
three grandchildren who are part Mexican-American.
   Bush later traveled to Chicago to attend the wake of the late
Aloysius Majewski, president of the National Polish Alliance,
before returning to Washington.
   ``He was an outstanding example for all of us,'' Bush told
reporters outside the funeral home in northwest Chicago. The vice
president refused to answer political questions, saying: ``I am
here to pay my respects to a great Polish-American. That's all I
want to say.''

<HEAD>Paper Says St. Basil's Cathedral Has Serious Structural Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   St. Basil's Cathedral, the 400-year-old patchwork
of color anchoring one end of Red Square, has serious structural
defects but is kept open because of the money it earns from
tourism, a newspaper said Thursday.
   Sovietskaya Kultura said St. Basil's, built in 1554-1560 by
order of Ivan the Terrible, has cracked walls, a leaky basement and
problems caused by temperature variations and moisture.
   Its onion domes of red, green, gold and blue sit atop a central
chapel and nine small ones connected by narrow passageways.
   More than 300,000 tourists a year visit the cathedral, one of
the most famous attractions in the Soviet Union, the paper said.
The structure is an adjunct of the State Historical Museum.
   Tourists let in heat, cold or moisture depending on the season,
and officials discovered five years ago the basement was absorbing
underground water, a ``terrible loss that has victimized many of
Moscow's monuments of architecture,'' the paper said.
   Instead of closing the church for repairs or on days when it is
too hot, too cold or too humid, officials keep it open for the
tourists, Sovietskaya Kultura reported.
   ``The main thing is that the cathedral brings without
interruption about 300,000 rubles (roughly $480 million) of clear
income every year to the State Historical Museum,'' it said.
   The museum itself, on the opposite side Red Square, has been
closed for the two years for repairs and probably will stay closed
for two more, the newspaper said. That leaves St. Basil's and a
small museum at Moscow's Novodevichy Cemetery as the State
Historical's only moneymakers.
   ``To close the cathedral in this situation means leaving workers
of the State Historical Museum without an income,'' it said.
   Sovietskaya Kultura paper said it did not want to sensationalize
the cathdral's problems, but warned that many architectural
landmarks have been damaged because cursory inspections did not
reveal their true structural problems.
   It said: ``There is no tragedy. So far. Whether one will happen,
no one knows. But we have to know. ... If some misfortune befalls
the cathedral, our entire generation will never be cleansed of the
shame.''
   Ivan the Terrible ordered the cathedral built to celebrate the
Russian defeat of Tatar invaders at Kazan.
   Legend says he had the architects blinded after St. Basil's was
built so they could not design anything to rival it.

   Here are some comments Thursday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, blasting the Democrats for crafting a platform that
he says gives no indication of where Dukakis stands on foreign
policy issues: ``The Democratic platform is the black hole of
American politics. Issues get sucked into it and lost, never to
reappear again.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, asked if he supports a nuclear weapons freeze:
``Sure, and a comprehensive test ban treaty.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, asked again if he supports a nuclear freeze:
``No, I favor the development of certain arms systems. I favor deep
cuts in strategic weapons systems.''
   
   California Gov. GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN, taking himself out of the
running for vice president in a letter to Bush: ``I am honored and
very grateful for your consideration, but I must tell you that I
cannot be considered for the office of the vice president.''
   
   New York Gov. MARIO CUOMO, one of several Democrats pointing
fingers at the Republicans for spreading rumors about Michael
Dukakis's medical history: ``There's something significant about
what the Republicans have done here, the fact that they would use
Lyndon LaRouche to get this thing started, the fact that they would
get negative, that they would get so irrelevant so early.''

   A fire early Thursday destroyed what would
have been the first black fraternity house on the University of
Mississippi's Fraternity Row, and authorities suspect arson,
officials said.
   No one was occupying the two-story house, school officials said.
Members of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity were to move into the house
later this month.
   Fire Chief Terry McDonald said flammable fluids were found in a
closet where the early morning fire apparently started. He said the
material had been sent to the state crime laboratory for
examination.
   ``All of us at the University of Mississippi are saddened by
this tragedy,'' university Chancellor Gerald Turner said in a
statement. ``If arson is proven to be the cause, we are making it
absolutely clear that such reprehensible acts will not be tolerated
on our campus.''
   Turner said the university would work to find alternative
housing for the 20-member fraternity.
   Fraternity adviser Thomas Wallace does not have a listed
telephone number and could not be reached for comment.
   In 1962, riots broke out on the University of Mississippi campus
when James Meredith became the first black student to register at
the all-white school.
   University spokesman Ed Meek said the state College Board
recently approved leasing the house formerly occupied by Sigma Pi
to the black fraternity. He said the lease hadn't been signed yet,
but Phi Beta Sigma members had been allowed access to the house
during the past couple of days to make preparations to move in.
   He said the 50-year-old house had been vacant for some time.
   Meek said he didn't know if there were any other vacant houses
on Fraternity Row that could be offered to the fraternity. But he
said school officials would do their best to find other
accommodations for the group before students start arriving Aug. 20.

<HEAD>Heat and Scattered Rainfall Continue ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heat and rain bathed the nation Thursday with showers and
thunderstorms scattered across the upper Midwest, the South and
parts of the West. In the Northeast, it was so hot that Harvard
University planned to close for the first summer weekday in 352
years.
   Showers and thunderstorms ranged across central Arizona,
northeast Colorado to northern New Mexico, southern Texas, Kansas
to southern North Dakota, western Tennessee into southern Missouri
and Arkansas, as well as across the Southeast and eastern Gulf
Coast, and the upper Great Lakes.
   Near Detroit, gusty winds and small hail accompanied a
thunderstorm, while lightning, hail, high winds and record amounts
of rainfall pounded northeastern Colorado late Wednesday and early
Thursday. At least five mobile homes were torn off their
foundations in Fort Collins, and 12 people suffered bruises after
they ran from an office building into pounding hail.
   The Northeast and Great Lakes region continued to bake, with
Madison, Wis., reaching 90 degrees or above for the ninth day in a
row. Temperature records for the date were broken or tied in Grand
Rapids, Mich., where a reading of 95 tied the Aug. 4, 1947,
temperature; Lansing, Mich., where a high of 96 tied the 1881
reading; Madison, where the old mark of 96, set in 1947, was broken
by one degree; and Portland, Maine, where the high of 89 tied the
1944 reading.
   But Madison got quick relief from a thunderstorm, which cooled
it down to 85 in 20 minutes.
   The oppressive heat and bad air quality, blamed on a lingering
Bermuda high, prompted Harvard University to give summer students a
three-day weekend by canceling classes Friday, said Peter Costa, a
spokesman for the Cambridge, Mass., school.
   The school is known to have shut down only once before, during
the blizzard of 1978, he said.
   ``Not all of Harvard is air conditioned,'' he explained. ``We
thought we'd give our students and staff a three-day weekend until
things cool off.''
   In New York, the muggy heat shattered power-use records and
forced the rescheduling of track and field events at the Empire
State Games. Thursday was the 20th day this summer of above
90-degree temperatures, according to the National Weather Service
in Albany, N.Y. The average is about eight for the summer, said
meterologist Robert Barton.
   The Hudson River was so warm that Con Edison expressed concern
about the ability of the water to effectively cool the Indian Point
2 nuclear power plant in an emergency, a spokesman said.
   On Wednesday night and early Thursday, the river's temperature
reached 85 degrees, prompting notification to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission of an ``unusual event,'' spokesman Marty
Gitten said.
   ``This is not a problem in normal operations,'' he said. But as
a precaution, the utility has lowered the plant's power output from
885 megawatts to 500 megawatts.
   Illinois conservation officials expressed concerned about the
growing number of fish kills in rivers and ponds drained of oxygen
by high temperatures.
   About 2,000 catfish, carp, drum and white perch died near Rock
Falls in the Hennepin Canal in July, thousands more died in the
Illinois & Michigan Canal near La Salle and more than a hundred
dead fish were discovered along the Mississippi River north of
Cordova recently, they said.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 106 at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The forecast for Friday called for showers and thunderstorms
extending from northern New England across the Great Lakes and
south and west into western Tennessee and the Appalachians, with
other showers from the south Atlantic coast to the lower
Mississippi Valley, over southwest and central Texas, and over
parts of Missouri, Kansas, northern Arizona and notheast Nevada.
   High temperatures will be in the 90s or near 90 degrees over
much of the nation. Highs in the 70s and 80s will extend from the
Great Lakes across the upper half of the Mississippi Valley, the
central Plains and southern Colorado and northern Arizona, and
along the northern Pacific coast.

<HEAD>Anglican Bishops Say They Understand Need for Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's Anglican bishops adopted
a resolution Thursday that states they understand people who choose
armed struggle ``as the only way to justice'' but condemns war as
un-Christian.
   The bishops also decided Thursday to allow polygamists into
their church, provided they marry no more wives after baptism. The
bishops, all men, did not address the issue of polyandry, where a
woman takes several husbands.
   Archbishop Robert Eames of All Ireland, who represents Anglicans
in both the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, harshly criticized
the violence clause. He said the statement could be used by the
Irish Republican Army to justify its violent campaign to drive the
British out of the province of Northern Ireland.
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa supported the clause,
pointing to people without parliamentary means of seeking justice.
   The 525 bishops from 164 countries were assembled in Canterbury
for the Lambeth Conference, held every 10 years. They represent 70
million Anglicans worldwide. Their three-week conference ends
Sunday.
   After 10 minutes of debate, the bishops accepted by a show of
hands the resolution titled ``War, Violence and Justice,'' which
condemns war as ``incompatible with the teaching and example of Our
Lord Jesus Christ.''
   The disputed clause says the conference ``understands those who,
after exhausting all other ways, choose the way of armed struggle
as the only way to justice whilst drawing attention to the dangers
and injustices possible in such action.''
   Bishop Brian Hannon of Northern Ireland told the bishops that
armed struggle in his province ``is simply leading us farther,
farther, and farther into depravity, immorality and further
violence.''
   Attempts by Irish bishops to have the words ``in self-defense''
inserted into the clause were defeated 226 to 168, with 29 bishops
abstaining.
   Archbishop Eames, in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp. after the vote, spoke strongly against the wording.
   ``We are losing members of our church, Anglicans who are serving
in the security forces of Northern Ireland. We are losing
civilians. Two of them are being buried today and tomorrow in my
diocese and in Belfast,'' Eames said.
   The IRA this week killed three members of Britain's security
forces in the predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland, which it
seeks to unite with the Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   Tutu said the resolution referred to people who did not have
parliamentary means to effect political change. South Africa's
apartheid system of institutionalized racial segregation denies the
vote to the country's 26 million black majority. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   ``Our people have used conventional means, and each time the
response has been a violent response,'' said Tutu, the black church
leader who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``We are not asking you to condone or condemn, but we are asking
you to say to those of our people who have tried everything: we
understand. The church is not pacifist,'' Tutu said.
   Bishop David Young of Ripon, northern England, said after the
vote that the resolution was drawn up by a large group of bishops
meeting privately during the conference, with especially strong
support from bishops in South Africa and Latin America.
   ``We felt we had to take a wide view for the whole of the
Anglican Communion,'' said Young, who proposed the resolution.
   Archbishop John Habgood of York, England, spoke in favor of the
clause after the vote.
   ``The Irish sensitivity was very much borne in mind, as was the
feeling that the IRA will pick up and twist to their own use
anything which seemed to offer them a handle of support,'' he said.
   But he said the key word was ``understand'' and that while both
sides of the Irish conflict had ``perfectly good Parliamentary
methods,'' other Christians around the world might not.
   The vote on polygamy was also taken by a show of hands, with
only about 12 of the 525 participating bishops opposed.
   Under the policy, the Anglican Church will recognize both
husbands and their multiple wives as Christians if the men take no
new brides after they are baptized.
   After the vote, Bishop Ralph Hatendi of Harare, in the Church of
the Province of Central Africa, said polygamy was not a major issue
anymore in Africa.
   ``The culture is potentially polygamous, but it does usually
depend on the area and also the wealth of the bridegroom,'' he said.
   There are no women bishops in the Anglican Communion, but
several of the autonomous churches in the communion, including the
2.5 million-member Episcopal Church of the United States, have
ordained women priests.
   On Monday, the bishops approved a compromise resolution on the
issue.
   In effect, it recognized that nothing can be done to prevent
Anglican churches in the United States, Canada and New Zealand from
consecrating a woman bishop after ordaining hundreds of women
priests.
   The resolution said the 27 self-governing Anglican churches
should respect such a move and that a commission headed by Runcie
be set up to prepare guidelines for it.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Testifies In Convention Speech Videotape Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson
testified Thursday that his livelihood is being hurt by a company
selling videotapes of his speech at the Democratic National
Convention.
   Jackson has sued MPI Home Video of suburban Oak Forest to try to
halt sales and distribution of the tape, and he testified in
support of a request that the company be permanently barred from
distributing it.
   ``It has hurt the ability of my family to ... negotiate with a
distributor to sell my own words and image and likeness,'' Jackson
told U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel and about 100 spectators.
   ``It has reduced our ability to make a living off my work,'' he
said.
   The lawsuit charges MPI is exploiting Jackson's name, stature,
and literary, oratorical and creative skills, and it seeks to have
copies of the videotape destroyed.
   As the hearing closed, Zagel renewed a temporary order
prohibiting MPI from selling and distributing more of the tapes
until Aug. 12 and scheduled another hearing for Aug. 11.
   Jackson testified that he reaped $100,000 four years ago from
marketing a videotape of his speech to the 1984 Democratic National
Convention, and that MPI's distribution of this year's speech has
cut into its market potential.
   Lawyers for MPI contend that the convention speech was a news
event unprotected by copyright law and that MPI legitimately
purchased ABC-TV's coverage of the speech from the network for
$6,500.
   ``They are not pirates,'' attorney Robert Breisblatt said of MPI
after the hearing. ``They have a right to that tape.''
   The 60-minute tape, titled ``Jesse Jackson: We Can Dream
Again,'' is uncut ABC coverage, complete with commercials, he said.
   Jaffer Ali, vice president of marketing for MPI, a family-owned
business, has said previously that his company received 25,000
orders for the $14.95 videotape within 24 hours after it went on
the market.
   Ali has said the July 19 speech was ``a very special moment in
history'' and that he and his family decided to market it while
Jackson was delivering it.
   Jackson said he learned about the MPI venture four days later by
reading about it in a newspaper, and he called his lawyer to take
legal action.
   When Breisblatt asked Jackson if he had tried to contact Ali
before instituting legal action, Jackson replied, ``I felt too
insulted by the commercial exploitation of me.''
   During almost an hour on the witness stand, Jackson limited most
of his responses to brief answers, in contrast to his usually
expansive style, but his sense of humor edged in when Breisblatt
tried to place the address in the context of prime-time television.
   ``You understand what I mean by prime time?'' Breisblatt asked.
   ``When I speak,'' Jackson replied, prompting the courtroom to
erupt in laughter and even bringing a smile to Zagel's face.

<NOTE>EDs: Top 9 grafs new to update with Senate considering bill.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Senate began again Thursday efforts to
come up with a Pentagon budget bill that President Reagan will
accept, a day after Reagan vetoed a military spending bill which he
charged would weaken U.S. defenses.
   The Senate started consideration of a bill appropriating $282
billion for the Pentagon, although no votes or major debate were
expected before Friday.
   Reagan had vetoed a bill authorizing $299.5 billion in Pentagon
spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, but indicated he
might sign the companion appropriation measure.
   In the complicated congressional budget process, one set of
legislation is passed to authorize spending, and then separate
measures are enacted to actually appropriate the money to pay for
those authorized projects.
   Although the bill considered Thursday appropriates $16 billion
less than the measure rejected by Reagan, the appropriation measure
essentially covers the same projects. However, the dollar totals
are not as large because authorizing bills generally permit
spending for more long-range projects, amounts which are contained
in the authorization measures.
   Two of Reagan's main objections to the authorization bill were
its reductions in his request for Star Wars anti-missile spending,
and arms control policy restrictions added by the Democratic-backed
Congress.
   The appropriations bill considered Thursday contains the same
cuts in Star Wars funds, but none of the arms control restrictions.
However, those restrictions could be added later.
   When the Senate passes its appropriation bill, the measure will
go to a House-Senate conference committee to be reconciled with the
similar bill enacted by the House six weeks ago.
   Earlier Thursday, leading conservatives said Reagan's veto of
the defense bill had bolstered conservative support for the
presidential candidacy of Vice President George Bush.
   ``We told the president there was nothing he could have done
that would have given our troops more of a shot in the arm than
this veto,'' Edwin J. Fuelner Jr., president of the Heritage
Foundation, told reporters.
   Fuelner and other supporters of Reagan's military policies were
interviewed outside the White House after meeting with the
president in the Cabinet Room.
   ``He will go out, in our opinion, the way President Eisenhower
did, with a strong, principled fight on an issue that will bring
our people together,'' Fuelner said.
   ``We've had trouble this summer getting people interested,'' he
said. ``Whatever the intention, this piece of work, the veto, was a
brilliant stroke because I haven't seen people so excited in
months.''
   Reagan disavowed any partisan intent in vetoing the bill on
Wednesday.
   Also applauding the veto was retired Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham,
president of High Frontier, a principal supporter of the
president's Star Wars space-based missile defense system.
   Graham said High Frontier members ``are not only delighted that
the president vetoed it, they are delighted that George Bush urged
the veto and they're delighted that George Bush is taking a
stronger stand on SDI.''
   The formal name of the Star Wars program is Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   John Tower of Texas, former Republican chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said, ``I think the president having
vetoed the bill and having drawn the issue clearly is going to make
it more politically perilous for the Democratic majority in
Congress to repeat the bad legislation that appeared in this bill.''
   Richard Perle, former assistant secretary of defense and now a
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said, ``The key issue
was the future of SDI. This is not a dispute over details or
precise funding levels. The action taken by Congress ... was
intended to kill the program without taking political
responsibility.''
   Although the bill provided approximately the funds that Reagan
had requested, administration officials say it would have crippled
Star Wars by shifting funds away from the most promising areas of
research.
   Kenneth Adelman, former director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said: ``The big message here is that bad
national security is bad politics. This was a bad national security
bill and to veto it is good politics.''
   Adelman saw the veto as ``the start of the issue-focused Bush
campaign and the staving off of creeping lame duckism for the
Reagan administration.''
   Others attending the meeting included Earl Stock, commander in
chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars; Edwin Rowny, arms control
adviser to the president; Dr. Edward Teller, the nuclear physicist,
and Anna Chennault, president of TAC international.

   The Senate inched toward bipartisan agreement
late Thursday on a proposed aid package for Nicaragua's Contra
rebels after Democrats promised to ensure a chance for a separate
vote on military aid before Congress adjourns for the year.
   ``We're getting very, very close,'' said Sen. David Boren of
Oklahoma, a pro-Contra Democrat, after a day of proposals and
counterproposals between the two parties.
   A key to reaching agreement appeared to be a new letter from
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, promising to bring any request
from President Reagan for weapons aid for the rebels to a quick
vote. The letter, Boren said, would include a guarantee that
Congress would not adjourn without acting on such a request first.
   Wright made a similar promise as part of an agreement on
humanitarian aid for the Contras last March, but several Republican
senators said they needed stronger assurances.
   ``There's a great deal of suspicion of Jim Wright,'' said Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz.
   The negotiations, which included Reagan's national security
adviser, Colin Powell, began shortly after the White House rejected
a Democratic aid proposal that had been worked out a day earlier.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas drew up a list of
objections to the Democratic aid proposal, and Democrats said later
they were willing to make some minor changes in an effort to win
broader support for the measure.
   ``We'd love to see Bob Dole and the Republicans join us on
this,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. But Dodd added that
Democrats would not budge on major aspects of the package because
to do so would destroy the fragile agreement among Democrats that
led to the proposal on Wednesday.
   The Democratic proposal, which defers action on lethal aid for
the rebels until later this year, ``falls far short of getting any
real hope for freedom and democracy in Nicaragua,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``Humanitarian aid is too
limited, too narrowly defined, to be of any real help.''
   But Fitzwater noted that existing humanitarian aid doesn't run
out until Sept. 30, leaving time to work out a middle ground on the
issue.
   ``There's a good chance for Contra aid legislation to pass,'' he
told reporters. ``Legislators on both sides of aisle and the White
House seem to share the feeling of outrage about the Sandinistas
and support for the Contras, so I think there's a very good chance
of passage of some kind of legislation.''
   Fitzwater referred to recent actions by the leftist government
in Managua to crack down on opponents, shut down opposition media
outlets and expel U.S. diplomats.
   The most vigorous objection from Republican senators to the
Democratic proposal was to its provisions setting up a later
congressional vote on whether to resume the flow of weapons aid to
the rebels.
   The package worked out by Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., would require any presidential request for lethal aid to
go for consideration first by the House, which has traditionally
been more resistant to such aid.
   Republicans also argued that it would give undue influence to
House Speaker Wright, an aid opponent. ``Nobody trusts the
speaker,'' said Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., emerging from a
meeting of Contra supporters. He said Wright has reneged on past
promises as to when and how he would bring Contra aid to the House
floor for a vote.
   Byrd characterized his aid package, worked out over two weeks of
discussions with more than a dozen Senate Democrats, as one that
would give incentives to both the Sandinistas and the rebels to
revive and conclude their faltering peace talks.
   The proposal would provide an additional $27 million in food,
clothing, shelter and medical supplies to continue current rates of
such aid through next March. It also promises economic and trade
assistance for Nicaragua if Managua goes along with ``a
comprehensive final agreement to provide for peace and democracy in
Nicaragua.''
   Conversely, some $16.3 million worth of stockpiled weaponry
could be released to the Contras if President Reagan certifies
before Congress adjourns for the year that two of three conditions
are met: the Sandinistas continue to violate terms of a regional
peace accord; Nicaragua receives ``unacceptable'' levels of
Soviet-bloc weaponry and the Sandinistas launch an ``unprovoked
military attack'' on the Contras.
   But the weapons, withheld from delivery to rebel forces since
the two sides entered a cease-fire earlier this year, would not be
released unless both houses of Congress voted to accept Reagan's
certification, with the House going first.

   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T.
Yazov said Thursday he and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci became
good friends during four days of talks and unprecedented tours of
secret Soviet military bases.
   The rotund, red-cheeked 64-year-old Soviet general was the
constant companion of Carlucci, 57, a career foreign service
officer.
   ``We parted not only as colleagues, but as good friends,'' Yazov
told reporters after a 46-mile drive with Carlucci over mountain
roads on the Crimean Peninsula from the navy's Black Sea port in
Sevastopol to an airport in the city of Simferopol.
   Yazov saw Carlucci and his advisers off on a flight over the
Black Sea to Turkey for talks with Turkish leaders and a visit to a
NATO base.
   Yazov, who first met Carlucci in Berne, Switzerland, in March
and then during the recent superpower summit in Moscow, said
increasing U.S.-Soviet military contacts ``contribute to lessening
tensions and strengthening peace.''
   The two discussed U.S. and Soviet military doctrines, imbalances
in each other's forces, and regional conflicts in the Persian Gulf,
Afghanistan and Southeast Asia, Yazov said. He did not elaborate.
   Carlucci said the two sides refined procedures for preventing
dangerous military incidents.
   The Soviets continued Thursday to provide the visiting Americans
access to their latest military hardware.
   Carlucci and accompanying U.S. Navy officers were allowed aboard
a missile cruiser replete with sophisticated electronic
communications and navigational equipment, and capable of carrying
nuclear weapons.
   The American defense chief spent 45 minutes inspecting
anti-submarine, navigational and missile-launching systems aboard
the cruiser Slava (Glory) docked at a civilian sea terminal on the
Bay of Sevastopol, the headquarters of the Soviet Black Sea fleet.
   It was the first time the Soviets have allowed Americans to
board the Slava, which is the prototype for a class of modern
Soviet missile cruisers. The Slava is the pride of the Black Sea
fleet as its most advanced warship.
   The Soviet chief of staff, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, toured
the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt during a visit to the
United States last month.
   Carlucci, Yazov and the Black Sea fleet commander, Admiral
Mikhail N. Khronopulo, emerged from limousines and walked across a
gangway as a 20-member navy band played and 30 honor guards
carrying Kalashnikov submachine guns stood at attention on the
freshly painted deck.
   American and Soviet flags flying on the ship were dwarfed by a
crowded crop of antennas.
   Reporters and photographers were not allowed on the tour, but
watched from the dock as radar antennas twirled around and a 130mm
gun pivoted on its turret before Carlucci.
   ``It's obviously a very capable ship,'' Carlucci, a former
deputy chief of the CIA and ex-White House national security
adviser, told reporters at the Simferopol airport.
   The ship weighs 12,500 tons, is 613 feet long and can cruise at
up to 34 knots, according to Jane's Fighting Ships. It can fire 16
surface-to-surface cruise missiles with nuclear warheads and eight
surface-to-air missiles.
   Carlucci also turned his attention to the bloody military past
of the Crimea, occupied at various periods by the Turks, the
Russians and Nazi Germany. On Thursday, he stopped by a colorful
two-story indoor mural showing a June 6, 1855, battle during the
Crimean War between the Russians on one side and British, French
and Turkish forces on the other.
   He wound up his visit to the seaside city with a ceremony on a
downtown square. Dozens of sailors lined the square in 88-degree
heat as a navy band played ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and the
Soviet national anthem.
   A few dozen of the town's 230,000 residents waved to Carlucci
and Yazov as their motorcade sped by.
   Carlucci was the first American official to visit Sevastopol
since President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a military delegation
stopped by in 1945 to view the city, which was heavily damaged
during the war. Roosevelt was in the area to attend a summit at the
Crimean city of Yalta with Josef Stalin and British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill.
   Because of the naval base, Sevastopol is off-limits to
foreigners and most Soviets.
   Carlucci told reporters he came away from his visit with new
respect for ``the professionalism of the Soviet military'' and a
better understanding of the Soviet armed forces.
   On Monday, he visited the Kubinka Air Force Base for the first
look at the top-secret Blackjack bomber ever allowed a Western
official, then watched over Soviet war games at the Taman motorized
rifle division base southwest of the capital.

<HEAD>Chatichai Becomes New Thai Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOLLY YONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millionaire Chatichai Choonhavan, a
former army man and diplomat, became Thailand's first elected prime
minister in 12 years on Thursday and vowed to seek better relations
with communist Indochina next door.
   The 66-year-old businessman also told reporters he would
generally continue the economically oriented, pro-Western policies
of his predecessor, Prem Tinsulanonda. Chatichai was a deputy prime
minister under Prem.
   Prem, a former army commander in chief, held the prime
minister's post for eight years but belonged to no political party.
The 67-year-old Prem chose not to stay in office.
   Chatichai was nominated for the top government post by five
political parties who won a majority of seats in July 24
parliamentary elections and agreed to form a coalition government.
   The new prime minister said Thursday that a sixth party has been
added to the coalition, giving it 220 of the 357 seats in
Parliament.
   King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thailand's constitutional monarch,
formally approved the nomination Thursday in a five-paragraph royal
decree, which a parliamentary official delivered to Chatichai on a
golden tray at his home.
   Chatichai said his Cabinet has been completed and will be
announced after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain ends a
visit here next Tuesday.
   Chatichai leads the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party, which won
the most seats. The other coalition partners are the Social Action
Party, Democratic Party, Rassadorn (Citizens) Party, the United
Democracy Party, and the Muan Chon (Mass) Party.
   Asked by reporters about his foreign policy, Chatichai said:
``There will be changes where our neighbors are concerned. We want
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to be our markets, not our battlefield.''
   Thailand's relations with the three nations _ known collectively
as Indochina and once a French colony _ have been strained since
communist forces seized power there in 1975.
   Thailand has been in frequent border clashes with Laos and
Cambodia, and has backed guerrillas fighting Vietnamese occupation
of Cambodia. Few calls have been heard from top Thai officials to
soften Thailand's hardline stance.
   Chatichai also said the government will boost the nation's
minimum wage, now about $3 a day, and the incomes of the rural
population.
   Chatichai, a man with wide business experience, served as
ambassador in five countries from 1960-72, then was foreign
minister, industry minister and deputy prime minister. He helped
found Chart Thai and became its leader in 1986.
   Before Chatichai, Thailand's last elected prime minister was
Seni Pramoj in 1976.
   Analysts say Chatichai does not have strong ties with the
military, traditionally a key player in the rise and fall of
governments here.
   Chatichai also may face the same internal bickering and attacks
from increasingly vocal opposition parties that plagued Prem.
   Prem was Thailand's longest-serving civilian prime minister.
During his tenure, the nation experienced dynamic economic growth
and general political stability, despite two military coup attempts
and several changes of Cabinet.

<HEAD>Three Detained in Reported Coup Plot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vinicio Cerezo on Thursday said
three civilians were arrested in connection with a plot to
destabilize his government.
   In a brief statement, Cerezo said the three tried to involve
government officials in a plot ``to destabilize the democratic
system'' but gave no further details.
   The president identified the three as Guillermo Florian Crorado,
40; Alejandro Guzman Roman, 60; and Jose Martin Recinos de Zepeda,
43.
   Cerezo said the men were detained in Guatemala City, the
capital, and that the case was being referred to judicial courts.
He did not say what charges would be brought against them.
   Cerezo also announced that he would not attend the inauguration
of Ecuadoran President-elect Rodrigo Borja in Quito on Wednesday.
He cited pressing matters of economic policy for his decision to
remain in Guatemala.
   Earlier Thursday, army spokesman Col. Luis Arturo Isaacs
Rodriguez denied there had been any coup plot against the president.
   Rodriguez said in a telephone interview that Cerezo met with
Defense Minister Gen. Hector Alejandro Gramajo Morales on Thursday
but did not discuss any efforts to overthrow the government.
   The newspaper La Hora reported Thursday a coup attempt had been
broken up by the government on July 30. It said three people were
arrested in connection with the plot, but did not cite any sources
for the report.
   Rumors have circulated in the capital that the three civilians
approached several military officers to solicit their help in
overthrowing the government. Reports that the three belong to the
opposition right-ring National Liberation Movement could not be
independently confirmed.
   Army forces loyal to Cerezo's government quashed a coup attempt
on May 11 led by dissident officers in the divided military. Five
civilians and six military officers were charged in the attempt but
were later freed under an amnesty declared by the Congress.
   Cerezo, a lawyer and leader of the Christian Democratic Party,
was elected to a five-year term in November 1985. It was the first
election in 16 years in which the military did not field a
candidate.

<NOTE>Eds: New material and editing throughout, UPDATING with IRA claims
responsibility, newspaper says IRA may be trying to boost standing
after botched attacks. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four attackers fired more than
100 bullets at point-blank range and killed two men who worked at a
nearby police station, authorities said. The outlawed Irish
Republican Army claimed responsibility.
   The IRA said the men ignored IRA warnings against performing
maintenance or construction for police or the British army in
Northern Ireland.
   Its statement, sent to news organizations in Belfast, threatened
other civilians who do such work.
   The IRA, which is fighting to expel the British from the
province of Northern Ireland, earlier this week killed four members
of Britain's security forces _ three in attacks in Northern Ireland
and one in the bombing of an army barracks in north London. The
attacks injured 42 people.
   Thursday's victims, aged 60 and 64, had been doing maintenance
work at the Royal Ulster Constabulary station in Belleek, County
Fermanagh, near the border with the Irish Republic, police said.
The victims' names were not immediately released.
   The workers were driving in a van to their homes in County
Fermanagh. They had reached a crossroads about 30 yards from the
border when four men, dressed in combat gear and carrying rifles
and handguns, fired from a stolen car, police said.
   Police said up to 150 rounds were fired.
   The IRA's campaign to stop construction work for British
security forces began in August 1985 when a supplier of portable
structures to replace bombed buildings was shot and killed at his
home in Dublin, the Irish capital.
   Since then, several contractors have been killed.
   A Belfast newspaper said earlier Thursday that the upsurge in
IRA violence could signal the start of a yearlong campaign to mark
the 20th anniversary of the outbreak of sectarian and political
strife in Northern Ireland.
   The Irish News, read mainly by Roman Catholics and considered
authoritative on matters concerning the IRA, said the IRA hopes to
sway public opinion on the British mainland behind demands for
pulling British troops out of Northern Ireland.
   It said that as the 20th anniversary of the so-called
``troubles'' approaches, the IRA is determined to prove that
Britain has not succeeded in bringing peace to the province.
   ``The critical thing as far as the IRA is concerned is getting
the debate going _ the debate that will show the British presence
has failed,'' the paper quoted an unidentified nationalist source
as saying.
   The Irish News also said the campaign may be an IRA attempt to
re-establish its standing in staunchly Catholic areas after botched
attacks left 17 civilians dead since November.
   Edward McGrady, a lawmaker from the moderate Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, suggested that the violence may stem
from an internal split on tactics between militants and more
politically minded members of the IRA.
   ``That may be one of the reasons for the increased violent
activity, the increased killings in England and in Ireland. There
could indeed be a division, an increasing division. The military,
the hawks in the group, are trying to sabotage any movement (toward
political reconciliation) taking place,'' he said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
   Britain ordered troops into the province Aug. 14, 1969, after
violence flared in Londonderry during a civil rights march by
Catholics. Since then, at least 2,665 people have died as a result
of sectarian and political fighting.
   The IRA wants to drive the British from Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the British Cabinet member
responsible for the province, has ordered a review of safety
measures for 17,000 police and part-time soldiers based there.

<HEAD>Bush Hits Dukakis as Weak on Defense; Dukakis Campaigns in South</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS one graf of Dukakis comment on defense veto after 6th
graf pvs: President Reagan...defense program; edits to tighten.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and his GOP allies painted Democrat Michael Dukakis
as weak on military and foreign policy Thursday while Dukakis
campaigned in the South, seeking votes where Ronald Reagan won in
1980 and 1984 and where Jesse Jackson did well in this year's
Democratic primaries.
   Prominent Democrats and Dukakis' doctor, meantime, suggested
that political motivations were behind a rumor that Dukakis had
been treated for mental problems _ a rumor both Dukakis and the
doctor denied.
   And the Bush campaign received its strongest ``No, thank you''
yet from a man frequently mentioned as a prospective running mate,
California Gov. George Deukmejian.
   Bush, in Corpus Christi, Texas, told a group of Hispanic
veterans that Dukakis' positions were ``a rejection of America's
role as a world leader and a repudiation of the Truman doctrine and
the vision of John Kennedy.''
   Dukakis' opposition to new nuclear weapons such as the MX
missile were part of a policy for ``unilateral disarmament,'' Bush
told the G.I. Forum.
   President Reagan lent Bush a helping hand earlier this week by
vetoing a defense bill passed by the Democratic-controlled
Congress. Although the bill provided an agreed-upon $299.5 billion
for the Pentagon, Reagan said it was too restrictive, especially on
his ``Star Wars'' missile defense program.
   ``The only reason anyone can possbily give for it is that it
might help the vice president,'' Dukakis said Thursday evening in
Los Angeles. ``I don't think it helps the vice president. It
certainly doesn't help the nation. It doesn't help our national
security.''
   Republicans in the Senate on Thursday were pushing for more
money for arms to the Contras, at least in part to embarrass
Dukakis. The Massachusetts governor's running mate, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, disagrees with Dukakis on that issue and usually
supports Contra aid.
   Dukakis, in Philadelphia, Miss., repeated his theme of making
the military spend its money more wisely. And he told reporters it
was ``nonsense'' for Bush to suggest he favored disarmament.
   ``The fact of the matter is we have a massive survivable nuclear
deterrent right now, 12,000 strategic nuclear warheads,'' he said.
``What we don't have is the kind of strong conventional defense
capability we must have, and that is going to be my top priority as
president.''
   Asked whether he still supports a nuclear freeze, Dukakis said,
``Sure, and a comprehensive test ban treaty.''
   Later aboard his plane, Dukakis said he originally supported a
freeze ``because we wanted to stop the administration from
expanding the arsenal.''
   ``Now, it's turned around and we're talking about reduction. I'm
for reductions now,'' he said. ``I favor the development of certain
arms systems. I favor deep cuts in strategic weapons systems.''
   Dukakis spoke to a mostly white audience estimated at more than
6,000 at the Neshoba County Fair, where eight years ago Reagan
launched his campaign as the new Republican presidential nominee.
   At the same time, he was campaigning in a state where he lost
this year's Democratic primary to Jackson.
   He talked of civil rights in addition to his usual calls for
industrial revitalization and investment in schools.
   ``Let us work together to see that every citizen and every child
born in this country is an equal shareholder in the American
dream,'' he said.
   Elsewhere, Democrats expressed anger about a rumor that Dukakis
had problems with mental depression in the 1970s, first following
the death of his brother and then with his 1978 primary defeat for
re-election as governor.
   ``I think there's something significant about what the
Republicans have done here, the fact that they would use Lyndon
LaRouche to get this thing started, the fact that they would get
negative, that they would get to irrelevant so early,'' said New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   At the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta two weeks ago,
supporters of LaRouche, a political extremist and fringe
presidential candidate, distributed fliers suggesting Dukakis was
unstable.
   Dukakis' doctor for the past 17 years, Gerald R. Plotkin, said,
``I would have to assume that the rumors are political. I don't
know whether the term is dirty tricks, but I think certainly the
allegations ... have no basis in fact.''
   The issue became widely publicized Wednesday after Reagan called
Dukakis ``an invalid'' during a news briefing. Reagan later said he
was trying to make a joke but ``it didn't work.''
   Bush told reporters Thursday that he ``would thoroughly
disapprove of it'' if anyone from his campaign was involved in the
rumor-making.
   His chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said that on Wednesday
campaign manager Lee Atwater ``admonished everybody to stay out of
this story, stay out of the rumor business.''
   Fuller also confirmed that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III
would leave his post and become campaign chief before the Aug. 15
start of the Republican convention in New Orleans.
   Between swipes at Dukakis, Bush is looking for a running mate
but it looked as if it won't be Deukmejian, who as governor of
California might help Bush in the state with the most electoral
votes.
   ``I am honored and very grateful for your consideration, but I
must tell you that I cannot be considered for the office of vice
president,'' Deukmejian said in a letter to Bush, released by
Deukmejian's press secretary in Sacramento, Calif.
   ``As you know, if I were to assume the vice presidency, it would
mean turning the entire executive branch of the nation's most
populous state over to the Democratic Party,'' said Deukmejian, who
was on a trip to Seoul, Korea.

   California Gov. George Deukmejian said
Thursday in a letter to Republican George Bush that he ``cannot be
considered'' for the vice presidency because winning that election
would mean handing over the state's governorship to a Democrat.
   Bush Chief of Staff Craig Fuller said late Thursday that Bush
would respect Deukmejian's wishes, adding, ``He is going to be very
important to us in winning California.''
   Kevin Brett, Deukmejian's press secretary, said the governor
sent the letter to Bush from Seoul, Korea, the final stop in
Deukmejian's two-week trade mission to the Far East.
   Brett said the letter to the certain GOP presidential nominee
was prompted by a request from the Bush campaign for Deukmejian to
fill out financial disclosure forms that the campaign is seeking
from prospective running mates.
   Brett said Deukmejian also received telephone calls in the Far
East from Treasurer Secretary Jim Baker, who is soon to become
Bush's campaign chairman, and Bob Kimmitt, who is heading the
effort to screen vice presidential prospects.
   ``I am honored and very grateful for your consideration, but I
must tell you that I cannot be considered for the office of vice
president,'' Deukmejian said in his letter to Bush.
   ``As you know, if I were to assume the vice presidency, it would
mean turning the entire executive branch of the nation's most
populous state over to the Democratic Party,'' Deukmejian said,
noting that was something he could not consider doing.
   California Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, who is running this year for
the U.S. Senate, and the next four elected officials in the line of
succession for governor should Deukmejian give up the office, are
all Democrats.
   Deukmejian's term ends in 1990. Whoever is governor after that
will be in charge of the state during the congressional
reapportionment based on the 1990 census.
   Reapportionment, done every decade after the census, divides the
state into districts that must be equal in population but are
typically skewed in shape to protect incumbents and members of the
majority party.
   Brett released copies of the Deukmejian letter in Sacramento. He
said in addition to the letter, Deukmejian's chief of staff,
Michael Frost, telephoned Bush aides this morning on Air Force Two
to advise them that Deukmejian was taking himself out of
consideration.
   ``The governor is not going to complete the financial disclosure
forms,'' Brett said the chief of staff advised the Bush campaign.
   The comments in Deukmejian's letter are similar to his
often-repeated public statements that ``even if asked, I would have
to refuse'' the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Despite the denials, Deukmejian's name continues to appear on
lists of potential running mates. He is a Republican governor of
the nation's largest state, and has dropped hints that he might be
interested in the vice presidential post.
   Deukmejian first commented on his interest at a Texas GOP dinner
in May, saying that he was ``hoping that somebody might come along
and figure out a way I could be vice president and at the same time
(let) the Republicans hold onto control of the statehouse in
California.''
   Deukmejian fanned further speculation in early June when he
brushed aside a direct question about the vice presidency by joking
that his astrologer told him not to answer. A few days later, he
responded to the same question by saying, ``You should never say
never.''

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said Thursday that both Iran and Iraq accept the concept of
face-to-face peace talks and the big question is when will they
take place.
   The issue of direct negotiations before a cease-fire has created
an impasse in talks aimed at ending the 8-year-old Persian Gulf
war. Iraq had demanded face-to-face talks before a cease-fire. Iran
said they can only take place afterward.
   ``The concept of direct talks is accepted by both sides, and the
matter is when,'' Perez de Cuellar told reporters Thursday as he
left U.N. headquarters. ``That is something on which I am working.''
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
U.N. chief proposed to both sides that he announce a cease-fire
date and simultaneously invite both Iran and Iraq to hold direct
talks on a comprehensive peace treaty.
   Perez de Cuellar did not spell out his proposals for reporters
and said he has not yet received a formal response from Iraq.
Diplomatic sources have said Baghad is cool but stopped short of
outright rejection.
   Perez de Cuellar said Iran's response, although not formal, has
been ``constructive.''
   ``Unfortunately, from the Iraqi side, I have not received the
comments which I have asked for,'' Perez de Cuellar told reporters.
   The secretary-general received a report Thursday from a U.N.
military team on arrangements for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire in
the war. The contents were not disclosed, but the U.N. chief said
he would make a report to the Security Council in informal
consultations Friday.
   He said that next week, probably on Wednesday, he will deliver a
comprehensive report to the council on the entire situation
relating to declaration of a cease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner
exchange and other elements of a U.N. peace plan.
   It was not clear when he would declare what he calls a ``D-Day''
beginning a cease-fire, but he indicated he could make the
announcement next week.
   The cease-fire report was delivered by Lt. Gen. Martin Vadset,
the Norwegian head of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization in
Jerusalem. He returned from a mission to Tehran and Baghdad, where
he studied arrangements for a U.N.-supervised truce.
   The sources said the secretary-general outlined his ideas for
ending the stalemate over direct talks during in a meeting with the
non-aligned members of the Security Council on Wednesday.
   The plan laid out before Argentina, Algeria, Nepal, Zambia,
Senegal and Yugoslavia, the non-aligned council members, was
disclosed as Perez de Cuellar met for more than an hour with
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran. Velayati left without
making a comment.
   Under the secretary-general's plan, direct talks could start the
same day a cease-fire was announced, perhaps in a week or 10 days.
No dates have been set.
   It is one of the compromises Perez de Cuellar has weighed in
trying to close the gap between the Iranian and Iraqi positions.
Iraq says it needs the talks as a guarantee of sincerity from Iran,
which resisted U.N. peace efforts for a year and then suddenly
agreed to them last month.
   The sources said the secretary-general wants to secure the
commitment of Iran and Iraq to a comprehensive, sequential
implemention of Resolution 598, including a cease-fire, troop
withdrawal and repatriation of prisoners of war.
   Iraq also has been seeking the assurance of the five permanent
members of the 15-member Security Council to guarantee a
cease-fire. The five _ United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain
and France _ have been drafting a paper calling for direct talks
and appealing to both sides to bring a swift end to the conflict.
   Iraq says it fears Iran will seek only a temporary truce to
regroup forces, not a permanent peace, and so it wants some kind of
international underwriting of an agreement.
   Earlier Thursday, Iran urged the Security Council to condemn an
alleged Iraqi chemical attack in which it says 1,700 civilians were
injured. Iran says most of the casualties were women and children.
   No word emerged on whether the U.N. chief would send another
chemical weapons team to look into the latest allegation of Iraqi
atrocities in the war.
   A U.N. report released Monday concluded that Iraq had made
repeated and extensive use of the outlawed weapons. Iraq has
admitted using chemical weapons but denies the latest charge.
   In a letter Thursday, Velayati accused Iraq of ``blatant
disregard'' of the appeals made by the secretary-general and
Security Council for an end to chemical weapons use.
   He said that on Tuesday at 2:45 a.m. local time, Iraqi planes
dropped eight bombs containing mustard gas in Oshnaviyah, a town in
West Azerbaijan province.

   President Oscar Arias hinted
Thursday that he may seek Latin American support for a new
diplomatic and economic initiative against Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government _ ``the bad guys.''
   Speaking to a small group of foreign reporters in his office,
the Costa Rican leader said that Central American countries not in
compliance with his year-old peace plan ``should be punished.''
   Arias said he would not issue his own full assessment of the
peace plan until after he meets with fellow Latin American
presidents at the inauguration of Ecuador's president-elect,
Rodrigo Borja, in Quito next Wednesday.
   But he added, ``My new initiative is to convince the other
democracies that we must put pressure on the Sandinistas'' to
comply with the peace plan signed by Nicaragua and the other four
Central American nations on Aug. 7, 1987.
   Arias declined to elaborate.
   At the time the plan was signed, Arias said he would ask the
Organization of American States and the United Nations to apply
economic sanctions against any country later found not to be in
compliance. The plan was to have taken effect last November.
   The plan calls for talks aimed at ending civil wars in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala and measures toward
democratization in all five countries. Arias won the 1987 Nobel
Peace Prize for authoring the plan.
   Arias acknowledged that none of the five countries, including
his own, is in full compliance, but reserved his strongest
criticism for Nicaragua. His words were couched in perhaps the
strongest language he has used against the Managua government to
date.
   ``The Sandinistas today are the bad guys, not the good guys,''
Arias said. ``They have unmasked themselves. They have proven to
the world that there is no political will in Managua (to comply
with the accord). They were not really honest when they committed
themselves to democratize and to advance toward a pluralistic
society.''
   Arias referred to the arrest last month of about 40
anti-Sandinista protesters; the temporary closing of the opposition
daily newspaper La Prensa and indefinite shutdown of the Roman
Catholic radio station, and the expulsion from Nicaragua of U.S.
Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats.
   Arias said he opposed any further U.S. military aid to the
rebels known as Contras who have been trying to overthrow the
Managua government for the past seven years. He said he had no
objections to humanitarian aid.
   But Arias said any Nicaraguan government ruled by the Contra
leadership would likely be as bad as the Sandinista regime. The
Contras ``are not part of the solution,'' he said, ``they are part
of the problem.''

<HEAD>Art Carney in a Brotherly Reunion on `Cavanaughs'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Art Carney and Barnard Hughes, a couple of Irish
actors who never had acted together before but who look enough
alike to be brothers, are now playing brothers on ``The
Cavanaughs.''
   After a year and a half on hiatus, the CBS series returns Monday
night with a plot-packed, sometimes touching half hour. Hughes
plays Pop Cavanaugh, who unlovingly refers to his brother as ``the
weasel.'' Carney appears only in the first of eight new episodes
ready to air. He hopes to be in more after the writers' strike ends.
   In 1986, Carney's daughter praised ``The Cavanaughs,'' so he
watched. ``I went after the part; I've never done that before. I
called up my agent and said, `If the brother ever shows up, I'd
love to take a crack at it.'''
   ``I used to mention him occasionally,'' Hughes said. ``There was
no brother in sight until you suggested it.''
   Carney shot one episode in February 1987. The new one was shot
in January.
   The hard-working Hughes traveled from Montreal where he's
shooting a CBS movie, ``Day One,'' for a day of ``Cananaughs''
promotion. Carney, who is semiretired, came from his home on the
Connecticut shore.
   Interviewing the pair is more like eavesdropping. They
reminisce, compare notes and update family news, much like
brothers. Both married years ago, stayed married, have children.
Carney has six grandchildren, Hughes none.
   The conversation drifted to remembering names of actors on
radio's long-ago ``It Pays To Be Ignorant.''
   ``This is why I love for you to come on the set,'' Hughes told
Carney.
   TV's Cavanaugh brothers are two years apart, which is close to
life. ``I'll be 70 in November,'' said Carney. ``I'm 73 since July
16,'' said Hughes.
   ``Bob Moloney (writer and producer) captures the flavor of the
Irish so beautifully,'' Carney said. ``The humor of the Irish is
all there; the stubborn qualities come through. He's Irish himself,
which helps. This show wasn't too schmaltzy. It was beautifully
written.''
   ``That's one of the saving graces of the show. It never goes too
far in that area,'' Hughes added.
   Hughes' parents were born in Ireland. Carney's connections are
more complicated: ``My mother's name was Fleming. Her mother was a
Farrell. My grandmother on my father's side was a Quinn. My wife's
a Myers, a little bit of several things.
   ``All my sisters and brothers married Irish. My wife, Helen
Stenborg, is Swedish. I try to get her to use Helen Hughes when she
acts, but no go. She wanted me to change my name to Stenborg.''
   ``My wife's not in the business,'' Carney said. ``We went steady
four years in high school. They don't use that expression any more.
We met in 1936 in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and got married in 1940.''
   ``Helen and I went steady four years, too,'' Hughes said. ``We
got married in 1950. You were very precocious, weren't you?''
   At the time, Carney recalled, he worked for Horace Heidt's band.
   ``I got a break. I auditioned and joined him eight months out of
high school,'' Carney said. ``I did imitations of FDR, Al Smith,
Wendell Wilkie, Winston Churchill, Fred Allen, Jimmy Durante,
Edward G. Robinson and Ned Sparks, a sour-faced comedic actor in
motion pictures. When I was a kid I said to my folks, `I can sound
like Ned Sparks.'
   ``Thank God for FDR. That was my break getting into radio
acting. I did `Report to the Nation' Sunday nights at CBS. I would
do a live impersonation of Roosevelt, quoting from his speeches. I
got confidence in myself, to do some soap operas, `Gangbusters,'
`Counterspy.' That was a nice way to make a living.''
   ``I never did any radio,'' Hughes said. ```Da,' the stage play,
was like radio. You'd sit on these steps and people would imagine.
When we did the picture, I sat on the real mountain and looked out
over the real Irish sea.
   ``My friend over here, Arthur Carney, came to see `Da' with his
wife Jean and forgot to wear his hearing aid. He didn't hear a
word. That's the first time we met.''
   ``I had to go back to say hello and tell him how wonderful he
was in a great play,'' Carney said.
   ``That's when I realized what a phony he was,'' said Hughes, who
won a Tony in 1978 for ``Da.''
   With Carney, the conversation inevitably turns to his role as Ed
Norton on ``The Honeymooners' with Jackie Gleason, and Hughes
obliged by asking what it was like to work with the late ``Great
One.''
   ``I started with Gleason in 1950. A couple of writers suggested
me,'' Carney said. ``Gleason didn't know me from a hole in the
ground. I knew him from `The Life of Riley.' He did that before
(William) Bendix.
   ``I never thought Norton should have been married. He would
drive Ralph mad because he had a different girlfriend every night.
   ``I still have the hat Norton used to wear. I got that hat at
Edson-Lewis Men's Shop in Mount Vernon when I was in high school,
for $5. I thought I was springing for a nice hat. It paid the bills
for a good number of years.''

<TEXT>
   It was 1966 and Joe Mintz was 48, a very
successful Dallas life insurance salesman with a growing income and
an expensive house. Then he became an industry critic, a very
successful one.
   His later success is not in financial terms, however. The big
house, for example, was sold and he and his wife live in a much
smaller apartment now. He lost a lot of his old insurance industry
buddies, too.
   And much of the time, he concedes, his ideas have simply bounced
off the industry's tough hide. He talks of the frustration in
obtaining understanding of his causes, but far less action.
   But, he says, ``I wake up every morning knowing it will be a
good day.'' He always sounds it, too. Though a very severe critic,
and greatly upset by some life insurance practices, he retains an
outwardly serene demeanor.
   Part of it comes from experience, since Joe _ with his computer
printouts _ was an important factor in developing Individual
Retirement Account legislation, some of which, to his chagrin, has
since been rescinded.
   Now 70, collecting Social Security and a small amount from his
nearly inactive agency, he continues to argue that the life
insurance industry, by choice, fails to describe its products in
ways most beneficial to customers.
   At his own expense he attends insurance meetings, sometimes as a
speaker. He needles state regulators. He grabs the attention of
consumer advocates and legislators. He produces stacks of data and
analyses from his computer.
   While he is respected in the industry for speaking his mind, he
is feared, too, since he calmly strikes at some of the industry's
most respected tenets, even some of its moral precepts, and does so
in plain, flat-out language.
   At his own expense, for example, he has just designed, written,
printed and published a four-page memorandum called ``How To
Discover Your Gold Mine,'' in which he assaults the dictum that you
should never trade in your life insurance policy.
   To the contrary, he says, it is often in your best interest to
do so. All at once, he says, you might release thousands of dollars
in cash for your own use, retain or improve your coverage and pay
no further premiums.
   Here is an example:
   The original life insurance policy would pay the beneficiary
$100,000 upon death of the insured. It required an annual premium
to the insurance company of $1,430. The policy contained $18,700 in
cash value.
   It was discontinuued, and three new policies purchased:
   1. Using the $18,700 cash from the old policy, a new $96,000
policy became available, with no further premium payments required.
   2. Using $715, one-half of the annual premium saved by switching
policies, a new, additional, $15,000 policy was purchased and made
payable to the original beneficiary.
   3. Using the remainder of the saved premium, $715, a second
$15,000 policy became available, with benefits assigned to a home
for the aged.
   In this scenario, which is constructed from actual marketplace
data, the original $100,000 payable at death increases to $126,000.
   This, and other situations he describes, document the title of
his four-page memo, available from Gold Mine, Box 12066, Dallas,
Texas 75225. For $2, he will send two copies for review by you and
your insurance agent.
   Joe has a particular reason for suggesting you ``liberate'' your
funds. ``Since rewards are common when one recovers a possession
thought lost forever, you may be willing to share these gains with
a deserving organization.''
   Such liberated money, he says, could be contributed to a church,
synagogue, nursing home, hospital, school, home for the aged or a
charity of your choice, including yourself. Share with them, he
says, rather than with the insurer.
   Theoretically, he says, billions of dollars could be shared with
needy institutions _ he does not consider the insurers to fit the
category _ if people examined their policies.

<HEAD>Analyst: Drought Led to `Hype and Sophistry' About Greenhouse
Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This summer's drought has focused more
attention on the ``greenhouse effect,'' but an agricultural analyst
says it's impossible to predict whether the Grain Belt will be
among the early losers from a global warming.
   In an article published by Resources for the Future and the
National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, Norman J.
Rosenberg also cautions against prematurely adjusting U.S.
agriculture to cope with potential changes in the climate.
   ``One cannot rule out the possibility that some lands now too
arid for cultivation of food crops may indeed become more usable
for these purposes in the future,'' writes Rosenberg, director of
the climate resources program for Resources for the Future, an
independent research and education group.
   ``However, there is no more evidence to support that assumption
than there is to support the idea, popularized by the media, that
productive lands in the U.S. Midwest and Great Plains are certain
to become drier and less productive.''
   Still, Rosenberg strongly suggests that some agricultural
efforts be vigorously continued as precautions against possible
problems. He also says more research is needed to develop
techniques to help farming prepare for the natural ups and downs of
climatic variations.
   ``There is nothing in the predictions of the climate change
community to suggest that we should reduce emphasis on soil and
water conservation programs,'' he writes.
   Rosenberg was a professor of agricultural meteorology and
director of the Center for Agricultural Meteorology and Climatology
at the University of Nebraska before joining the Washington-based
organization last year.
   ``The conservation reserve program and sodbuster provisions are
likely to be needed as much in the future as they are today,'' he
writes.
   ``Conservation of groundwater should be emphasized, especially
in aquifers, like the Ogallalla, that are only slowly rechargeable.
Vast quantities of water in storage may provide a buffer to lessen
the negative impacts of greater aridity in the mid-latitudes of
North America, should climate change occur as some global climate
models suggest.''
   The Ogallala covers portions of Great Plains states from
Nebraska to Texas and is primary source of irrigation for farming.
   In an interview, Rosenberg expressed concerns that the current
drought gripping portions of the Grain Belt has generated ``hype
and sophistry'' about the greenhouse effect _ that increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases would cause a
general warming of the atmosphere by trapping heat around the Earth.
   Rosenberg contends the drought shouldn't be blamed on the
greenhouse effect but is a product of natural variations in weather
patterns.
   However, he says the drought should serve as a lesson for policy
makers and as an indicator of the kinds of severe weather changes
that could occur more frequently in the future if the greenhouse
effect manifests itself as some have suggested.
   ``I think the people who are using this year's drought as some
kind of omen of the greenhouse effect are doing us a bit of a
disservice ... because this drought is not at all unprecedented,''
says Rosenberg. ``But the drought does drive home the point that
we're very vulnerable and climate change can make us more
vulnerable.''
   Rosenberg says he is ``reasonably convinced'' that the
greenhouse effect is responsible for the gradual warming trend that
has occurred worldwide. But he says scientists lack the ability to
accurately predict the regional effects of a continuation of that
warming. Past greenhouse effect studies have predicted widely
ranging temperature and precipitation changes.
   For example, a ``state-of-the-art'' study by the Energy
Department in 1985 projected temperature increases for the middle
of North America from 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius, depending
upon which scientific model was used by researchers.
   In his article, Rosenberg says there are indicators that
agriculture can adjust to some of the predicted climatic changes.
He points to the expansion of the nation's winter-wheat growing
region since 1920.
   Hard red winter wheat is grown in the northern Plains, including
Montana, where average temperatures are lower, the growing season
shorter and there is less rainfall than traditional areas like
Kansas. That expansion, Rosenberg says, ``has occurred over a
climatic gradient greater in many ways'' than the greenhouse
changes predicted in some studies.
   Still, Rosenberg says the current drought illustrates how modern
agriculture remains extremely vulnerable to weather-related
stresses. He contends that more emphasis should be placed on
research to develop crops and ``techniques that minimize that
vulnerability.''
   That, he says, is the best strategy for agriculture to prepare
for what the greenhouse effect could bring.
   ``Even if the whole greenhouse effect would turn out to be a
misconception, but we had invested a lot more in research to
fortify agriculture against climatic variability, natural
variability, we'd still be coming out ahead,'' says Rosenberg.

<HEAD>Platform To Champion Bush's Pet Issues _ Drug, Education, Child
Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican leaders say their 1988 platform
will hew closely to the conservative lines of their 1984 model on
taxes, defense and the deficit, while adding new language on drugs,
education, child care and other issues George Bush hopes to
champion.
   Bush will seek to put his personal stamp on the platform Monday
when he journeys to New Orleans to testify before the platform
writers a week before the opening of the Republican National
Convention.
   He has signaled that he wants this platform to echo most of the
positions the party took in 1984, when Republicans in Dallas
categorically rejected any tax increases, endorsed a line-item veto
and balanced budget amendment, eschewed an Equal Rights Amendment
and promised to appoint judges at all levels ``who respect
traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.''
   The Democrats approved a 5,200-word platform at their convention
last month after rejecting minority planks calling for higher taxes
on corporations and the wealthy and for a pledge not to be the
first to use nuclear weapons.
   President Reagan has accused the Democrats of trying to hide
their liberal positions in ``a plain brown-wrapper platform'' that
skirts any mention of how to pay for the ideas the Democrats
support.
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the Republican party chairman, said in a
telephone interview from his Lake Tahoe, Nev., home, ``I do not see
at this point in time any major platform fights shaping up.''
   Calling the platform ``the soul of the party,'' Fahrenkopf
promised, ``we intend to be specific on the issues and not to try
to mislead the American people with a piece of puff.''
   New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu, a close Bush adviser and
platform committee member, said the Republicans need to update
their plank on arms control, and give added emphasis to such issues
as education, the environment and child care.
   Charles Black, the Bush campaign's platform liaison, said, ``The
vice president and the leadership of the platform committee are in
agreement that we ought to use the '84 platform as a guiding
document, update it, but keep most of the principles in it.''
   ``AIDS wasn't even in there in '84,'' said Black, who added that
he expects the Republicans will have more to say this time about
the war on drugs.
   By testifying in person, Bush is sending a message that ``unlike
(Michael) Dukakis, who's ducking the issues, we are running on the
issues,'' Black said.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr is chairman of the 106-member platform
committee, or the Committee on Resolutions as it is known in
official GOP convention parlance. Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin and
Rep. Jerry Lewis of California are co-chairmen and New Jersey
Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick is vice-chairman.
   Donald J. Devine, head of an ad hoc conservative coalition
called the Committee to Save the Reagan Platform, said,
``Everything seems to be going in the direction that we want.''
   He predicted the platform will strongly support the Strategic
Defense Initiative and the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, and take a
hard line against abortion.
   Devine said writing the plank on AIDS ``might be a problem, not
ideologically but just the complexity of the subject.''
   But ``as far as we're concerned, things seem to be going on
track,'' said Devine. ``If there's any trouble, it will probably
come from the moderates' side, not the conservatives.''
   There were no minority planks at either the 1980 or 1984 GOP
conventions that nominated Reagan and Bush.
   In 1984, a handful of liberal Republicans on the platform
committee, led by Sen. Lowell P. Weicker of Connecticut, were
unable to muster the 27 committee votes needed to press floor
fights on such issues as the Equal Rights Amendment. Weicker is on
the platform committee again this year.
   A New Jersey congressman, James Courter, said he will press for
adoption of a civil rights plank committing the GOP to ``end racial
discrimination wherever it exists.''
   Courter wants to see a landmark 1976 civil rights case, Runyon
V. McCrary, transformed into law. The Supreme Court recently
stirred a controvery when it voted 5-4 to reconsider that case,
which guaranteed the right of minorities to sue over discrimination
in housing, jobs and other areas.
   The Republican platform writers will get a staff-produced
distillation of views that committee leaders heard at hearings in
Washington, Kansas City, Mo., and Los Angeles over the past 4{
months.
   But that is ``merely giving them a piece of paper to work
from,'' not a proposed draft like the Ted Sorensen-written document
that the Democrats worked from, said Barbara I. Pardue, the press
secretary for the GOP convention.
   The committee will vote on a proposed platform by Friday, or
Saturday if necessary, then formally approve it Monday after the
convention opens and submit it to an up-or-down vote by the entire
convention Tuesday.
   Each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico places one
man and one woman on the committee; Guam and the Virgin Islands
send single representatives.
   Fahrenkopf, whose party produced a 32,000-word platform in 1984,
said there is ``no way'' the Republicans will produce a document as
short as the Democrats'.
   But he added, ``I would hope that we can say it shorter than
32,000 words.''

<HEAD>Dollar Generally Higher In Thin Trading, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly against all major
currencies except the British pound in late-morning trading today
in Europe. Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Milan said the market remained
essentially bullish on the dollar but predicted no major change in
its position until Friday's release of the U.S. unemployment rate
for July.
   One trader said he expected the unemployment rate to rise to 5.4
percent from 5.3 percent in June, but said that would still
represent a very low jobless rate and proof of the current strength
of the U.S. economy.
   ``Think back to the dire predictions about a recession made in
the October (stock market) crash. It makes you appreciate how well
the U.S. economy is doing now,'' the trader said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 132.75 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 132.93 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.8759 West German marks, up from 1.8755; 1.5645
Swiss francs, up from 1.5635; 6.3255 French francs, up from 6.3235;
2.1163 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1150; 1,383.65 Italian lire, up
from 1,382.00; 1.2040 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2020.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7125 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7090 late
Wednesday.
   Bullion dealers said gold and silver were trading in a narrow
range with no apparent direction.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $433.60 a troy ounce, up
from late Wednesday's $432.25. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $433.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $433.60, down from $434.00 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.67 to close at a bid $435.34.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.86 a troy
ounce, down from Wednesday's $6.88.

   The dollar edged down against the yen today in
Tokyo, while share prices closed lower in moderate trading.
   The dollar opened at 132.75 yen, eased in slack, tight-ranged
dealings before edging up to close at the day's high of 132.75 yen,
down 0.10 yen from Wednesday's finish.
   Spot trading totaled a thin $1.98 billion, down from Wednesday's
$2.72 billion.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
17.88 points Wednesday, shed 55.79 points, or 0.20 percent, closing
at 28,292.66. Declining issues outpaced advancers 524 to 343, while
177 others remained unchanged.
   Volume in the first section was a moderate 800 million shares,
unchanged from Wednesday's total.
   Share prices firmed in early trading but fell back in the
afternoon when oil shares, higher at the end of the morning session
on a flurry of merger rumors, yielded most of their gains, dealers
said.
   Financial issues also fell, dragging down the index, they added.
   Rumors of tightened margin trading requirements sidelined some
investors, said a dealer at a major securites firm.
   ``If the exchange tightens control on margin trading, prices of
large-capital shares, which have been leading the market in recent
days, are bound to decline,'' he said, speaking anonymously.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they expect the U.S. unemployment
rate for July, scheduled for release Friday, to remain around 5.3
percent, the June level which was the lowest since May 1974.
   If the unemployment figure falls, it would boost the dollar,
they said.

   Eastern Airlines executives say they may
appeal a federal judge's order temporarily blocking the carrier
from slashing its operations and laying off 4,000 workers.
   In a ruling that put into disarray the company's plans to prune
its operations Aug. 31, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker
agreed Wednesday to a request by Eastern's unions to block the
cutbacks temporarily.
   He tentatively scheduled a hearing for today at which the
duration of the court's red light will be discussed. On Wednesday,
he issued a temporary restraining order, which usually lasts no
more than 10 days.
   On July 22, the financially reeling airline announced plans to
lay off 12 percent of its 32,200 workers and eliminate 140 of its
1,225 daily flights.
   Eastern would end almost all operations at Kansas City, Mo., its
main hub in the western United States, dramatically reduce service
at its eastern hub of Philadelphia and eliminate flights to 14
cities. The airline would focus its service on the East Coast and
Latin America.
   David Boies, an attorney for Eastern, said it would be ``a
prescription for disaster'' for the airline to consider continuing
its operations in Kansas City.
   Another Eastern lawyer, Michael Madigan, said Eastern lost $68
million in Kansas City last year and $33 million in the first three
months of 1988. In all, he said, the airline has lost more than $1
billion since 1980, including $194 million in 1987 and $31 million
in the first quarter of this year.
   ``We are continuing to suffer heavy financial losses and
therefore we will give an appeal immediate and serious
consideration,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said when the
session ended.
   Lawyers for the three unions representing Eastern employees,
however, insisted that the cutbacks were just the latest in a
series of efforts by the company to weaken labor by shrinking the
airline.
   ``They're engaged in a plan designed, if they don't get from
labor what they want, the ultimate demise of Eastern,'' said Robert
A. Burka, lawyer for the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers, representing baggage handlers and other
ground workers.
   The airline is engaged in contract talks with the machinists and
with the Air Line Pilots Association and has made it clear that it
is seeking reductions in wages.
   Management has proposed a series of sales of Eastern assets in
recent months to other subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp., which is
also Eastern's parent company. Unions have claimed that
management's goal is to strip Eastern and shift business to
Continental Airlines, a Texas Air subsidiary that is non-union.
   Labor already has blocked one such proposal in court _ a plan to
sell the airline's profitable shuttle serving the Northeast.
Eastern executives have argued that the deal would have produced
cash for the carrier.
   Joseph Guerrieri Jr., another attorney for the machinists, told
Parker that union lawyers had uncovered a ``smoking gun'' Eastern
memo laying out the company's plans to sell assets and containing
estimates of how damaging each deal would be to labor.
   The plan to sell the shuttle, for example, was described as
having ``maximum shock value'' on the unions. The document was
submitted to Parker under seal.
   Boies conceded that the memo had come from management, but he
told the judge that ``most of what's talked about there was never
done.''
   During the 3{-hour hearing, lawyers for the machinists, the
pilots and the Transport Workers Union _ which represents flight
attendants _ argued that federal labor laws and the unions'
contracts forbade cutbacks without bargaining.
   Company attorneys claimed that such paring is allowed, and that
they occur all the time.
   ``Hubs have been opened and closed in the airline industry since
deregulation very frequently,'' said Madigan, referring to the 1978
law that diminished the federal government's role in overseeing air
service.
   But when the session ended, Parker said that ``a sufficient
threat of injury to the unions ... exists, which in the judgment of
this court warrants issuance of the temporary restraining order.''
   According to the company, the layoffs would include 1,000 flight
attendants, 1,000 baggage handlers and other ground workers, 1,000
non-unionized workers, 500 management and supervisory jobs and up
to 500 pilots.
   In Miami _ where Eastern is headquartered _ the flight
attendants proposed a plan Wednesday that would use job-sharing and
leaves to save their jobs. The company rejected the plan, saying it
would cost more money.

   Hollywood erupted in joy when negotiators
announced a tentative settlement of the 150-day-old writers' strike
that has affected everyone from TV stars to delicatessen owners to
television viewers.
   Wednesday's announcement of a settlement between the Writers
Guild of America and the producers' alliance signaled an end to
what had become one of the longest strikes in modern Hollywood
history, surpassed only by the guild's 1960 walkout of five months.
   ``It's been a very, very difficult summer for all of us, because
nobody has been in control of this,'' said producer Stephen J.
Cannell. ``I'm glad there's a solution now, or appears to be. I got
the 3-in-1 Oil out and my typewriter is ready to go.''
   ``As a responsible human being, I'm thrilled it's over,'' said
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, who wrote all 22 episodes of her
``Designing Women'' series last season. ``On a personal level, I'm
getting real attached to my hammock.''
   ``I am relieved that the strike is over _ and so is my family. I
can start earning some money again. I have two assignments that I
am waiting to complete,'' said I.C. Rapoport, who wrote the CBS
television movie ``Cook and Peary: Race To The Pole''
   Besides writers and producers, the walkout hurt restaurant
owners, talent agencies, performers awaiting work and ordinary TV
viewers.
   The starting dates for the fall season were left in question as
the strike ate into the first month of the normal production
schedule.
   Most producers estimated they could get shows on the air in
six-eight weeks after a settlement.
   ``We're all champing at the bit to go back to work,'' said
actress Betty White of NBC's ``The Golden Girls.''
   CBS could begin broadcasting new shows the third week of
October, Kim LeMasters, president of CBS Entertainment, said
shortly before announcement of the settlement. Returning shows and
half-hour comedies were most likely to hit the air first, followed
by new, hourlong dramas, he said.
   ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard said a contract
would leave his network ``able to premiere most of our fall
schedule either before, after or combined with (the miniseries)
`War and Remembrance' in November.''
   Stoddard said premiere dates would be announced soon. ABC
already said it would delay its premieres until after NBC's
combined fall schedule of the Summer Olympics and World Series had
ended, but left in question when the new season would actually
start.
   Many people dependent on business from the film and television
industry felt the strike's impact.
   Newt Bellis, president of Unitel, a major post-production
operation on the lot of Paramount studios called his losses
``dramatic.''
   ``We dropped to a third of what we projected for May, June and
July,'' he said.
   ``I hope it's not too little, too late. I hope that we can swing
into action soon enough to retain some of the (television) season.''
   Unitel, which handles editing and sound dubbing for such shows
as ``Family Ties,'' also has offices in New York and Pittsburgh.
   Bellis said television commercial work at the Eastern offices
kept the Hollywood plant afloat during the strike, but he still had
to dismiss a few workers.
   During frequent and lengthy bargaining sessions at the producers
alliance headquarters, both sides snacked on trays from Art's Deli
in Studio City, a major schmooze-and-deal eatery.
   But even that high-ticket account of hungry negotiators failed
to make up owner Art Ginsburg's losses as regular customers
tightened belts.
   ``We had to let three employees go, and now we will be able to
pull them back,'' said an ecstatic Ginsburg on Wednesday.
   Ginsburg said business was down 20 percent, and orders were down
by 100 dozen bagels, 100 pounds of cream cheese and 150 dozen eggs.
   At the William Morris Agency, one of the industry's oldest and
largest talent houses, agents were told to hold down costs during
the strike, said Roger Davis, executive vice president and a member
of the board of directors.
   ``We tried to cut expenses on a voluntary plan,'' he said.
``There were less luncheons, less general entertainment, cheaper
wine, whatever.''
   The agency managed to avoid lay-offs and kept active with deals
on concerts, books and personal appearances, which do not depend on
guild-written scripts, said Davis.
   ``But the tendency of big buyers to get motion picture rights to
the more expensive books fell off, because people were not willing
to expend large amounts of money without knowing how long this
would go on,'' said Davis of the strike.

   Share prices were slightly higher on London's
Stock Exchange around midday Thursday in narrow, featureless
trading, with many players absent due to the summer holiday season.
   Dealers said the market's near-term direction was uncertain,
with the few players left in the market adopting a wait-and-see
attitude, probably until Friday's release of U.S. jobless data for
July.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 3.1
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,868.2 at about 12:15 p.m., its best
level for the day.
   The index opened little changed and then moved down as much as
1.5 points to its lowest level of the day before climbing into
positive territory.
   Volume was a scant 269.8 million shares, compared with 244.8
million shares at the same time Wednesday.
   Dealers said the New York market's performance Wednesday, which
saw the Dow Jones industrial average advance only 2.85 points to
2,134.07, gave little direction for the London market.

<HEAD>Newspapers Report Wall Street Indictments Near</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal government is on the verge of
issuing racketeering indictments against a senior employee and a
former employee of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., as well as several
employees of a New Jersey investment firm, according to published
reports today.
   The reports in the Wall Street Journal and the Baltimore Sun
said attorneys for the likely defendants characterize the charges
as largely technical and based on an unprecedented use of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
   The attorneys told the Sun that prosecutors are trying to coerce
testimony against ``bigger fish'' at Goldman Sachs & Co. and
Drexel, firms with which the New Jersey firm, Princeton-Newport
Partners L.P., had dealings.
   Princeton-Newport, based in Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach,
Calif., specializes in hedge transactions, aimed at profiting from
the spreads in the prices of convertible stocks and debentures.
   The Journal identified one of those expected to be indicted as
James Sutton Regan, a general managing partner of
Princeton-Newport, along with three or four general partners. It
quoted Regan's lawyer, Theodore Wells, as saying his client is
innocent and will vigorously contest any charges that may be filed.
   The Journal said two people employed at Drexel at the time of
the transactions are also expected to be charged: Bruce Newberg, a
former trader in Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office who
recently left the firm, and Cary Maltausch, a current employee of
Drexel's New York office.
   Spokesmen for Princeton-Newport and Drexel were said to be in
meetings Thursday morning and not immediately available for comment.
   If the grand jury votes an indictment, Princeton-Newport would
be the first securities firm ever charged as a racketeering
enterprise, but would probably not itself be named as a defendant,
the Journal said.
   Drexel itself is not expected to be charged with any wrongdoing,
the Journal said. Drexel's junk bond division, which has
revolutionized Wall Street in the 1980s by dramatically increasing
the reach and implications of corporate debt, has been the focus of
extensive government probes.
   The indictment reflects a significant escalation in tactics used
by the government to prosecute Wall Street executives.
   Under the criminal RICO law, passed in 1970 to combat organized
crime and drugs, a person or business that commts two or more
felonies as part of a pattern can be charged with racketeering.
   The law carries severe penalties, including as much as 20 years
in prison and the confiscation of property and earnings, even if
they are unrelated to wrongdoing.
   ``The Department of Justice is threatening to chop off feet to
get what they want, regardless of whether it's true,'' Paul Grand,
attorney for Charles Zarvecki, general partner and head of trading
of Princeton-Newport, told the Sun.
   ``Rudolph Giuliani (the U.S. attorney for the Southern District
of New York) believes the threat of racketeering charges is so
potent that its use will bring anyone to his knees.''
   The Sun said the case centers on three charges.
   The first involves complex tax issues arising out of the hedging
techniques used by Princeton-Newport. Specifically, it concerns how
losses were recognized.
   The second revolves around alleged ``parking'' in Mattel stock.
In 1984, Princeton-Newport bought a position from Drexel of between
0.5 percent and 1 percent of the Southern California toymaker's
stock, which it sold back to Drexel in 1985. Stock parking is when
one holds a stock for another to conceal the true ownership.
   The third charge is likely to be based on the contention that at
the behest of Drexel employees, Princeton-Newport tried to
manipulate the price of C.O.M.B., a company that deals in
distressed merchandise.

<HEAD>Ford Official Says Automaker Modernizing 15 Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will spend nearly
$3.5 billion to modernize 15 North American assembly and
manufacturing plants and may build new plants as part of an
expanded product investment plan, Ford Vice Chairman Harold A.
Poling says.
   ``We are building on our product successes and following a
strategy of step-by-step improvements at existing facilities,''
Poling said Wednesday at the University of Michigan's Management
Briefing Seminars.
   He said the company will decide by the end of the year whether
demand for its vehicles justifies adding new plants.
   Ford has sought to conserve cash and cultivate employee goodwill
in the past five years by renovating existing facilities rather
than building at new, empty, ``green field'' locations.
   ``But when you've reached a point where you see a sustained
demand for your products above that which you could provide on the
basis that we've been providing, then you've got to consider a
green field site,'' Poling said. ``And we will; we're looking at
it.''
   The improvements are part of a worldwide five-year investment
plan that will see the automaker spend significantly more than the
$16.6 billion spent during the previous five-year period, Poling
said.
   Eight of the 15 improvements under way or scheduled to begin
this year are at plants in Michigan. Scheduled to be modernized
are: Livonia transmission; Dearborn assembly, Romeo engine; Wayne
stamping, assembly and the truck plant; Wixom assembly; and
Ypsilanti.
   Other plants to be updated are: St. Louis assembly; Louisville
assembly; Buffalo, N.Y., stamping Plant; Lorain, Ohio, assembly;
Walton Hills, Ohio, stamping; Sharonville, Ohio; and Connersville,
Ind.
   ``We believe our modernized plants are state-of-the-art, and we
are gaining productivity advantages with very efficient
investment,'' Poling said.
   Since introducing its 1985 models, Ford has increased its annual
North American assembly capacity by 500,000 units. Greater line
speeds, additional work shifts and the upgrading of equipment
contributed to the increase in productivity, Poling said.
   Ford reported record profits of $1.66 billion in the second
quarter of 1988, company officials said.
   Poling said investment alone is not the way to make sure profits
increase, adding that the automaker must also follow a three-part
agenda.
   ``One, and this can never be overemphasized, we must continue to
focus on the basics. Two, we must accept change and deal with it in
new, more imaginative and more efficient ways. And three, our
industry and government must work more cooperatively and
effectively to achieve mutual goals,'' Poling said.

<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC said Thursday its
first-quarter profit fell 9 percent from a year earlier, hurt by
its acquisition of loss-making British Caledonian Airways.
   British Airways' net profit for the first quarter of its fiscal
year, ended June 30, fell to 53 million pounds, or about $91
million, from 58 million pounds, or about $99 million. Per-share
profit declined to 7.4 pence, or about 13 cents, from 8.1 pence, or
14 cents.
   Revenue rose 13 percent _ to 1.02 billion pounds, or around $1.7
billion, from 900 million pounds, or $1.5 billion.
   The results, while lower than those for the previous fiscal
year, exceeded most analysts' expectations.
   British Airways shares were trading at 159 pence, or $2.72, up 2
pence, on the London Stock Exchange at mid-morning.
   Results for British Caledonian, which British Airways acquired
for 253 million pounds, or around $433 million, in April, were
included in the latest quarter's figures, but not in those of the
previous year.
   British Caledonian posted losses in its final years as an
independent airline. British Airways, which was recently privatized
by the government, is expected to take some time to return those
operations to profitability.
   Passenger loads on former British Caledonian flights are still
well below British Airways' standards, said Lord King, chairman of
British Airways.
   For the combined company, average passenger load factor, or the
percentage of seats filled, dropped to 66.2 percent from 71.4
percent.
   ``British Airways' performance has been close to target and
within the (former British Caledonian) operational area we have
taken a firm control of costs,'' King said.
   Analysts said they expect the benefits of acquiring British
Caledonian's routes to be reflected in British Airways' earnings
next year.

<HEAD>Chairman Says Four IBP Plants Pass Safety Inspection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four of IBP Inc.'s meat-packing plants passed
detailed safety and health inspections by state and federal
officials, IBP Chairman Robert L. Peterson said in the company's
1987 annual report.
   Those inspections resulted in ``no headlines,'' Peterson said,
in contrast to big headlines that followed allegations in July 1987
by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   OSHA levied a $2.59 million fine at IBP's Dakota City
headquarters plant, alleging that IBP did not report worker
injuries there.
   ``We are vigorously appealing OSHA's Dakota City record-keeping
assessment, which we believe is in error,'' Peterson said. ``We
expect to be vindicated.''
   ``IBP works hard to safeguard its employees,'' the report said.
``We will put our track record on the line against any other
meatpacker in the country. It is a matter of common human decency
to be concerned about the safety of employees. In addition, it
happens to make good business sense.''
   Unions representing IBP workers have long contended the
company's plants are unsafe.
   The inspections the four plants passed included safety practices
and employee protection during actual operations, Peterson said.
   The annual report was the first by the company since its stock
became available for public ownership last October. Occidental
Petroleum Corp. had owned IBP for six years and retains a 50.5
percent ownership.
   The report said a seven-month labor dispute last year at the
Dakota City plant had a satisfactory resolution but, together with
start-up costs for three new pork plants, cost the company nearly
$20 million.
   The strike ended with an eight-year labor agreement Peterson
said will stabilize the company's labor situation.
   ``We regret the continued confrontations at Dakota City,'' he
said. ``However, we have the obligation at IBP to manage for the
long-term, profitable growth of our business. This will ultimately
benefit our employees as well as our stockholders.''
   He said the company had pre-tax losses of $4.9 million in 1987
from starting operations at new pork facilities at Louisa County
and Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Madison. The plants now are
profitable and are expected to be major contributors to IBP's
earnings growth, he said.

   The stock market advanced broadly today, aided
by falling interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.51 to 2,139.58 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 620 up, 268
down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.58 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets today, leaving yields
on long-term government bonds just a shade above 9 percent.
   Wall Street has been looking ahead with some trepidation all
week to the government's report Friday on the employment situation
for July.
   The talk has been that the figures will show continuing strong
growth in payroll employment, thus giving the Federal Reserve
another reason to consider tightening credit.
   But today, traders apparently came to the conclusion that stock
prices had already taken into account the prospective negative
implications of the news, and focused instead on the idea that
corporate earnings and dividends would also be robust.
   Philip Morris, which raised its dividend, rose | to 92~.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, American Express gained

   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, said
it has set up a joint venture in the Philippines that will produce
6,000 passenger cars a year by 1990.
   A Toyota official said Thursday that Toyota Motor Philippines
Corp. has been created in Manila, the Philippines capital. The new
company has total capital of 220 million Philippine pesos, or about
$9.8 million. It is owned 60 percent by a group led by Metropolitan
Bank and Trust Co. of the Philippines, 25 percent by Toyota and 15
percent by Mitsui and Co., a leading Japanese trading company.
   ``An early production start-up date is hoped for, however at
present it has not yet been set,'' the Toyota official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The new company has purchased an idle plant of the former Delta
Motor Co., a Philippine automaker, from the Manila government for
130 million pesos, or about $5.9 million. It plans to equip the
facility with Toyota's modern production equipment, the official
said.
   He said the joint venture has a production target of 500
passenger cars a month by 1990 and plans eventually to make
commercial vehicles at the Manila plant.

   A union leader says the International Union
of Electronics Workers and Chrysler Corp.'s Acustar Division have
reached a precedent-setting contract that calls for job security
and a new plant in the Dayton area.
   The statement released this morning by Wes Wells, president of
IUE Local 775, provided few details. It said the five-year contract
would be signed later today, subject to ratification by the local's
members Friday.
   The Dayton Acustar plant, which makes heating and cooling
products, employs approximately 2,000 people.
   Wells said that if the contract is ratified it will provide for
the future job security of the Dayton plant.
   His statement said the Dayton plant would receive ``preferential
provider corporate status'' that would give it the edge over other
suppliers in providing new parts for Chrysler.
   The agreement also calls for a second Acustar plant to be
located in the Dayton area, the statement said. No details were
provided on possible employment or production capabilities for such
a plant.
   Local 775 will have exclusive bargaining rights at the new
plant, the statement said.

   Scriptwriters say they can probably start
work on a delayed fall TV season by next week, giving viewers hope
of relief from reruns after a tentative agreement to end the
22-week strike by 9,000 writers.
   Leaders of the Writers Guild of America voted late Wednesday to
urge union members to accept the proposed contract, despite what
union negotiators acknowledged were concessions on key issues.
   ``Thank God! Isn't that wonderful news? We're all champing at
the bit to go back to work,'' said actress Betty White, the
Emmy-winning star of NBC-TV's ``The Golden Girls.''
   The settlement announced Wednesday signaled the end to one of
the longest and most painful strikes in modern Hollywood history,
surpassed only by the guild's 1960 walkout, which lasted 23 weeks.
   One Hollywood agent predicted a flood of work from writers who
have been forbidden by strike rules to submit scripts to producers.
   ``It will be weird for a few weeks. There will be such a rush to
the marketplace, such an overabundance of material, that it will
confuse the studios,'' said Martin Bauer of the Bauer, Benedeck
Agency.
   Despite the settlement, the start of the fall TV season will be
delayed, perhaps until November. Costs to the networks will be
extraordinary, and could range into tens of millions of dollars.
   Writers estimated their losses were in the millions of dollars
and thousands of people employed in all parts of the entertainment
industry suffered layoffs because of production shutdowns.
   The dispute reached beyond writers, actors, directors, editors
and stage hands Hollywood's ancillary industries, including
equipment rental and film processing.
   Restaurants popular in the entertainment industry had to lay off
waiters, business at dry cleaners, hair salons and messengers
slowed. Even the commissary at Universal Studios was closed because
of lost income.
   George Kirgo, president of the guild's West Coast unit, said the
leadership voted 25-6 to recommend that the rank-and-file ratify
the contract. One member abstained. If the union members approve
the pact when they vote Sunday, they could return to work by
Monday, Kirgo said.
   ``It was time to bring it to a conclusion and the deal was
there,'' said chief union negotiator Brian Walton.
   ``We are very pleased to have reached a tentative agreement,''
said Nicholas Counter III, chief negotiator for the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers. ``No one wins a strike.''
   But one guild negotiator, Del Reisman, acknowledged ``very mixed
feelings'' about the settlement. He said the writers failed to
achieve one of their key aims, a substantial improvement in payment
for reruns of television shows broadcast in foreign markets.
   However, guild leaders feared that prolonging the strike and
longer could weaken the union, said Reisman, vice president of the
West Coast guild unit.
   The guild did win improvements in creative control over scripts
and the re-acquisition of original screenplays, he said.
   ``We wound up with an equation that was actually less than most
of us hoped for,'' Reisman said. ``But it is the first improvement
in 18 years.''
   The settlement came after a collapse of talks last weekend
produced two days of intense efforts by a variety of
intermediaries. Contract issues were resolved during a 12-hour
meeting between Walton and Counter.
   Reisman said guild leaders instructed Walton on Monday to ``go
out and get a deal and make it the best that you can.''
   The guild, which began the strike March 7, has 9,000 members,
most in Southern California. The alliance has 217 member companies
responsible for 85 percent of network prime-time television and 90
percent of feature film production and distribution.
   Losses to guild writers were estimated at $500,000 each strike
week, and the guild paid out more than $2 million in hardship loans
to its members.
   CBS could begin broadcasting new shows the third week of
October, Kim LeMasters, president of CBS Entertainment, said
shortly before announcement of the settlement.
   ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard said a contract
would leave his network ``able to premiere most of our fall
schedule either before, after or combined with (the miniseries)
`War and Remembrance' in November.''
   ABC already said it would delay its premieres until after NBC's
combined fall schedule of the Summer Olympics and World Series had
ended, but left in question when the new season would actually
start.
   NBC had no immediate comment.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Aerostructures has received its
second big European Airbus award in three months, a $500 million
contract to build wing components for commerical jetliners,
officials said.
   ``The capture of this contract helps solidify our position in
the commercial aircraft industry worldwide,'' said John S. Kleban,
president of Texron Aerostructures.
   Textron Aerostructures, a subsidiary of the Providence,
R.I.-based Textron, was selected by Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm's
Transport Aircraft Division to build wing parts for the European
Airbus A330 and A340 program. MBB is West Germany's largest
aerospace company.
   The award makes Textron Aerostructures the major U.S. supplier
for the A330 and A340 series of Airbus commercial jetliners.
   Airbus Industrie, based in Toulouse, France, is a consortium of
Europe's largest aircraft makers.
   On May 12, Textron Aerostructures announced another $700 million
Airbus wing component contract from British Aerospace.
   The contracts, however, will replace relatively few of the 4,400
jobs lost at the Nashville plant since 1986, after the completion
of the B-1B and Lockheed's C-58 program, the company said.
   Under the MMB contract, Aerospace will provide engineering
design support, development, tooling and production of outer flaps,
spoilers and flap track fairings.
   The agreement will require Textron to invest $3 million in
equipment to produce the wing components. Production deliveries are
scheduled to begin in early 1991 and build to a rate of seven
assemblies per month by October 1993.
   The A330 is a twin-engine airliner with a high seating capacity
for service on medium- and long-range routes of up to 5,100
nautical miles. The A340 is a four-engine widebody with a range of
up to 7,850 nautical miles. Both aircraft have identical wings and
systems.

   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to the National
Weather Service's forecast for hot, dry conditions in the Midwest
during most of next week.
   Reports of some new wheat sales to China and India added support
to the wheat market in early trading, analysts said.
   Traders shrugged off predictions of scattered showers today and
Friday in the Farm Belt, where drought-stressed soybean crops are
struggling to produce and fill bean pods.
   The precipitation is expected to come from the same storm system
that dropped widely varying amounts of rain Wednesday in southern
Minnesota and northern Iowa.
   ``It's not going to rain all that much, maybe a quarter-inch to
an inch with about 40 percent coverage, so most places won't get
any rain,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Traders focused on the weather service's latest 6-to-10 day
forecast for above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall in

   That was enough to spark a brief flurry of buying in the stock
market, but the advance didn't last long.
   Wall Street has been looking ahead with some trepidation all
week to the government's report Friday on the employment situation

   The talk has been that the figures will show continuing strong
growth in payroll employment, thus giving the Federal Reserve
another reason to consider tightening credit.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were higher in mostly quiet trading
early today, as the market awaited Friday's government report on
the nation's unemployment in July.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was up ] point, or
$3.75 for every $1,000 in face value, by midday. Its yield, which
moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest
rate trends, fell to 9.04 percent from 9.06 percent late Wednesday.
   Analysts said bond prices were lifted on a wave of buying early
in the trading session.
   ``We had a big flurry for the first 10 minutes and we've been
asleep ever since,'' said Jay Goldinger, a principal of Capital
Insight Inc., an investment firm in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Many investors were caught short after selling bonds Wednesday
on speculation that the jobless report for July would show a strong
growth in the number of employed, analysts said.
   Higher employment tends to depress bond prices because it
implies a stronger economy, rising wages, greater demand for credit
and inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues edged up 1-32 point to 1-16 point, intermediate
maturities rose 1-16 point to 5-32 point, and 20-year issues gained
5-16 point, according to data provided by Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was up 1.59 at 1,143.05.
   In corporate trading, industrial bonds rose. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, edged up
0.71 to 285.04.
   Three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, slipped 1 basis point to
a discounted rate of 6.86 percent and a yield of 7.07 percent.
Six-month bills declined 2 basis points to a discounted rate of
7.07 percent and a yield of 7.42 percent, while one-year bills were
down 1 basis point at 7.29 percent to yield 7.81 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 7} percent, up from 711-16 percent late
Wednesday.

   Some 2,600 rail workers went on strike after the
morning rush hour today but were back on the job two hours later,
in time for the evening commute, after Congress quickly imposed a
cooling-off period.
   The strike against the Chicago and North Western Transportation
Co. idled 4,900 other union workers who honored picket lines in
Chicago, Kansas City and otrher sites, and halted service in
Chicago and elsewhere in the Midwest.
   The railroad serves 41,000 commuters a day in the nation's
third-largest city and moves freight on 6,400 miles of track in 10
Midwestern states.
   The strike by 2,600 members of the United Transportation Union,
originally scheduled to begin shortly after midnight, was delayed
several hours after C&NW agreed to postpone the elimination of the
jobs of 1,156 train brakemen.
   The brakemen and conductors went back to work shortly after
Congress, on a unanimous voice vote, passed a bill extending a
cooling-off period in the dispute to Sept. 9.
   The plan had been worked out among representatives of the
railroad, the union and members of Illinois' congressional
delegation.
   Sen. Paul Simon and Rep. Terry Bruce, both Illinois Democrats,
said they expected President Reagan to sign the measure this
afternoon.
   During the cooling-off period, the union may not strike and the
company is prohibited from eliminating any jobs, Bruce said.
   The dispute centers on a C&NW plan to cut most of its train
crews from four to two workers.
   Donald Markgraf, general chairman of the railroad workers union,
said he supported the extended cooling-off period and was
optimistic the dispute could be resolved.
   ``I think there should be more time to negotiate this issue,''
Markgraf said. ``All disputes have got to be resolved some day. I'm
not trying to start strikes.''
   Some commuters faced delays up to 15 minutes today because of
vandalism to signal equipment, said James Foote, a spokesman for
CNW Corp., the railroad's parent company. Foote refused to
speculate on who may have caused the damage.
   Commuters were relieved that the strike was delayed until after
rush hour.
   ``I would have had to take two buses and an el train to get to
work,'' said Duane Stewart, a purchasing manager, adding that it
would have taken him an extra hour. ``I was really not looking
forward to this morning.''
   In April, Reagan issued an executive order barring either side
from taking action until 30 days after a presidential emergency
board submitted recommendations for a settlement.
   The presidential board recommended last month that C&NW cut one
brakeman per train, as a compromise, and that elimination of the
second should be decided through binding arbitration on a
train-by-train basis.
   The railroad initially rejected the proposal, but then offered
Monday to accept it in hopes of averting a strike. Union officials
rejected that offer.
   ``We're not optimistic anything will change,'' said CNW
spokesman Fred Bloedorn. ``But we've agreed to give it a chance.''

   Share prices rose Thursday on the London Stock

financial institutions.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 4.6
points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,869.7, just below the day's high of
1,870.5 at early afternoon.
   Trading volume rose to 472.3 million shares, compared with
Wednesday's 416.1 million shares.
   A handful of stocks were active on takeover speculation, dealers
said, but most issues were fairly inactive.
   Some dealers said they detected a greater amount of
participation by institutions and funds. But one salesman said,
``They're still mainly sitting on their hands.''
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 6.5 points at 1,508.5
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.95 points
to close at 1,067.23.

   The magazine, to be called Sports Illustrated for Kids, will be
targeted to children age 8 and older and has two aims, the
announcement said.
   ``The editorial purpose will be to emphasize the enjoyment that
exists in all sports, whether the reader is a participant or
spectator,'' said Mark Mulvoy, managing editor. ``In the process,
it will improve reading, learning and socialization skills.''
   The magazine's initial circulation of 500,000 will be equally
divided between paid home subscriptions and distribution to 2,500
schools participating in the Sports Illustrated for Kids literacy
program, the announcement said.
   Sports Illustrated, which is published by Time Inc., said it has
lined up 20 of a hoped-for 36 corporate sponsors. Each of the
sponsors will make an annual commitment of $250,000 and receive 10
pages of advertising and participation in the literacy program.

   The House today passed the only tax bill
Congress is likely to consider this year, a relatively modest
effort that offers relief for a variety of special interests and
tax increases for others.
   The vote was 380-25, with solid support from both parties. The
bill now goes to the Senate.
   ``This bill is in keeping with the spirit of tax reform''
enacted in 1986, said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee. He noted the bulk of the new
legislation aims to correct errors and clear up confusion in that
new law, which lowered tax rates and increased income subject to
taxation.
   The bill would provide special breaks for rural mail carriers,
free-lance writers, first-time homebuyers and farmers and other
off-road users of diesel fuel.
   To pay for those tax reductions, the bill would put the bite on
pipe smokers, defense contractors, corporations that own other
corporations, some farmers, and certain people who claim deductions
for maintaining an office in their home.
   At 960 pages, the bill is almost as lengthy as the landmark 1986
law. But in dollar terms, it is one of the smallest pieces of tax
legislation in recent years. The Joint Committee on Taxation
estimates it would cut taxes by about $7.1 billion through 1991 and
raise taxes by about $47 million less.
   In the Senate, the Finance Committee has produced a much leaner
version. The Senate measure contains little more than corrections
of the 1986 errors and the diesel-fuel provision demanded by
farmers.
   Because of the need to fix some ambiguities in the 1986 law, the
Reagan administration wants to see the bill enacted this year, as
do accountants and other tax professionals.
   Here are some of the provisions in the House bill:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _A tax exclusion for the first $1,500 a year of employer-paid
educational assistance for undergraduate study would be renewed for
1989 and 1990; it expired in 1987.
   _Farmers, construction companies and other off-road users of
diesel would be exempted from paying the federal tax of 15.1 cents
a gallon; present law requires them to pay it and apply for a
refund at year end.
   _Owners of mutual fund shares would be exempted permanently from
paying tax on a share of the fund's operating expenses, retroactive
to Jan. 1.
   _A credit for owners of low-income rental housing would be
extended through 1990.
   _A tax exemption for interest on bonds sold to help low-income
families buy their first home would be extended through 1990.
   _A credit for research and development would be extended two
years, through 1990.
   _Rural mail carriers who use their own cars would be allowed to
deduct 33.75 cents per mile, which is 150 percent of the standard
mileage deduction.
   _Free-lance writers, photographers and artists would be exempt
from a rule requiring that certain production expenses not be
deducted until a project produces income.
   _Similarly, some livestock producers would be exempt from that
rule, as would growers of pistachio nuts.
   _None of a home's basic monthly telephone charge could be
deducted as a business expense; this could affect many people who
work second jobs out of their homes.
   _A person could take a deduction for 80 percent of a
contribution to a college athleti scholarship program, even if that
gift carries the right to buy preferred seating for games.
   _A new tax of $2.67 would be imposed on a pound of pipe tobacco.
   _The completed-contract method of accounting would be repealed,
raising taxes on defense contractors and large construction
companies.
   _Depreciation for farm equipment would be slowed.
   _The deduction for dividends received by a corporation that owns
less than 20 percent of another would be reduced.
   _Tax advantages of single-premium life insurance would be
reduced.
   _Corporations that use an annualized method of calculating
estimated tax payments would have to accelerate their payments.
   _A special tax break designed to help Alaska Native corporations
by permitting them to sell unused tax benefits would be repealed on
grounds it has been abused.

<HEAD>Chubb Buys Newspaper Ad in Drought Insurance Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE MADER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chubb Group of Insurance Cos. purchased
newspaper advertising space across the nation Thursday to repeat
its denial that it reneged on a drought insurance offer to farmers
in the parched Midwest.
   Chubb said it is cooperating with state officials investigating
complaints stemming from a dispute in which its Warren-based
subsidiary, Federal Insurance Co., is accused of backing off a
promise tn issue policies that pay off if rainfall is below a
certain level.
   ``Recently, because of issues related to the `rain insurance'
controversy, our reputation has been under public attack for the
first time in our history,'' said Chubb's full-page advertisement
that ran in more than 30 newspapers and various publications around
the country.
   Chubb says the policies were sold through an agent for Federal
Insurance, and expected they would offer about $30 million in total
coverage. But the agent, Good Weather International, received more
than 8,700 applications for drought coverage totalling $370 million.
   Chubb's ad details how the controversy developed and said a
flood of 6,000 applications in the final days of the enrollment
period exceeded the amount of policies it wanted to sign. As a
result, the company said it could not fill all the applications.
   ``We said that applications were not binding on Chubb until
accepted, and that premiums must be submitted with applications
because of the short-term nature of the policy,'' Chubb's ad says.
   ``It's not unusual in the agricultural business for applications
to accompany a premium check because of the short duration of the
coverage,'' said Mary Lu Korkuch, a company spokeswoman. ``It's not
like homeowners insurance, which is a continuous renewal type of
policy.''
   Farmers in 10 states _ Ohio, Minnesota, Indiana, Iowa, Illinois,
Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee and Wisconsin _ applied for
the insurance as they contend with one of the worst dry spells in
history. Some have filed lawsuits against the company over the
disputed insurance, and state officials also have threatened legal
action.
   ``Unfortunately, much of what you may have read or seen about
Chubb and `rain insurance' in recent weeks is misleading and a lot
is simply wrong,'' the ad says. ``Because that information goes
directly to our reputation for keeping our word, which is
fundamental to the product we sell, we must set the record
straight.''
   Chubb had spoken with 5,000 farmers as of early Thursday and had
plans to talk with the other 3,711 who applied for the insurance by
the end of the week, Ms. Korkuch said.
   ``Out of 5,000, there have been five people who have refused to
deal with us. ... Of course, we're very encouraged by that,'' she
said.
   After talking with state insurance commissioners, Chubb
announced in mid-May that it would issue a total of $40 million in
drought coverage, $10 million more than it had initially planned.
   But that was expected to cover only 10 percent, or about 800, of
the farmers who had applied, the company said. Six-thousand others,
who did not receive coverage, would get twice the amount of their
premium returned, Chubb has said.
   So far, 600 policies have been issued, and 70 farmers have asked
for the double premium payment, Ms. Korkuch said.
   G. Terry Van Gilder, deputy chief underwriting officer for the
group, told a state insurance hearing Wednesday in Ohio that Chubb
didn't realize Good Weather oversold Chubb's drought insurance
until one day before the deadline for applications.
   Chubb said in its newspaper ads that its decision to return
premiums ``was made as soon as we knew how oversubscribed Good
Weather's program was.''
   The advertisement offered no new proposals from the company, but
said, ``We intend to continue to deal fairly and responsibly with
the farmers involved.''
   Ms. Korkuch said the company based this year's total coverage
estimate on last year's application response. Chubb received 1,000
applications and issued $5 million in coverage in 1987, the first
year the drought insurance was offered, she said.
   Chubb had sold $15 million in drought coverage _ one-half of its
maximum for the insurance _ by June 12, but the amount applied for
had risen to $370 million three days later, Van Gilder said.

<HEAD>FCC Proposes Eliminating Network-Cable Cross-Ownership Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday revived a proposal to allow national television networks
to own cable TV systems.
   The FCC originally proposed eliminating the network-cable
cross-ownership rule in 1982, but never acted on the plan.
   The rule was adopted in 1970, when the cable TV industry was in
its infancy, because of fears that the TV networks would buy up
cable systems and control their programming.
   The FCC noted that a report by the Commerce Department's
National Telecommunications Information and Administration in June
recommended the rule be abolished. The report said the TV networks'
influence has diminished significantly since the rule was adopted.
   The agency's three sitting commissioners voted unanimously to
seek comment again on the proposal to update the record so the
agency can consider eliminating the rule. But one commissioner
expressed reservations.
   Commissioner James H. Quello said he feared that without rules
requiring cable systems to carry local broadcast signals, a
network-owned cable system could disadvantage the local competition
by dropping the stations from its cable menu.
   Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said he doubted that a network-owned
cable system would risk alienating viewers by dropping a popular
channel from its line-up. ``It would be an economic disincentive,''
he said.
   James P. Mooney, president of the National Cable Television
Association, said the commission's proposal to eliminate the rule
is ``reasonable'' because conditions have changed so much since
1970.
   The FCC also proposed scrapping a rule that limits the term of
affiliation agreements between networks and stations to a maximum
of two years.
   This rule was adopted nearly 50 years ago for the radio industry
and then applied to TV in 1945 as a way to assist new networks in
gaining access to broadcast outlets.

   A major trade bill awaiting President Reagan's signature was
labeled protectionist on Thursday by several of America's leading
trade partners, who warned that the legislation could harm
international relations.
   The Senate approved the bill Wednesday by an 85-11 vote. The
measure, aimed at reviving U.S. competitiveness abroad, cleared the
House of Representatives earlier, and President Reagan has
indicated he will sign it.
   Reagan vetoed a previous version of the bill in part because it
contained a controversial plant-closing notification requirement.
Earlier this week Reagan decided not to veto a separate
plant-closing bill.
   Major U.S. trading partners stated their opposition to the trade
bill's provision that would make it easier for the U.S. government
to impose import curbs in retaliation for alleged unfair trading
practices by other nations.
   Many of the nations that complained the bill is protectionist
are accused by the United States of being protectionist themselves
for using high tariffs, quotas or other barriers to imports.
   In the Far East, where the reaction was mostly negative, the
leaders of Japan and South Korea urged Reagan to veto the bill.
   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said, ``I think it's
unfortunate, because (the bill contains) protectionist overtones.''
   Trade Minister Hajime Tamura said Japan would monitor
implementation of the bill to ensure it did not violate
international trade regulations.
   Although the United States has registered trade deficits with
each of East Asia's most powerful economies _ Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan and Hong Kong _ its biggest concern lies with Japan. Last
year, $60 billion of the $170 billion U.S. trade deficit lay with
Japan, which has been the target of previous retaliatory sanctions.
   South Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying it
deeply regretted the bill's passage and called for its elimination.
   ``It is the strong hope ... that the U.S. administration will
once again demonstrate its firm commitment to free trade by taking
appropriate measures not to allow such a protectionist bill to be
enacted,'' the ministry said.
   Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade said it was ``gravely
concerned'' because the bill ``indicates the United States is going
to move away from free trade and move to the practice of
protectionism.''
   The bill extended the definition of unfair trade to the areas of
exchange rate, trade surplus, labor rights and copyright
violations, the statement said.
   In Europe, West Germany's economics minister, Martin Bangemann,
said the bill ``could turn out to be a strong burden on free
international trade.''
   He appealed to the Reagan administration to implement the
policies outlined in the trade bill ``with as much restraint as
possible.''
   Even before the Senate vote, Britain's Financial Times said in
an editorial that ``trading partners of the United States have
reason to be nervous.''
   ``In their future dealings with the U.S. administration, they
will almost certainly have to accept that it is armed with a tough
new mandate to promote U.S. exports by systematically forcing open
foreign markets under threat of sanctions,'' the newspaper said.
   The British government had no immediate comment.
   Only officials in Hong Kong officials took a more positive view.
   Tony Miller, Hong Kong's acting trade director, said the British
colony welcomed the bill ``to the extent that (it) will reduce some
of the pent-up protectionist pressures in Congress.''
   But Hong Kong officials also expressed concern about a provision
calling for an investigation into unfair trade practices by foreign
nations.
   The bill also would bar Japan's Toshiba Corp. from selling goods
to the U.S. government for three years as a penalty for a
subsidiary's export of high-technology milling machines to the
Soviet Union.
   The 50 percent-owned subsidiary, Toshiba Machine Co., also would
be prohibited from selling products commercially in the United
States for the same period.
   Joichi Aoi, president of Toshiba Corp., said it was unacceptable
that the U.S. government planned to punish a foreign company that
had not violated any American laws.
   A company spokesman also quoted Aoi as saying it was improper
for the United States to impose a punishment for a past event with
a new law.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated
Toshiba Corp. would suffer direct losses of about $50 million a
year, while indirect damage would be ``substantial.''

   The stock market pulled back a bit today after
an early advance faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 5 points
in the early going, was off 5.16 at 2,128.91 by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 599 up, 728 down and
577 unchanged.
   Interest rates fell in the credit marets today, leaving yields
on long-term government bonds just a shade above 9 percent.
   That was enough to spark a brief round of buying in the stock
market, but the advance didn't last long.
   Wall Street has been looking ahead with some trepidation all
week to the government's report Friday on the employment situation
for July.
   The talk has been that the figures will show continuing strong
growth in payroll employment, thus giving the Federal Reserve
another reason to consider tightening credit.
   GTE climbed ~ to 41{ in active trading. The company raised its
dividend and announced plans to buy back as many as 25 million of
its shares.
   Insilco gained 2 to 29\. The company agreed to be bought out by
a group including its top executives for $29 a share.
   Philip Morris, which raised its dividend, rose [ to 92].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.31 to 153.72. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.07 at 305.27.

   Corn and soybean futures closed sharply higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade on prospects for continued
hot, dry weather in the drought-stricken Farm Belt.
   Wheat and oat futures also advanced but not as strongly as corn
and soybeans, which soared their permitted daily limits late in the
session before profit-taking trimmed the gains, analysts said.
   The markets had opened higher in reaction to the National
Weather Service's 6-to-10-day forecast for above-normal
temperatures and below-normal rainfall next week in the Midwest,
where stunted soybean plants are struggling to produce and fill
bean pods.
   Morning forecasts for scattered showers late Thursday and Friday
had kept tight reins on the early rally.
   But at midday some private meteorologists reduced the amount of
rain in their near-term forecasts, triggering an explosion in
demand for corn and soybean contracts.
   ``The main influence was those weather forecasts for the next
few days,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.82{ a bushel; corn was {
cent lower to 7 cents higher with September at $3.04{ a bushel;
oats were 2{ cents to 4 cents higher with September at $2.86 a
bushel; and soybeans were 7{ cents to 27{ cents higher with August
at $8.63 a bushel.

   Assets of the nation's 446 money market mutual
funds fell $1.66 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $264.7 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $325.6 million drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 220 general purpose funds fell $314.2 million to $82.89
billion, assets of 101 broker-dealer funds dropped $1.33 billion to
$113.1 billion, and assets of 125 institutional funds declined $14
million to $68.73 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.95 percent from 6.91 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 6.83 percent from 6.77
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
35 days, the same as the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.82 percent as of Wednesday from 5.81 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.38
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.33 percent
the previous week. Yields were 7.67 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
7.62 percent; 8 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.98 percent; and
8.37 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.35 percent.

<HEAD>Quarterly Decline in Productivity Biggest Since 1981</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 11th graf bgng: Meanwhile, the ... to CORRECT first
quarter to second quarter. Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business productivity in the second quarter
deteriorated at a rate unequalled since 1981, the government
reported Thursday, prompting some analysts to predict major
troubles ahead for the economy's competitive vigor.
   The efficiency of non-farm businesses in producing goods and
services declined 1.7 percent in April through June, its first
decrease since 1986 and the biggest decline since 1981, the Labor
Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
   Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the
first three months of 1988, and had been improving at a rate of 1
percent to 2 percent annually in the previous three years.
   Reflecting the strong economic expansion, output of goods and
services by those businesses responsible for three-fourths of U.S.
economic activity rose 4.7 percent in the second quarter
   But to achieve that growth, companies increased their work hours
by 6.5 percent, hiring hundreds of thousands of new employees to
send the unemployment rate to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent.
   ``To some extent the job growth is coming at the expense of
productivity,'' said Larry Chimerine, president of the Wfa Group of
Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``It's the big issue because if this trend
continues, we're not going to see any improvement in living
standards.''
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Bston Co., a New York
consulting firm, said the deterioration in productivity is the
first hard evidence of a shortage of skills among newly hired
workers.
   ``We are scraping the bottom of the barrel, so to speak, of new
labor market entrants whose skills and training may not be
sufficient for using the new data processing and communications
technologies that are dominating service industries,'' Sinai said.
   Calling the development a major change from the past six or
seven years, Sinai said a whole new range of government policies
beyond fiscal and money supply management are now needed.
   ``Literacy, retraining, the ability to work with machines, is
now much more important to keeping inflation down and productivity
up,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said labor costs soared 5.9
percent in the second quarter, the largest gain since a 6.1 percent
increase in the last quarter of 1986, as hourly wages and benefits
rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent.
   After taking into account a 4.4 percent annual rate of inflation
in the last 18 months, workers' purchasing power actually declined
0.6 percent from April through June, the department said.
   ``It's certainly not a sign that wages are accelerating or
causing inflation,'' said Michael Evans, who runs a Washington
economic consulting firm.
   Evans and other private analysts said the quarterly figures are
subject to revision and often fluctuate widely.
   ``If you take the first two quarters together, you have
productivity improving at a rate of about 1.5 percent the first six
months, just like it has for several years now,'' Evans said. ``If
labor costs are rising 2.5 percent to 3 percent and wages are going
up about 4 percent, there is nothing inflationary in it.''
   While businesses generally suffered from poorer efficiency in
the second quarter, manufacturers continued to show improved
productivity, up 3.5 percent from the first quarter.
   Reflecting a boom in the industrial sector spawned by
record-breaking exports, factory production soared 5.4 percent in
the second quarter with only a 1.8 percent increase in the number
of hours worked.
   Manufacturers also were much more successful in holding down
factory wage and benefit increases, allowing annual raises of only
2.9 percent from April through June.
   That enabled employers to reduce the labor costs of each item
coming off their assembly lines by 0.6 percent, even though it
meant their workers took a 1.8 percent cut in purchasing power, the
government said.

<TEXT>
   Insilco Corp. said Thursday its board
approved a management-led buyout offer that values the
high-technology and specialty consumer products company at $950
million.
   The board's action in backing the $29-a-share offer came two
days after the company disclosed that its management was
considering making an offer to acquire the company in a leveraged
buyout.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors typically borrow heavily to buy
out a company and then pay off the debt with the target company's
cash flow or the sale of its assets.
   Insilco officials would not say whether there had been any
outside offers for the company.
   ``It's certainly in the ballpark of what's reasonable,'' said
Arthur M. Stupay, an analyst with Prescott, Ball and Turben of
Cleveland. ``It's a good offer.''
   Stupay said he doubted a better offer would be forthcoming.
   ``I don't think too many people can understand this company,''
he said.
   But in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Insilco rose $2 a
share to $29.25, or 25 cents above the offered price.
   In recent years, Insilco, once known as the International Silver
Co., has restructured itself into an industrial holding company
with operating companies that make products for high-technology
industries and speciality consumer markets.
   Insilco makes Red Devil paints, Rolodex rotary files, metal
cartridges and other projectiles for the defense industry and
Dual-Lite emergency lighting equipment.
   Stupay said management probably made the offer because it was
``frustrated that good earnings did not lead to higher stock
prices. They said if stockholders would not pay higher values, we
would.''
   Under the buyout agreement, the management-led group ISC
Holdings Inc. will pay $29 for each of the company's 25.6 million
shares. ISC Holdings, which also includes certain affiliates of
First Boston Inc., will assume Insilco's debt, giving the deal a
total indicated value of $950 million.
   A cash tender offer will begin within five business days, the
company said.
   On Wednesday, Insilco soared $6 a share in heavy trading
following an announcement that management might attempt a leveraged
buyout.
   In making the announcement on Tuesday, Insilco said there were
no assurances an offer would be made or completed.
   The management group has obtained commitments totaling $960
million to finance the purchase, including $430 million from
affiliates of First Boston.
   In the second quarter, Insilco earned $11.7 million, or 55 cents
per share, compared with $11 million, or 52 cents a share, in the
same period a year earlier. Revenue rose to $196.4 million from
$154.3 million.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended July 25, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,024.6 billion in the week ended July 25 from a revised
$3,023.4 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,822.4 billion from $3,819.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $781.8 billion from a revised $781.3 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $102 million,
compared with a gain of $891 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said discount window
borrowings averaged $648 million a day, down from $710 million.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>

   Bond prices were higher in fairly light trading
Thursday as investors awaited the latest government report on
unemployment.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue, which in the previous
session fell about \ point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount, closed
up $3.75.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 9.03
percent from 9.08 percent late Wednesday.
   Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
attributed the price rebound to speculation that the July
unemployment data, scheduled to be released Friday, would show a
weakening in the labor force.
   Softness in the economy is usually considered bullish for the
credit markets because it lessens the prospects for higher
inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities and
causes interest rates to rise.
   A stable dollar in foreign-exchange trading also lent a positive
tone to bond prices, traders said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose between 1-16 point and [ point, intermediate
maturities were [ point to 5-16 point higher, and long-term issues
were up around ] point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, rose 2.29 to 1,143.75.
   Corporate bonds were higher. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate
Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds
with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.94 to 285.27.
   In the tax-exempt market, general obligation and revenue bonds
were up around \ point from Wednesday, with the average yield down
to 8 percent from 8.02 percent, according to the Bond Buyer index
of 40 actively traded municipal bonds.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.04 percent as the
discount fell 3 basis points to 6.84 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.42 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points to
7.07. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.42 percent as the discount
fell 2 basis points to 7.28 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7 11-16 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday.

   Sales of personal computer software roared ahead
50.3 percent in the second quarter of 1988, belying beliefs that
the industry's growth is dwindling, according to an industry
group's survey released Thursday.
   Sales in North America totaled $922 million in the three-month
period, up from $614 million in the same period a year earlier,
said the Software Publishers Association.
   ``People have alleged that the PC software industry is maturing,
but this data, which surprised ... me, shows that it's nowhere near
maturing,'' said Kenneth Wasch, executive director of the
Washington-based trade group.
   For the first six months of 1988, sales rose 50.5 percent to
$1.82 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.
   The results are based on an analysis of confidential sales
figures submitted voluntarily to the accounting firm of Arthur
Andersen & Co. by most of the major companies in each market
segment. Sales of some medium-sized and smaller companies are
estimated.
   Sales of software for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh grew most
rapidly, nearly tripling to $109 million from $39 million a year
earlier. In contrast, sales of software for the Apple II fell 5.4
percent to $37 million from $39 million.
   In the biggest segment, software for both generations of
International Business Machines Corp.'s personal computers and
compatible machines, sales rose 40.8 percent in the second quarter
to $702 million from $499 million a year earlier.
   There was a 10.6 percent decline in sales of software for
Commodore Ltd.'s 64 and 128 computers, to $20.6 million from $23.1
million.

<HEAD>Soybeans, Corn Soar On Dry Weather Forecasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices rose sharply Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade on prospects for continued hot, dry weather
in the drought-stricken Farm Belt.
   Wheat and oat futures also advanced but not as strongly as corn
and soybeans, which soared their permitted daily limits late in the
session before profit-taking trimmed the gains, analysts said.
   On other markets, cattle futures were up sharply while pork
futures were mixed; orange juice futures surged; coffee sank;
precious metals and energy were mixed; and stock-index futures
retreated.
   The grain markets opened higher in response to the National
Weather Service's 6-to-10-day forecast for above-normal
temperatures and below-normal rainfall next week in the Midwest,
where stunted soybean plants are struggling to produce and fill
bean pods.
   The rally was held in check, though, by morning forecasts for
scattered showers late Thursday and Friday.
   But at midday some private meteorologists reduced the amount of
rain in their short-term forecasts, triggering a buying explosion
in the corn and soybean pits.
   ``Everything took off with a big bang,'' said Jerry Gidel, an
analyst with the G.H. Miller Division of LIT America Inc.
   ``The main influence was those weather forecasts for the next
few days,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Lespinasse said the trading floor was abuzz with talk of reduced
harvest prospects for soybeans, and Gidel said field observers were
reporting further deterioration in the hard-hit corn crop after
five straight days of hot, dry weather.
   An Agriculture Department crop production report scheduled for
release next Thursday is expected to confirm that crop conditions
worsened during July.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents to 2 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.82{ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to
7\ cents higher with September at $3.04{ a bushel; oats were 3
cents to 4 cents higher with September at $2.86{ a bushel; and
soybeans were 5 cents to 27 cents higher with August at $8.62{ a
bushel.
   Cattle futures surged on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with
the October live-cattle contract up the 1.50-cents-a-pound daily
limit in reaction to strong cash prices for fed cattle, analysts
said.
   ``The packers would certainly like to be able to buy cattle
cheaper, but the feedyards are really digging in their heels and
not wanting to sell cattle at lower prices,'' said Charlie
Richardson, an analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock & Co.
   Further support stemmed from expectations that the USDA's
monthly cattle-on-feed report will show heavy marketing activity
and a slowdown in feedlot placements last month, Richardson said.
That report will be released Aug. 15.
   Hog futures were narrowly mixed while frozen pork bellies swung
lower.
   Live cattle were .40 cent to 1.50 cents higher with August at
67.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .70 cent to 1.32 cents
higher with August at 79.50 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent lower
to .45 cent higher with August at 44.77 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to 1.55 cents lower with August at 31.92
cents a pound.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice for September delivery soared 6
cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange in a technical rally
sparked by the contract's opening at $1.905, three-tenths of a cent
above the previous contract high of $1.902, analysts said.
   Tight supplies of Brazilian orange juice continue to provide
fundamental support to the market, said Judith Ganes, an analyst in
New York with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The September orange juice contract settled at $1.950.
   Coffee futures retreated in profit-taking on New York's Coffee,
Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, said Bert Ruiz, coffee broker for Balfour
Maclaine Corp. in New York.
   Coffee for September delivery settled 1.63 cents lower at
$1.1657 a pound.
   Gold futures were nearly unchanged while silver prices rose
slightly in quiet trading on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 50 cents lower to 10 cents higher with August at
$433.40 a troy ounce; silver was 1.4 cents to 2 cents higher with
August at $6.855 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures finished mostly lower on technical factors on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 23 cents
lower with September at $15.03 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent
to .50 cent lower with September at 42.46 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .29 cent lower to .30 cent higher with September at
44.95 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 1.20 points lower at 272.85.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Insider Trading Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel approved legislation Thursday
increasing the penalties for insider trading, holding securities
firms liable in some cases for their employees' violations and
offering a bounty to whistleblowers.
   ``This bill ... represents a powerful congressional assault on
insider trading, a pernicious practice which has undermined the
public trust in the fundamental fairness and integrity of our
securities markets,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the
sponsor of the bill and chairman of the finance subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Securities firms had been fighting the measure but dropped their
objections after Markey agreed in talks late Tuesday to soften some
of the bill's provisions.
   The Securities Industry Association, at a hearing last month,
objected to making companies liable when their employees use
non-public information to profit by trading securities.
   The bill as passed requires companies to have systems designed
to detect insider trading, but it limits their liability to
violations in which they either knew or ``recklessly disregarded''
the facts.
   Brokerage firms were also worried about the bounty provisions,
arguing that they would give in-house compliance officers an
incentive to withhold knowledge of wrongdoing from the firm in
hopes of collecting a bounty later.
   However, according to a Securities Industry Association official
who spoke on condition of anonymity, Markey has agreed to limit the
situations in which a brokerage firm employee could collect the
bounty, which would be capped at 10 percent of any penalty levied.
   Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo of New Jersey, the ranking Republican on
the committee, said the compromise ``provides a substantial
deterrent on insider trading ... without placing an undue burden on
the securities industry.''
   In other provisions, the legislation would:
   _Increase the maximum criminal insider trading fine from the
current $100,000 for individuals and $500,000 for corporations and
partnerships to $1 million for individuals and $2.5 million for
firms.
   _Boost the maximum jail term from five years to 10 years.
   _Create a legal basis for private investors to sue to recover
money lost because of inside trading.
   _Give the Securities and Exchange Commission power to issue
subpoenas and take sworn statements on behalf of foreign agencies
pursuing securities violations. The SEC intends to ask foreign
countries to return the service.
   The bill, adopted by the finance subcommittee on a voice vote,
avoids a controversial question that has held up insider trading
legislation for more than a year: how broadly or narrowly to define
insider trading.
   The offense is currently defined by court and regulatory
interpretation. Securities firms had been seeking a better guide
for determining if a particular activity were illegal. Others
argued that a definition would simply provide ``a roadmap for
evasion.''
   The Senate Banking Committee last week passed a much narrower
insider trading bill, including only the provisions on
international cooperation.
   Markey said he hoped the full Energy and Commerce Committee
could act as soon as next week. If the bill passes the full House,
he said he would seek to include its provisions when the House and
Senate versions are reconciled.
   An aide to Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, said the senator is inclined to favor Markey's
broader legislation.

<HEAD>US Treasury Warns Europeans Against Protectionism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top U.S. Treasury official warned Western
Europeans Thursday that increased protection of European business
against U.S. competition would bring counteraction from the U.S.
government.
   ``The intensification of protectionism in Europe would certainly
evoke a response from the U.S. government,'' M. Peter McPherson,
deputy secretary of the Treasury, told the Institute for
International Economics.
   McPherson will take the place temporarily of Secretary James A.
Baker III if Baker _ as expected _ resigns to run the presidential
campaign of Vice President George Bush.
   McPherson has appeared little in public since he took his job a
year ago. He was previously administrator of the U.S. Agency for
International Development. His speech Thursday was the first major
U.S. government statement on plans for the 12 countries of the
European Economic Community to put an end to all trade barriers
among them by 1992.
   The countries are: West Germany, France, Britain, Italy, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland and
Luxembourg.
   ``Some (Europeans) feel that the pressure of greater competition
within Europe should be mitigated by limiting competition from the
rest of the world,'' McPherson said.
   ``This is the sentiment behind suggestions, such as that made by
one prominent industrialist, that a `protective curtain' be erected
around the the internal market.''
   He did not name the industrialist.
   McPherson's speech was made the day after Congress sent
President Reagan the first big overhaul of U.S. trade policies in
14 years. Reagan is expected to approve it.
   Europeans have criticized the new U.S. trade rules as
protectionist. Among the critics is Sir Roy Denman, the EEC
ambassador in Washington. He attended Thursday's meeting of the
Institute for International Economics, a private group that studies
world issues.
   ``There's a tendency in this country to think of a dear old
kindly Uncle Sam being led by guileful Europeans into a deep pit,''
he told the audience of economists.
   He denied that the Europeans want to freeze the United States
out of their markets.
   McPherson said the Reagan administration favors equal treatment
among all trading partners, rather than deals between pairs of
countries, which is known as reciprocity.
   ``This standard of reciprocity could be applied in a manner that
would discriminate against firms in the United States seeking
entrance into the EEC and against U.S.-owned firms already
operating in Europe,'' McPherson said.
   He suggested that instead of ``reciprocity'' the Europeans adopt
the principle of ``national treatment'' _ giving U.S. firms the
same legal rights that they give firms from one another's countries.

   Ford Motor Co. said Thursday it is recalling
15,000 ambulances to replace faulty engine heater hoses that could
leak or burst and cause a fire under the hood.
   The ambulances to be recalled are mounted on 1983-87 Econoline
E-250 and E-350 chassis and vans, Ford said in a statement.
   ``Because of the high operating temperatures sometimes
encountered in ambulance service, failure of the heater hose could
result in an underhood fire,'' said John P. King, a manager in
Ford's parts and service division.
   ``The likelihood of a fire is increased if the engine coolant
mixture is not properly mixed with water,'' he said.
   Ford will notify the owners of the defective vehicles and make
all needed repairs free of charge, King said.
   Ford also said it will replace radiator caps and mufflers on
ambulances made from mid-1985 through 1987.
   Ford spokesman Chuck Snearly said 21 fires have been linked to
the faulty heater hoses and six fires to the muffler problem. Ford
is not aware of any injuries that have been caused by defects in
the ambulances, Snearly said.
   The Washington-based Center for Auto Safety has said the
ambulances are fire hazards.
   Last year, in response to reports of fuel-system problems that
caused fires, Ford recalled 193,000 1983-87 E-250 and E-350 model
Econoline vans and 16,000 1983-87 ambulances built on the E-350
Econoline chassis.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
Thursday in quiet trading in advance of Friday's scheduled release
of the U.S. unemployment rate for July.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $432.95 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$433.25 an ounce late Wednesday.
   The civilian jobless rate fell to 5.3 percent in June, and many
traders expected it to remain at about that level.
   A decline in the U.S. jobless rate could lift the dollar by
providing evidence of strong growth in the U.S. economy, they said.
But they said central banks would probably sell dollars in that
case to slow the currency's rise.
   In the meantime, Thursday's dealings remained dominated by
technical factors and guesses about the intentions of West
Germany's central bank, which continued to sell dollars.
   ``We're becoming like the stock market. This is summer doldrums,
plus,'' said Garrett Glass, a vice president for foreign exchange
at First National Bank of Chicago. ``We're all just sitting waiting
for inspiration tomorrow during the release of the unemployment
numbers.''
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.7105, compared with $1.7090 late Wednesday. Later in
New York, the dollar rose against the pound. It cost $1.7088 to buy
a pound, cheaper than $1.7123 late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 132.75 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted higher at 132.97 yen. At the end of the
trading day in New York, the dollar rose to 132.98 yen from 132.79.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.87925 West German marks, up from
1.87465; 1.5675 Swiss francs, up from 1.5622; 1.2054 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2036; 6.3390 French francs, up from 6.3215; and
1,386.50 Italian lire, up from 1,382.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8795 West German marks, up from
1.8755; 1.5635 Swiss francs, unchanged; 6.3365 French francs, up
from 6.3235; 2.1230 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1150; 1,387.25
Italian lire, up from 1,382.00; and 1.2055 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2020.
   Gold prices fluctuated in a narrow range.
   At the beginning of the trading day in Hong Kong, gold rose
$1.67 a troy ounce to close at a bid $435.34 an ounce.
   Gold was quoted in London at a late bid price of $433 a troy
ounce, up from late Wednesday's $432.25. In Zurich, the bid price
was $433.50 an ounce, down from $434 late Wednesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $433.40 an ounce from $433.30 Wednesday.
   Silver was quoted late Thursday in London at a bid price of
$6.86 a troy ounce, down from Wednesday's $6.88. On New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $6.855 an ounce
from $6.835 Wednesday.

<HEAD>Treasury Arranging `Bridge' Loan For Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department said Thursday it is
working with debt-troubled Argentina to arrange a short-term loan
of up to $500 million from the United States and other creditor
nations.
   The so-called ``bridge'' loan would allow Argentina to meet
interest payments on its foreign debt, much of it owed to private
U.S. banks, while it negotiates with the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank.
   But, according to a department statement, funds from the
short-term loan, won't become available until Argentina meets
certain requirements under the World Bank's lending program.
   Argentina, which is more than 90 days past due on more than $300
million in payments, has said it cannot afford to make its overdue
interest payments.
   Recently, it has taken measures to cut its budget deficit and
check inflation, running about 20 percent a month. This week, it
declared a three-day bank holiday and devalued its currency.
   ``United States willingness to participate in this effort
reflects support for Argentina's economic reform efforts and the
determination of the government of Argentina to address its
international financial relations in a constructive manner,'' the
Treasury statement said.
   It said the United States is working with other creditor
governments through the Bank for International Settlements, a
clearinghouse in Switzerland for central banks, to formulate the
bridge loan.
   ``These efforts will be fully supported as well by the World
Bank and we expect that they will be supported as well by the
international financial community,'' it said.
   The IMF, in its own statement, said it was ready to start
negotiations with Argentina for a $1.2 billion loan.
   The United States last month offered a similar bridge loan to
Brazil, which is seeking to restore its standing in the
international financial community after declaring a moratorium on
its debt payments last year.

<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp., which earlier this week announced
a joint venture with a Chinese company covering its West Coast
refining and marketing properties, is holding talks on a similar
deal, a spokesman said Thursday.
   The Houston-based energy company negotiating with unidentified
foreign oil producers for the sale of half of its Eagle Point,
N.J., refinery as well as half of its refining and marketing assets
east of the Rocky Mountains, spokesman Jim Bailey said.
   He described the talks as ``preliminary discussions.'' Analysts
speculated the company is talking with Middle Eastern oil concerns.
   Coastal announced in February it wanted to sell half of its
refining interests because of the industry's volatile nature.
   The company has refineries in Eagle Point, Mobile, Ala., and
three Kansas locations; a major refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas;
and an extensive network of wholesale distribution terminals that
are primarily east of the Rockies, Bailey said.
   Coastal announced Wednesday that it signed an agreement with
China National Chemicals Inport-Export Corp., also known as
Sinochem, to form a joint venture for ownership and operation of
Coastal's West Coast refining and marketing properties.
   Coastal officials said the deal gives Sinochem half interest in
the joint-venture company for an undisclosed amount of cash.
   Coastal operations to be assigned to the joint venture include a
refinery in Hercules, Calif.; fuel oil terminals at Los Angeles and
Coos Bay, Ore.; and marketing operations at San Francisco, San
Pedro and Long Beach, Calif., and Portland, Ore.
   Sinochem is a state-owned, international diversified business
corporation of the People's Republic of China in Beijing.
   Coastal is a diversified energy company with total assets of $8
billion and operations in natural gas pipelines, oil and gas
exploration and production, refining and marketing, coal and
trucking.

   GTE Corp. said Thursday its board has
authorized the repurchase of up to 25 million shares of its common

   GTE said the repurchase will be made from time to time on the

plans in 1989 and 1990, the company said.

objective, which is to maximize our shareholders' total return on
their investment,'' said GTE Chairman and Chief Executive Office
James L. Johnson.
   ``These actions are particularly appropriate in light of the
sale of 30.1 percent of US Sprint, announced several weeks ago, and
the elimination of the uncertainity of US Sprint's performance on
GTE's earnings outlook,'' he said.
   GTE announced in July an agreement with United
Telecommunications Inc. that calls for GTE to sell a 30.1 percent
interest in US Sprint Communications Co. to United at book value as
of Dec. 31, 1988. The estimated book value is about $600 million.
GTE and United Telecommunications have owned the long-distance
telephone company equally since July 1, 1986.
   United Telecommunications also has the option of purchasing
GTE's remaining 19.9 percent interest in US Sprint until Dec. 31,
1995. GTE has the option of requiring United to purchase its
remaining interest between Dec. 31 1991 and Dec. 31, 1995.

   A federal grand jury returned the first-ever
racketeering indictment against a group of securities professionals
Thursday, charging six people in a multimillion dollar fraud scheme
involving a New Jersey investment partnership and the Wall Street
firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The 35-count indictment, charging racketeering, conspiracy and
mail and wire fraud, named five top partners and employees of
Princeton-Newport Partners, headquartered in Princeton, N.J., and
Newport Beach Calif.
   It also named a former trader in the high-yield bond department
of Drexel in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   The case, which grew out of the government's widespread
investigation of Wall Street insider trading, is the first to
charge brokerage officials under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organization Act, lawyers said.
   That act, originally intended to fight organized crime and drug
trafficking, carries severe penalties, including up to 20 years in
prison and the confiscation of property and earnings.
   All those charged denied any wrongdoing in statements issued
through their attorneys, who characterized the indictment as a
pressure tactic to get the defendants' cooperation in the insider
trading investigation.
   Named as defendants were James S. Regan, 46, a managing partner
of Princeton-Newport; Jack Z. Rabinowitz, 41, general partner;
Charles M. Zarzecki, 40, partner and chief trader; Paul Berkman,
41, partner and trader in Princeton-Newport Arbitrage Partners, a
subsidiary of Princeton-Newport; Steven B. Smotrich, 33,
comptroller of Princeton-Newport; and Bruce L. Newberg, 31,
securities trader in Drexel's high-yield bond department until
early this year.
   Each was charged with one count of conspiracy, one count of
racketeering and one count of racketeering conspiracy. The five
Princeton-Newport defendants also were charged with 32 counts of
mail and wire fraud. Newberg additionally was charged with 26
counts of mail and wire fraud.
   The charges arose from an alleged scheme involving the bogus
sale of securities between Princeton-Newport and Drexel to create
more than $13 million in phony tax losses and avoid regulatory
disclosure requirements. The indictment also alleges stock
manipulation from July 1, 1984 to the present.
   The indictment alleged that to gain Drexel's assistance in the
bogus trades, Princeton-Newport ``parked'' securities for Drexel to
help Drexel hide certain holdings. The New Jersey firm also aided
Drexel in stock manipulation, the indictment charged.
   ``This harmless activity has been twisted into a RICO charge
solely as a device to bludgeon these reputable people into
testifying against others,'' said Paul Grand, an attorney for
Zarzecki.
   ``We're pawns in a much larger game,'' said Robert Schwartz, an
attorney for Rabinowitz. ``When the elephants fight, it's the ants
that get slaughtered.''
   Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New
York, responded to those allegations in a news conference, saying
the indictment ``stands on its own.''
   ``This is a multimillion-dollar crime,'' said Giuliani. ``It
happened not once, not twice. It was a classic pattern of criminal
activity.''
   But Giuliani declined to say whether any other Drexel officials
or the firm itself would be indicted.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said ``Obviously, today's
indictment of Bruce Newberg, a former employee of the firm, is
deeply disturbing. We have only recently become acquainted with
some fo the allegations in the case. We have been informed by Bruce
Newberg's lawyer that he intends to plead not guilty. It would be
unfair for us to prejudge the case or to comment further at this
time.''
   The indictment also alleged Princeton-Newport conducted
fraudulent trading activity through Merrill Lynch & Co., but
Merrill cooperated fully with the investigation and was not accused
of any wrongdoing.
   The government's investigation of insider trading, which snared
speculator Ivan Boesky in 1986, has been thought to focus more
recently on Drexel and specifically Michael Milken, the head of the
firm's high-yield bond department.
   The indictment does not name Milken, but notes that Newberg
reported directly to the head of the high-yield bond department.
   Defense attorneys alleged the six defendants had been questioned
earlier in the Drexel-related probe, and that the government had
offered to drop the racketeering charges against them if the six
cooperated with investigators.
   Giuliani said he could not comment on that allegation but
rebuked what he characterized as irresponsible statements by the
defense lawyers.
   ``This whole silliness is designed to deflect you from what the
case was all about,'' he told reporters.
   If convicted on all counts, the defendants face 20 years in
prison on each of the racketeering counts, five years in prison on
each of the remaining counts, and $250,000 in fines on each count
for a total of $18.75 million, the government said.
   Also under the racketeering statute, the government could seek
forfeiture of investments and interests of the defendants.

   Venezuelan President Jaime Lusinchi
said Thursday he was sending a mission to the United States to
press for new loans to aid the Venezuelan economy, which is
laboring under the burden of its $34 billion foreign debt and the
drop in world oil prices.
   Lusinchi said the mission headed by Finance Minister Hector
Hurtado was aimed at negotiating the restoration of capital flow
into Venezuela, including new loans.
   The continuing weakness in the market for oil, the nation's
chief export, severely has limited Venezuela's ability to fight an
economic crisis that keeps over 40 percent of the labor force
deprived of full employment.
   ``We understand that the Gordian knot (tying up the Venezuelan
economy) is the foreign debt problem and we have decided to cut
it,'' Lusinchi said in a nationwide television address.
   The mission was expected to meet representatives of creditor
banks early next week in Washington and New York and request up to
$3 billion in loans, an amount intended to offset the balance of
payments deficit calculated for this year.
   Lusinchi spoke in the wake of a record fall by the Venezuelan
currency, the bolivar, triggered by officially denied reports that
the nation was ready to declare a unilateral moratorium on payments
on $20.3 billion of its foreign debt.
   The news was denied emphatically by Hurtado, who labeled as
``irresponsible'' the debt moratorium story printed Thursday by El
Universal, one of the country's most influential newspapers.
   ``This is a totally groundless information,'' Hurtado told a
news conference. ``I want to reiterate that Venezuela, as a serious
nation, will continue abiding by its international commitments as
much as with its plans to look for new loans.''
   Lusinchi said, ``As to this matter (debt) we have not rushed and
will not rush to measures which are not well supported.'' But he
warned that as the oil market goes, so will the country's ability
to repay its creditors.
   Venezuela is Latin America's fourth-largest debtor, after
Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
   Venezuela's financial difficulties have worsened in the past few
months. International monetary reserves at the Central Bank have
been steadily declining from over $9.3 billion in December to $8.5
billion as of June. Of this total, only $2.5 billion are liquid
reserves.
   Lusinchi said Venezuela had agreed on a refinancing scheme with
creditor banks only on condition that the banks grant new loans to
Venezuela. It is widely acknowledged that efforts in that direction
have been almost fruitless.
   Servicing its foreign debt will cost Venezuela over $5 billion
this year. The amount includes more than $4 billion in interest
payments, or nearly 50 percent of the nation's projected total
export revenue for 1988.
   In February 1987, the government signed with creditor banks a
second accord extending up to 15 years, through 1999, the repayment
of the nation's $20.3 billion public sector debt at a lower rate of
interest from the previous accord signed in 1986.
   Lusinchi is expected to confer on the debt issue next week in
Quito with some of his Latin American colleagues scheduled to
attend the inauguration of Equador's new president, Rodrigo Borja.

<HEAD>Farm Lawmakers Produce $3.9 Billion Compromise Drought Package</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf bgng ``President Reagan ... '' to CORRECT
figure to $3.9 billion, sted million.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm lawmakers approved a $3.9 billion aid
package for drought-stricken farmers Thursday night, including a
three-month dairy price-support increase but limiting feed
assistance to livestock producers.
   ``We have moved in record time and we have developed a good,
fair bill,'' Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J.
Leahy, D-Vt., said after the House-Senate conference committee
approved the compromise package.
   Plans call for bringing the bill to the floor in both the House
and Senate by next Wednesday at the latest, and most lawmakers
believe that the election-year package will find overwhelming
support in both chambers.
   President Reagan is expected to sign the measure, whose $3.9
billion cost estimate is well below the $6 billion level at which
the measure could have nasty budgetary repercussions.
   Major provisions would provide farmers with 65 percent of crop
losses beyond 35 percent of the expected harvest. That feature
already was cemented when the conference committee went into
session.
   Farmers very severely hurt by the drought would get even more.
The bill would furnish producers with 90 percent of losses over 75
percent of their expected harvest. That represented a compromise
between the 95 percent level in the House version and the 85
percent level passed by the Senate.
   House and Senate negotiators were unable to agree on much in
sessions Thursday morning and early afternoon. Leahy and House
Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas,
finally went behind closed doors, joined by senior Republicans.
They produced a compromise that was swiftly adopted when the
conference committee met Thursday night.
   They dropped a Senate-passed provision that would provide
government feed assistance to farmers who would not ordinarily be
producing their own feed even if not for the drought. Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng said Wednesday he would have trouble
recommending the feature to President Reagan because the price tag
was $2 billion.
   The compromise version retained a House-passed provision that
would provide assistance to livestock producers who also produce
their own feed. The price tag would be $800 million by
administration estimate.
   The decision to narrow the feed benefits went a long way toward
dropping the price tag to $3.9 billion, well below earlier
estimates of what the final price tag would be.
   Livestock feed has become a key to the drought issue. Heat and a
lack of rain have scorched a substantial quantity of hay and feed
grains in the midcontinent, causing feed prices to shoot up.
   The compromise retained the one major dispute that the conferees
had resolved in their otherwise futile sessions earlier _ a House
provision that would raise the dairy price-support level in April
through June next year by 50 cents to $11.10 for each 100 pounds of
milk.
   In accepting the House plan to raise the support level, Leahy
voted ``aye'' while all of the other Senate conferees remained
silent. The Senate chairman's home state is a major source of the
East Coast's milk supply.
   ``The Senate recedes to the House by one weak aye,'' announced
de la Garza as laughter passed over the scores of agribusiness
lobbyists and congressional staffers in the room.
   But the compromise made substantial modifications in a
Senate-approved provision that would constitute a major benefit for
American manufacturers of ethanol _ ethyl alcohol made from farm
products and mixed with gasoline to form the fuel gasohol.
   As passed by the Senate, the measure would have allowed ethanol
makers to buy 2 million bushels each of surplus corn, or other
crops, each month at 110 percent of the goverment-owned Commodity
Credit Corporation's acquisition price _ well below current,
drought-inflated prices. The total available would have been
limited to 16 million bushels a month.
   Proponents said the plan was designed to boost a number of small
ethanol manufacturers but it could also have turned into a sizeable
subsidy for the Archer Daniels Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill., a
major corporation with a politically active management.
   The final product of the conference committee, however, would
make the program optional and leave the final say-so up to the
secretary of agriculture. ``I don't think it will be put into
effect,'' said Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill., the ranking House
Agriculture Committee Republican.
   The bill also would exclude participation by ethanol producers
that use more than 30 million bushels of corn a year.
   House provisions that would make disaster payments available to
farmers hit by disasters other than the drought, including some
that happened in 1987, also were adopted by the conference
committee. The payments would be for ``drought, hail, excessive
moisture or related condition.''
   The related condition ``includes hurricanes, because they come
with moisture,'' de la Garza said. That resolved a concern of Rep.
Jerry Huckaby, D-La., who raised the issue several times. Hail
payments were designed to compensate cotton growers in the district
of Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, for damage in a storm that struck
last year.
   Administration officials had been opposed to the provision.
   The two houses compromised on a House requirement that farmers
would have to buy federal crop insurance in 1989 and 1990 to
receive disaster payments. Under the legislation, they would have
to buy one year of the insurance if their disaster loss exceeded 65
percent of normal yield.

   A temporary court order against Eastern
Airlines' plans to scrap routes to 14 cities was limited Thursday
to halting 4,000 layoffs when the carrier cited logistical
difficulties with obeying a wider ban.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker ordered Eastern to
suspend plans to lay off 4,000 pilots, flight attendants and other
employees as part of the broader plan to curtail service after Aug.
31, according to union lawyers who attended a closed session with
the judge.
   Parker scheduled an Aug. 11 hearing on a bid by three employee
unions for a preliminary injunction to prevent Eastern from
reducing service by 201 flights per day.
   He also extended the temporary restraining order, which was
issued Wednesday, until Aug. 19.
   In Miami, Eastern President Phil Bakes said in a statement: ``We
are pleased that the court refused to adopt the plaintiffs'
proposed order, which would have been extremely disruptive to the
flying public and the nation's travel agents.''
   Charles E. Bryan, president of Eastern Machinists District 100,
also in Miami, said of the order: ``We had no problems. We were
completely satisfied. It was upholding our positions.''
   The reorganization proposed by the financially troubled airline
also includes plans to close the Kansas City hub and to concentrate
service on the East Coast and to Latin America.
   A copy of Parker's written order, however, was not released by
his chambers and won't be made public until Friday.
   ``He is trying to create a standstill in a way that minimized
the harm to Eastern if they win and minimized the harm to us'' if
the unions ultimately prevail, said labor attorney Robert Burka.
   During a hearing convened earlier in open court, Eastern
attorney Michael Madigan told Parker ``there were numerous
operational difficulties'' to complying with a blanket order to
halt implementation of the schedule changes.
   ``The scheduling of an airline is an incredibly complex problem
that must be done in advance,'' Madigan said at the hearing.
   The temporary restraining order was obtained by the Air Line
Pilots Association, the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers, and the Transport Workers Union. The unions
argued the reorganization violates federal labor law.
   Eastern has already taken steps to implement the new schedule,
which involves allowing pilots to bid on certain flights under
union work rules, Madigan said.
   There are also problems posed by using airport slots and
scheduling maintenance crews, he said.
   Madigan said the airline would be in contempt of Parker's order
if it were required to undo the steps it has already taken to
reorganize its schedule.
   But Eastern was willing to carry the 4,000 employees it wants to
lay off on its payroll while the issue is argued in court, Madigan
said.
   Parker adjourned the hearing to give attorneys for both sides
time to fashion the specific terms fothe order.
   The judge later joined the parties in a discussion in the jury
room behind the courtroom in an attempt to work out a settlement.
   During the session, Parker indicated the terms of the order that
he would issue, according to attorneys who attended the session.
   Before leaving the bench, Parker sharply questioned Madigan
about why at Wednesday's hearing he didn't raise the logistical
problems he was now citing.
   ``Everything went well as far as you were concerned until you
heard the ruling of the court,'' the judge told Madigan.
   ``I frankly was quite surprised by the court's ruling, as you
have known from the look on my face,'' Madigan said, recalling his
expression when Parker delivered his ruling from the bench on
Wednesday.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent,
meanwhile, accused the Eastern unions of waiting until the eleventh
hour to challenge a reorganization that it has known about for
months.
   Speaking at the dedication of a new terminal at Newark
International Airport in New Jersey, he said: ``This schedule, like
all schedules, has been in the design for months.''
   ``The unions knew very well this was in the design for months,
and they came in at the very last minute.'' Lorenzo said at the
opening of the terminal that will serve as the East Coast hub of
Continental Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary.

   Robert Page, president and publisher of the
Chicago Sun-Times, has resigned, two years after spearheading a
buyout of the newspaper from Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch,
the paper announced Thursday.
   Page's resignation was announced by Sun-Times Chairman Leonard
P. Shaykin in a two-page press release that also said the company
had repurchased Page's shares in the corporation.
   Shaykin is managing partner of Adler & Shaykin, a New York
investment firm that was one of the principle investors in the
group Page lined up to buy the Sun-Times for $145 million in June
1986.
   ``Bob Page has contributed much to the Sun-Times,'' Shaykin said
in the statement. ``He has now decided to pursue other interests.
All of us at the Sun-Times wish him well in whatever he chooses to
do.''
   The paper also released a two-page statement by Page.
   ``I leave the Sun-Times with regret but with a strong management
team and staff that as a newspaper is well positioned to continue
its vital role as a unique and important Chicago institution,''
Page said in the statement.
   Page had been president and publisher of the Sun-Times since
1984, when Murdoch's News America Publishing Corp. bought the paper
from its long-time owners, the Field family of Chicago.
   The press release made no mention of a possible successor and
the Sun-Times planned no further comment, said spokeswoman Marie
Mariorca.
   The Sun-Times is second in circulation in the metropolitan
Chicago area to the Chicago Tribune, with 625,000 daily.
   Rumor of Page's departure was reported Sunday in the Chicago
Tribune. The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Page had been
at odds with Shaykin over the financial performance of the
Sun-Times. But spokesmen for Sun-Times refused to comment on that
report Thursday.
   When the paper was purchased from Murdoch, Page promised a
``more serious, more purposeful'' look. At the time, it was the
nation's 11th largest daily.
   During Page's tenure, the newspaper hired several top
journalists from the competing Chicago Tribune, including current
managing editor Raymond Coffey. One of the biggest defectors was
columnist Ann Landers, who jumped to the Tribune.
   Page was in the newsroom Thursday when word of his resignation
broke, but slipped out of the building without talking to reporters
waiting outside.
   Sun-Times columnist Irv Kupcinet called Page a ``good friend.''
   ``I think he lifted us up out of the morass of the Rupert
Murdoch era,'' Kupcinet said. ``I think we have a very solid
future.''
   But one reporter, who asked that his name not be used, said:
``Let's just say (Page) won't find too many broken hearts here.''
   Page came to Chicago after overseeing the revitalization of
Murdoch's Boston Herald.

<HEAD>Economic White Paper Confirms Trend Away From Exports, Toward
Spending</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Japanese are abandoning their successful
sell-overseas, save-at-home formula and pumping more yen into their
own markets, boosting imports and their taste for upscale consumer
goods, according to a government study released Friday.
   The Economic Planning Agency, broadly summarizing trends in the
1987 fiscal year that ended in March, said booming consumption
among the once-frugal Japanese had pulled the economy through a
brief crisis triggered when the soaring yen battered Japanese
exports.
   The agency's white paper also said the long-term picture
indicates the trend should continue.
   ``When we look at the Japanese economy now, it is very close to
an ideal state of affairs,'' said Shunji Fukinbara, head of the
agency's Research Bureau. ``Japanese corporations have shifted the
emphasis from export-led development to domestic sales.
   ``In line with their catch-up efforts with the Asian newly
industrialized economies, Japanese corporations shed some business
activities that don't pay and encouraged new businesses and
products,'' he said.
   The corporate self-scrutiny, together with cheaper prices of oil
and imports and lower lending rates, helped stabilize the economy
and ease a jobless rate that peaked at a postwar high of 3.2
percent early in 1987, the report said.
   Japan's currency nearly has doubled in value against the U.S.
dollar since late 1985, when world monetary leaders agreed to
devalue the dollar to help the competitiveness of American exports
and trim Washington's massive trade deficit.
   Japanese economic growth, which registered a sluggish 2.5
percent in fiscal 1986, was 4.9 percent last year.
   Growth in imports outpaced exports, with goods from the European
Community and Asia's economic dynamos _ South Korea, Taiwan, Hong
Kong and ingapore _ outpacing shipments from the United States.
   While import volume was up 12 percent in 1987, exports rose by
only 1.1 percent, Fukinbara said. Manufactured imports scored a
substantial 45.6 percent gain, partly because Japanese exporters
were moving factories to cheaper sites overseas and shipping the
goods home.
   Japanese tastes were tending toward the affluent. Fukinbara
noted a rise in purchases of luxury goods from Europe and durable
consumer goods: videotape recorders, automobiles and television
sets, often with value-added features such as extra-wide screens.
   But soaring values of stocks and land, particularly in Tokyo,
are widening an assets gap among the predominantly middle-class
Japanese. The white paper noted that the average office worker no
longer can hope to buy a house and land in the capital even with
his lifetime savings.
   ``There may be a growing disparity between the haves and
have-nots in Japan,'' Fukinbara said.
   The report suggested that Japan do more to open its markets to
foreign goods, give public and private aid to developing countries
and use its growing influence to stabilize the global monetary
system and promote free trade.
