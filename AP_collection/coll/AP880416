   Hordes of crop-devouring locusts
sweeping across northwestern Africa have reached Mali, and the
government has issued an urgent plea for foreign help.
   Mali Agriculture Minister Moulaye Mohamed has asked for
$140,000, 52,000 gallons of insecticide and 500 hours of airplane
time to launch a spraying campaign, according to Mali radio.
   ``It is while going through hard times that one knows one's true
friends,'' Moulaye told the diplomatic corps in the capital of
Bamako on Thursday, according to the broadcast.
   It said he called the locusts a ``major threat,'' moving south
from Algeria and Mauritania and advancing as far as 160 acres a day.
   He said the first swarms in Mali were reported Monday near the
western city of Kayes.
   The intensity of the swarm was estimated at more than 200
insects per square yard, the minister said, and they were
destroying up to 40 percent of vegetation.
   Locust invasions have been a seasonal occurence in many parts of
Africa for hundreds of years, but the Rome-based U.N. Food and
Agricultural Organization has called the present crisis the worst
in 30 years.

   Nuclear workers lost track this month
of five shipments of radioactive garbage from West Germany but
later found them, an official said Friday.
   ``The investigation has taught us a lesson,'' said Paul Ek, an
engineer with the Atomic Energy Board. ``We have to tighten our
control of the transports.''
   He said the five containers of nuclear waste arrived for
disposal as planned at Sweden's Studsvik plant but they were not
properly registered and were reported missing April 1.
   The Atomic Energy Board traced the material through the West
German Environmental Ministry and the Transnuklear company that
organized the transports, according to Ek.
   He said a stronger control system, including customs reports on
all nuclear waste shipments, will be implemented during the next
budget year.
   ``We will also demand that the nuclear plants and Studsvik
inform us of transports within the country beforehand to make it
possible to estimate what security is needed,'' he added.
   The new reporting system will enable the board to monitor the
waste transports step-by-step in the same way as shipments of
atomic fuel, Ek said.

<HEAD>Titanic Memorabilia Auctioned On 76th Anniversary Of Sinking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A postcard mailed from the Titanic fetched $2,068
during an auction Friday, the 76th anniversary of the ocean liner's
sinking, but a water-stained letter found on the body of a dead
passenger went unsold.
   The auction of 200 items of Titanic memorabilia raised $56,400,
Onslow's Auctioneers reported.
   A spokesman said the water-stained letter didn't sell because it
may have been considered too ghoulish.
   One collector paid $2,068 for the postcard stamped on the ship
and posted when it stopped in Ireland.
   Northern Ireland's Ulster Folk and Transport Museum paid the
auction's top price of $14,100 for a 1912 watercolor painting
entitled ``Fitting Out The Titanic, Belfast.''
   The Titanic, built in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and declared
unsinkable, went down in the Atlantic on April 15, 1912, after
hitting an iceberg while on its maiden voyage from Southampton,
England, to New York. A total of 1,513 people perished.
   The wreck of the liner about 2.5 miles below the surface and 350
miles south of Newfoundland was first located by a U.S.-French
expedition in September 1985.

<HEAD>Dairy's Beef Forces Zarda Movie To Change Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Duck's Breath Mystery
Theater say they were trying to conjure up memories of old Japanese
horror movies when they struck on the title ``Zarda, Cow From
Hell.''
   But the name for the movie involving a giant, demonic bovine
didn't get any laughs from Ben Zarda, owner of the Zarda Dairy in
Shawnee, Kan.
   ``The Zarda people decided they'd rather we not use that name.
It's unfortunate because we'd grown attached to it,'' said
executive producer Scott Smith, who went along with Zarda's wishes.
   The company learned of Zarda, the dairy, from director Robert C.
Hughes, a native of Kansas City, Kan.
   ``The cow connection just blew us away,'' Smith said.
   ``We took the name out of the blue,'' he said. ``We wanted it to
sound like a Japanese horror movie. It was supposed to be a
nonsensical name.''
   Duck's Breath Mystery Theater, a band of offbeat comics who got
their start at the University of Iowa and came back to Iowa City to
make the movie, has been working on the Zarda concept for some time.
   ``Its something we've been kicking around for about 10 years,''
said Duck's Breath manager Steve Baker of San Francisco.
   ``The story line has a film company from Hollywood coming to
Iowa to make a sleazy horror film about a giant cow,'' Baker said.
``The film company has such exaggerated characters, so absurd, that
it turns out the good folks of Iowa are more qualified to make the
movie than Hollywood types.''
   More than 600 people showed up in Iowa City this week to
audition for about 40 parts in the film. Smith said the movie
should be in the can by August.
   Meanwhile, the group is considering another name for the
production.
   ``Something equally Japanese horror movie-like, something like
Zorka,'' Smith said.

<HEAD>Transplantation Of Fetal Tissue Becomes Focus Of Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Administration denial of permission for
government scientists to transplant brain tissue from aborted
fetuses to patients with Parkinson's disease has put a spotlight on
what one expert calls ``terrifying ethical questions.''
   Ethicist Arthur Caplan of the University of Minnesota said he is
concerned because the decision, disclosed Friday, flowed more from
political opposition to abortion than an effort to stimulate public
debate.
   An administration official acknowledged that the issue has been
a hot topic within the government health bureaucracy but denied
that the decision to set up an advisory panel to consider the
issues was driven by politics.
   The official, who discussed the matter on condition of
anonymity, said the ban does not apply to all research on fetuses,
but rather is limited to the emerging technology of implanting
fresh fetal tissue into humans.
   ``There are terrifying ethical questions surrounding the use of
fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes in human beings,'' Caplan,
head of his university's Center for Biomedical Ethics, said Friday
in a telephone interview.
   He said those include ``the source and whether you would
legitimate abortion or induce someone to have an abortion who
wouldn't otherwise, questions of payment, questions of control over
the tissue ... whether it can be sold to commercial companies or
whoever, questions of safety.''
   Caplan _ who noted that the ban on National Institutes of Health
research in the field does not keep private researchers from
performing such experiments _ said he knows of three instances in
which women considered becoming pregnant to produce fetal tissue
that could be used to help treat their own diseases or those of a
relative.
   ``I think those are totally immoral because of a basic principle
that you don't create life solely for the purpose of destroying
it,'' he said.
   The only documented use of the specific experimental procedure
NIH scientists were barred from undertaking occurred in January
when surgeons in Mexico City said they had injected tissue from a
miscarried fetus into the brains of two Parkinson's sufferers.
   Parkinson's disease causes gradual loss of muscle control and is
potentially fatal. The fetal tissue is believed to work by
stimulating production of dopamine, a brain chemical lacking in
people who suffer from Parkinson's.
   The decision to keep NIH scientists from going forward with a
transplant experiment came last week in a letter from Dr. Robert E.
Windom, assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health
and Human Services, to NIH Director James B. Wyngaarden.
   ``This proposal raises a number of questions _ primarily ethical
and legal _ that have not been satisfactorily addressed, either
within the Public Health Service or within society,'' Windom wrote.
   The letter instructs Wyngaarden to appoint an outside advisory
committee to examine the ethical, medical and legal implications of
using tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses.
   The prohibition does not ban continuing research on tissue from
fetuses from miscarriages or stillbirths, but that type generally
is not feasible to use in the kind of transplant research the NIH
proposal contemplated.
   A few conferences have been held by ethicists and researchers on
the new technology, but no clear consensus has emerged.
   A letter published in Science magazine last year by participants
in a seminar at Case Western Reserve University is one of the
clearest statements on the potential questions.
   The letter recommended that there should be ``a clear separation
between decisions related to the acquisition of tissue and
decisions regarding the transplanting of tissue into a recipient.''
   Judith Areen, a Georgetown University law professor who was on
the panel, explained Friday in an interview, ``In other words, you
don't want the fact of transplantation to be the reason a woman has
an abortion.''
   A second recommendation was that the donor not know the
recipient.

   For Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, the
Mr. Smooth of the Reagan administration, it was a rare public
relations disaster.
   He had a careful script which called for finance leaders of the
seven major industrial countries to demonstrate close-knit harmony
as a way of reassuring financial markets of their resolve to
continue stabilizing the dollar.
   The group's communique, which included many of Baker's pet
proposals, was approved and issued on schedule Wednesday. But after
that, the script went badly awry.
   Instead of rallying on the news, financial markets chose to
focus the next day on a disappointing report that the U.S. trade
deficit unexpectedly rose in February to $13.8 billion.
   The bad news sent the dollar into a nosedive, and the major
industrial countries had to launch hurriedly a multimillion-dollar
rescue effort to try to brake the fall.
   By Friday, after spending by some estimates more than $700
million to buy dollars on currency exchanges, the seven industrial
powers were able to stabilize the dollar, but at a level 2 percent
below where it was before the countries began their meetings
Wednesday.
   And the turmoil raised anew troubling questions about the
fragility of world financial markets which Baker had hoped to put
to rest with a show of unity this week.
   The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven _ the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy _ was being
held in conjunction with the semi-annual meeting of the 151-nation
International Monetary Fund and its sister organization, the World
Bank.
   World Bank President Barber Conable said Friday it was critical
that the two lending organizations face up to the need to reduce
poor countries' debt burden, which is estimated to total $1.245
trillion at the end of this year.
   Nigel Lawson, British chancellor of the exchequer, offered as
one solution a plan to reduce the interest rates the debtor
countries pay on their loans.
   ``All of us know that there is no way in which the poorest
countries can meet their interest payments,'' he said. ``The
interest burden thus mounts exponentially and the poorest countries
are thus caught in a vicious circle.''
   B.T.G. Chidzero, Zimbabwe's finance minister, warned at a news
conference that there could be political and social upheavals in
Third World countries unless the debt problem is solved.
   ``They would not leave the industrial countries untouched,''
Chidzero said.
   But in between discussions about debt, the finance ministers
found themselves having to deal in hastily called meetings with the
plunging dollar.
   Administration sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan huddled
at IMF headquarters Thursday with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg to
discuss the dollar selloff.
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson told reporters Friday
that he believed the markets had calmed in part because investors
realized that the underlying fundamentals of the economy are sound
with growth continuing at good rates despite last October's stock
market collapse.
   ``I think the reaction Thursday was one of surprise, but we all
realize that the trade figures are erratic and as people reflected
on that, things calmed down,'' he said.
   Dutch Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding, who heads the IMF's
policymaking committee, said the market turmoil did not cause the
countries to make any major changes to their final communique,
which predicted continued growth at a ``steady, moderate'' pace
this year.
   ``We are trying to improve the (world economic) system
regardless of the vagaries of the market from day to day,'' Ruding
said.

   Representatives of organized labor, the state
of Michigan and parts manufacturers continued their criticism of
the U.S. free-trade agreement with Canada, telling a Senate panel
it benefits big automakers but no one else.
   ``The Big Three is very happy with the agreement, and they
should be,'' said Marc Santucci, trade representative for Michigan,
where the large automakers have their headquarters. ``It is a very
good agreement for the companies. It is not such a good agreement
for the country.
   ``As we become a global economy, we have companies no longer
speaking for the best interests of the country,'' Santucci told the
Senate Finance Committee.
   But Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicles Manufacturers
Association, which represents the major automakers, called the
treaty ``one that we believe advances U.S. national interests''
while helping the industry.
   The agreement, which requires passage by both houses of Congress
without amendment, would eliminate trade barriers between the two
nations on a wide range of goods and services. The automotive
sector accounts for about one-third of trade between the United
States and Canada.
   One provision of the agreement strongly criticized by the United
Auto Workers, parts makers and the Michigan representative allows
Canada to retain until 1996 agreements giving preferential duty
treatment to manufacturers from outside North America having
Canadian production.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, a Michigan Democrat and member of the
Finance Committee, said that provision would have effects lasting
far beyond 1996.
   ``It is widely acknowledged that, particularly in the case of
Japanese manufacturers, once a part supplier is chosen, it is a
relationship of long standing,'' Riegle said. ``By providing
Canadian suppliers with this advantage for the next seven years,
U.S. parts producers are cut out of future opportunities to supply
these plants.''
   Hanna said the manufacturers supported immediate elimination of
duty remissions, but he called the delay ``a compromise worth
accepting and supporting.''
   A second provision the UAW and parts suppliers would like to see
removed requires vehicles shipped duty-free between the two nations
to have 50 percent North American content.
   The UAW believes the content figure in the agreement ``is not
high enough to assure the use of locally produced engines,
transmission and other major components,'' said Steve Beckman, the
international economist for the UAW.
   ``It would allow the Big Three to shrink the North American
content of their vehicles down to the new standard, which is far
below the present level,'' he said.
   The manufacturers believe a 50 percent rule of origin is
sufficiently high to ``do the job it was designed to do, and that
is to ensure that the benefits of the agreement accrue to those
companies and products which can reasonably and fairly be
considered as Canadian or American in origin,'' Hanna said.

<HEAD>US Rice Growers Expected To Benefit From Lower Production In Rice
Bowl</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's rice bowl is skimpier this year,
and the Agriculture Department says that could help American rice
growers export more in the early months of the 1988-89 season.
   World rice production from the 1987-88 harvests is forecast at
304 million metric tons, milled equivalent, down 4 percent from
last year, the department's Economic Research Service said Friday.
Weak monsoons left Asian producers with limited exportable supplies.
   Meanwhile, global rice consumption is expected to increase 3
percent, leaving world stockpiles at their lowest level relative to
use since 1974.
   ``Recently, world production shortfalls and declining stocks in
major importing countries have led to large world imports,'' the
report said. ``However, world trade in 1988 is expected to decline
18 percent because high prices and reduced supplies in major
exporting countries have deterred imports.''
   The U.S. rice supply also has tightened, reflecting a 6 percent
reduction in last year's harvest.
   But the department's planting survey in early March indicated
American producers intend to boost 1988 rice plantings by 19
percent to 2.8 million acres. That could boost this year's output
to around 155 million hundredweight from 128 million in 1987.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds, and there are slightly more
than 22 hundredweight in a ton.
   ``U.S. farmers will harvest rice crops at least four months
ahead of their Asian competitors,'' the report said. ``Since the
United States will be the major source of supply during those
months, some increased export opportunities may exist towards the
end of 1988.''
   However, analysts cautioned that some foreign importers, if
possible, may ``choose to wait until the beginning of 1989, when
prices are likely to decline during the Asian harvest.''
   The report said some foreign importers also have been
substituting wheat for higher-priced rice.
   ``In addition, shipments of U.S. rice under food aid are
expected to decrease this year because of high prices,'' the report
said.

   The Agriculture Department's conservation
chief says more volunteers are needed to help carry out a massive
program aimed at protecting the nation's soil and water resources.
   Wilson Scaling, head of the Soil Conservation Service, says that
in 1987 some 2,200 volunteers provided more than $1 million worth
of assistance to agency field offices.
   This ``Earth Team,'' he said Friday, put in more than 132,000
hours in helping with tree planting, making inventories of
wetlands, conservation education, telephoning landowners to inform
them of the Conservervation Reserve Program, and providing clerical
and other office work.
   Many of the volunteers have expertise in geology, biology,
botany, surveying, mapping, and soil and erodibility
determinations, Scaling said.
   Under 1985 farm law, farmers with highly erodible cropland must
have a conservation plan approved by Dec. 31, 1989, and have it
implemented by Dec. 31, 1994, or lose USDA benefits such as price
support loans, payments and insurance.
   Scaling said the agency estimates that 800,000 conservation
plans still need to be developed nationwide.
   Anyone interested in volunteering for the Earth Team, he said,
can call 1-800-THE SOIL for the location of the local office.
Volunteers receive coverage for injury claims, are compensated for
travel expenses, and have their contributions made part of a
permanent work record, Scaling said.

<HEAD>Congress Looking to Home-Grown Alternatives to Persian Gulf Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is moving the nation on a path some
lawmakers say will switch the U.S. energy appetite from the
political quagmire of the Persian Gulf to the more inviting
mountains of West Virginia and cornfields of Iowa.
   The path is alternative motor fuels, substances like methanol
and ethanol that advocates say can curb growing U.S. dependence on
imported petroleum and cut the trade deficit.
   Conversion of the U.S. car and light truck fleet to methanol
``means that the energy crisis would be over for generations,''
says a principal backer of the switch, Sen. Jack Danforth, R-Mo.
   On Friday, the Senate gave voice-vote approval to legislation by
Danforth and Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., designed to encourage
automakers to begin mass-producing alternative fuel vehicles by
1993.
   Although there are concerns about the effects of some fuels on
the environment, it is all but certain that Congress will enact
alternative fuels legislation in 1988.
   A similar bill was passed overwhelmingly by the House earlier
this year. The bills' differences will have to be resolved by
negotiators from both chambers.
   The proposals envision an America where cars are powered by fuel
produced by abundant domestic resources. Ethanol is made from
grains like corn. Methanol, which powers Indianapolis 500 race
cars, is produced from coal or natural gas.
   But Senate Environment Committee members are warning that
alternative fuels are not a nirvana. They say coal-based methanol
will increase emissions of carbon dioxide, the ``greenhouse'' gas
that some scientists say contributes to a dangerous overheating of
the Earth's atmosphere.
   Danforth says the legislation would break an impasse that now
prevents any widespread switchover from gasoline to alternative
fuels.
   ``Automakers are unwilling to produce (alternative fuel) cars
for which there is no current demand,'' he said. ``Consumers are
unwilling to purchase cars for which there is no readily available
fuel supply, and service stations are unwilling to provide fuel for
cars that are not on the road.''
   Rockefeller said that besides lessening the growing U.S. need
for imported oil, a conversion of just 10 percent of the U.S.
vehicle fleet to coal-based methanol would mean jobs for 20,000
miners in the depressed coal industry.
   The senators say the legislation would make it easier for
automakers to meet the federal requirement that their fleets have
an average fuel economy of at least 26 miles per gallon,
encouraging the use of the alternative fuels.
   Sens. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., and John Chafee, R-R.I., members
of the Environment Committee, are urging caution, however, because
of possible environmental and health problems.
   Stafford said coal-derived methanol would double emissions of
carbon dioxide and bring a tenfold increase in tailpipe emissions
of formaldehyde, a cancer-causing chemical.
   He said a growing number of scientists are warning that man's
production of greenhouse gases is overloading the atmosphere,
trapping heat around the Earth and threatening major climate
changes.
   ``Once we commit to a program like this, it will be too late,''
said Stafford.

   A group of union presidents and business
leaders is seeking a thaw in labor-management relations, in part by
encouraging experiments on employee participation in business
decisions.
   United Steelworkers of America President Lynn Williams hailed
the position paper endorsed Friday by 19 labor leaders and
corporate officers as ``a landmark in labor-management relations.''
   The leaders are members of the Collective Bargaining Forum, a
group formed in 1985 by B.F. Goodrich Co. Chairman John D. Ong and
Glenn Watts, president emeritus of the Communication Workers of
America, to increase dialogue between unions and businesses.
   Williams, at a press conference Friday, conceded the strategies
in the paper on ``New Directions for Labor and Management,'' were
provoked in part by ``troubled times.''
   The nation's unions suffered a net loss of 62,000 members last
year despite an increase of 2.5 million in the number of Americans
holding full-time jobs.
   The document, published by the Department of Labor, said it is
widely recognized that American industry must enhance its
competitiveness in world markets.
   Besides Williams, union officials on the forum included United
Automobile Workers President Owen Bieber, Communication Workers of
America President Morton Bahr and Howard Samuel, president of the
Industrial Union Department of the AFL-CIO.
   Corporate officers included CSX Transportation Co. President
John Snow, Ameritech Corp. Chairman William L. Weiss and Ford Motor
Chairman Donald Petersen.
   The document encouraged labor and management to experiment with
sharing information and participation of workers in ``strategic and
management business decisions.'' Such arrangements, it said, could
defuse tensions caused by unions whose positions force them to
concentrate more on preserving current benefits than on increasing
firms' abilities to compete.
   The report also said management should treat employees' job
security ``at the policy level,'' considering it alongside other
business strategies, Ameritech's Weiss said.
   But Weiss said the newly-defined management responsibilities are
``by no means a one-way street. Unions, too, have to take a broader
view of their responsibilities _ and of where their best interests
lie.''
   The report said workers could enhance their own job security by
taking advantage of educational opportunities and accepting new
jobs with an employer if their old positions become obsolete.
   The document was short on specifics, not mentioning, for
example, a sweeping trade bill on Capitol Hill. Williams and other
labor leaders have been pushing for the bill to include a provision
requiring companies with at least 100 employees to give 60-day
notice of plant closings or layoffs under many situations.

   Former President Richard Nixon told the
nation's newspaper editors Vice President George Bush will beat
Democrat Michael Dukakis in a squeaker in November's presidential
election.
   One of only two men to have run five times for national office,
Nixon told the annual convention of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors on Friday that Bush will carry the South and put
together enough electoral votes through the farm belt and mountain
states to carry him to the White House.
   Nixon ran successfully twice for president and twice for vice
president and lost the presidential race in 1960. The other
five-time national candidate was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won the
presidency four times but lost as a vice presidential candiate in
1920.
   Before the same group of editors in 1984, Nixon correctly
predicted that Walter Mondale would be the Democratic nominee but
incorrectly foresaw that Mondale would choose then-Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart or Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, as his running mate.
Mondale ran with Geraldine Ferraro, then a New York congresswoman.
   On Friday, he gave a state-by-state rundown of this year's race
to a packed room at the convention.
   ``First, on the East Coast, Dukakis will win Massachusetts, New
York, Pennsylvania,'' said Nixon, speaking rapidly, without notes.
``Bush will win Florida, South Carolina, Virginia. Dukakis will win
Maryland.
   ``North Carolina, I would call virtually a tossup, a slight edge
to Bush.''
   Nixon said the Midwest is tough to call. ``Dukakis will win
Michigan. Bush will win Indiana. Ohio and Illinois ... they could
go either way.''
   But he said Bush should beat Dukakis in the South.
   ``The farm states, unless you have (Kansas Sen. Bob) Dole on the
ticket, or someone else with appeal in the agricultural areas,
we're going to find a situation where Dukakis is going to win in
Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Iowa. Bush will hold
Kansas and Nebraska and Oklahoma. Missouri is a tossup, always is.
   ``The mountain states,'' Nixon continued, ``Bush will win all of
them except Montana and possibly New Mexico.
   ``The West Coast _ Washington, Dukakis; Oregon, about even.
California, the big enchilada, you pay your money and take your
choice.''
   And finally, said Nixon, ``in the end I believe Bush will win in
a very close election.''

<HEAD>MS Group Trustees Were Informed of Plan for Mrs. Meese but Didn't
Vote</HEAD>

   Trustees for the Multiple Sclerosis Society
were told in advance of plans to hire Attorney General Edwin
Meese's wife, Ursula, with money from the foundation of a wealthy
Washington real-estate family, the society attorney says.
   Attorney James Bierbower said Friday he had found minutes in
society records that showed the board of trustees was advised of
the plan at a Dec. 12, 1985, meeting. Mrs. Meese started work in
January 1986.
   Bierbower said the trustees didn't vote on the plan for Mrs.
Meese, who was hired at $40,000 a year with funds from The Bender
Foundation.
   Independent counsel James McKay is investigating Mrs. Meese's
hiring as part of his inquiry into whether the attorney general
violated federal law through any conflict of interest between his
family's financial affairs and his government duties.
   A partnership headed by Howard M. Bender, the foundation's vice
president, later won a $50 million lease to provide offices for the
Justice Department in a building the government once planned to
move out of.
   Some MS trustees had complained that they only read of Mrs.
Meese's hiring in newspaper accounts in the last two weeks. Not all
board members attend each quarterly meeting.
   Bierbower said the minutes revealed trustees were told a grant
from the Bender Foundation would enable the chapter to ``hire a
development consultant to work full-time in seeking non-government
funding for the job placement program.''
   The minutes continued: ``Ursula Meese will be joining the staff
in this capacity and also will continue to serve on the board of
trustees.''
   Bierbower said he thought the board was informed of the grant by
Jeanne Bradley, the society's executive director.
   He said the minutes do not reflect that any vote was taken. ``I
would imagine it was just a no-objection'' notification, he said.
   Mrs. Meese, 56, had been a volunteer at the agency since 1981
and was herself a trustee. She was hired to expand Operation Job
Match, which finds work for MS victims.

<HEAD>Old Mobster Says Younger Mafiosi Are Less Disciplined</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former underboss of the Cleveland mob says
narcotics trafficking has broken down the once iron-clad obedience
that U.S. organized crime members had for their leaders.
   Angelo Lonardo, the former underboss of the Cleveland family of
La Cosa Nostra, testified Friday that younger members of the mob
``don't take orders like they used to.''
   ``These younger members go ahead and do things on their own,''
he told the Senate Permanent Investigations subcommittee.
   Lonardo blamed the breakdown on the willingness of younger
mobsters to ignore their leaders' rules against narcotics
trafficking.
   ``Greed is causing younger members to go into narcotics without
the knowledge of the families,'' said the 77-year-old Lonardo, who
is currently in the federal witness protection program and was
shielded from the public by a screen.
   Last Monday, a former member of the Sicilian Mafia told the same
panel that drugs were causing the same problem in Italy.
   Tommaso Buscetta told the subcommittee: ``I have seen money,
drugs and greed corrupt and destroy the Cosa Nostra code of honor
and loyalty to the families.
   ``I began to realize that drugs had changed everything, the
family loyalties and codes of respect that I had known as a Mafioso
were quickly becoming things of the past.''
   Lonardo, who testified under a grant of immunity, said the mob
leaders don't like the narcotics trade because it usually brings
greater scrutiny from law enforcement organizations.
   Lonardo also testified that organized crime played a large role
in Teamsters union affairs, including the elections of former
president Roy L. Williams and current president Jackie Presser.
   He said he was part of a 1981 effort to line up organized crime
support for Williams' successful candidacy.
   And when it became clear that an indictment against Williams
would force him to step down, Lonardo said he traveled to Chicago
to obtain organized crime's backing of Cleveland native Presser.
   Presser, who currently is under indictment, was the ``protege''
of a man affiliated with the Cleveland mob, and it was felt his
election ``would increase the Cleveland family's prestige and
respect,'' Lonardo said.
   At Teamsters headquarters in Washington, there was no one
available to comment on Lonardo's testimony Friday.
   Lonardo said many of the Teamsters union officials were ``made''
_ inducted into _ organized crime families before getting their
union positions.
   ``They listen to the families that made them,'' he said. ``It's
mostly the delegates and the vice presidents. They get their jobs
through the families.''
   ``The delegates who elect the top Teamsters are members of La
Cosa Nostra?'' Nunn asked. Lonardo said that was the case.
   Presser, who heads the Cleveland local of the Teamsters in
addition to the international union, is under indictment on charges
of union racketeering and conspiracy to embezzle by having ghost
employees on the union payroll.
   Presser said the FBI authorized his actions, and faces trial in
July in Cleveland.
   Williams was convicted of offering a bribe to former Sen. Howard
Cannon, D-Nev., in trying to block trucking deregulation
legislation.

<HEAD>Reagan, Advisers Weighing Response To Gulf Mining Incident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan and his top advisers
discussed a U.S. response to the mine explosion in the Persian Gulf
that almost sank an American frigate, according to an
administration source who refused to say whether military
retaliation was considered.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, also would not
say if any decisions were made.
   Maj. David Super, a Pentagon spokesman, said late Friday he had
no information on any plans for military action in the gulf area in
response to the incident, which injured 10 sailors aboard the USS
Samuel B. Roberts.
   The Pentagon said it believed the mines were made by Iran, but
U.S. officials say they do not know who placed the mines in the
gulf.
   The White House discussion occurred at a regular meeting Friday
of the National Security Council and was among many topics
discussed at the session, which was dominated by planning for
Reagan's May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, the source said.
   Bob Hall, a White House spokesman, declined comment, saying,
``We never discuss these kinds of meetings at the White House.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked during a briefing
earlier Friday whether the administration planned to retaliate for
the mining, said, ``We never discuss future military actions.''
   Asked if the administration had determined who was responsible
for the mining, he said, ``No. We have not.''
   The Pentagon, meanwhile, said two mines found later in the area
near where the explosion occurred were identical to the ones
recovered last autumn from an Iranian ship, but were new mines that
had been put in the gulf recently.
   ``These were shiny, bright mines,'' Super said. ``The mines are
identical to the ones recovered aboard the Iranian ship, the Ajr,
that we intercepted several months ago that had the mines aboard
it.''
   The earlier mines were made by Iran, he said, adding, ``We
believe that these were of Iranian manufacture as well.''
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that the group
that met at the White House discussed a wide range of possible
military responses to the Roberts incident. But the newspaper,
citing sources it did not identify, said Reagan settled for
assessing military options rather than acting on any of them.
   The newspaper said officials said one reason a military strike
had not been ordered was the lack of hard evidence that Iran laid
the mines.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war in the area for 7{ years. The
Roberts was in the gulf as part of the U.S. operation escorting
American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway to protect
them from Iranian attacks.
   The options discussed at the meeting, according to the Post,
ranged from a simple show of force by sending the battleship USS
New Jersey to the region, to launching a retaliatory strike against
a long list of possible targets.
   According to the Pentagon, the two mines spotted from the air by
a reconnaissance helicopter were photographed and later destroyed
by a Navy team.
   Spokesman Lt. Col. Keith Schneider said the mines were moored by
cables to the bottom of the Gulf and the Navy will search for more
mines at daylight Saturday.
   The Roberts on Friday was being towed to Dubai for repairs. All
10 sailors injured in the explosion remained hospitalized, and two
of them were in critical condition.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Jackson Are ``Singularly Important'' In New York; Gore
Borrows More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis got praise but no endorsement from Gov. Mario
Cuomo, but saw his support solidifying in the polls heading into
the final weekend before New York's pivotal primary.
   The front-runner argued long distance with Vice President George
Bush Friday over the Reagan administration's anti-drug efforts as
Jesse Jackson mocked the claims of other candidates and said ``I'm
the general'' in the drug war.
   While Dukakis and Jackson were aiming their rhetoric at
Republicans, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. took out more loans as
polls showed his New York support languishing in the single digits
_ a finish that could cripple his campaign.
   Dukakis made the same pilgrimage to the state Capitol in Albany
on Friday that Jackson made earlier in the week, and heard
virtually the same words of praise.
   Cuomo said at a news conference that Dukakis is ``a singularly
important Democratic leader.''
   Two days earlier, the governor had told Jackson he was
``singularly important Democrat.''
   Questioned by reporters, Cuomo said all the Democratic
candidates, including Gore, were ``singularly important,'' no
matter where they finish.
   Despite Cuomo's arms-length praise, the Dukakis campaign is
getting more encouragement from polls being released in the final
days before New York Democrats vote Tuesday on their 255 delegates.
   Several showed the Massachusetts governor with a comfortable
lead over Jackson, with Gore a distant third.
   An ABC News-Washington Post tracking poll released Friday
evening had Dukakis with 44 percent, Jackson 37 percent and Gore 10
percent. The poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday among 268
likely Democratic voters in New York, with a margin of error of 7
percentage points.
   And the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion indicated
Dukakis may have overcome the weakness of support that marked his
early contests. It said 67 percent of his support was strong, 9
points better than Walter Mondale's in 1984 when Mondale won the
state.
   While the candidates focused on high-stakes New York, Arizona
Democrats trooped to caucuses today to register their preference.
That low-profile contest, with 36 delegates up for grabs, was seen
as a Jackson-Dukakis duel.
   In addition, South Carolina and North Dakota Democrats gathered
at state conventions and put their final stamp on delegations to
the Democratic National Convention in July. At earlier caucuses,
Jackson resoundingly won South Carolina; Dukakis was the winner in
North Dakota.
   Dukakis and Jackson turned to the drug issue Friday, blasting
Reagan administration efforts against drug trafficking
   In Albany, Dukakis criticized the administration for putting
``drug-peddling'' Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega on
the U.S. payroll.
   ``Why do we have money for Star Wars and not money for a war
against drugs?'' he asked. ``The greatest threat in this hemisphere
is not the Sandinistas, it's the avalanche of drugs.''
   Jackson hit the same theme at a Queens housing project,
ridiculing administration anti-drug efforts, as well as his
Democratic rivals.
   He described Dukakis and Gore as captains and lieutenants in the
battle against drugs and said, ``I'm the general in this war.''
   Late Friday, Jackson addressed several thousand people at a gay
and lesbian rally in Greenwich Village.
   ``I stood with you because it was the right thing to do,'' he
told them.
   His statement that ``testing for AIDS must be voluntary and
confidential'' drew loud cheers from the crowd that extended a full
block.
   Dukakis toured a Greenwich Village residence for people
suffering from AIDS, and encountered a handful of protesters nearby
chanting ``Gays vote too.'' Dukakis has stirred opposition from
some militant gays because of his state's policy of giving a low
priority to gays in seeking to become foster parents.
   He ended a long campaign day with a private meeting with Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias at New York's Plaza Hotel, saying he
had discussed with Arias the progress of the Central American peace
plan.
   Bush held a ``unity'' meeting with former rival Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole and stepped up his criticism of the Democrats, saying their
comments on drugs were ``demagogic statements.''
   ``It is this administration that has brought Noriega to justice,
or at least taken the first step,'' Bush told the annual convention
of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Meanwhile, Gore has begun to feel financial pressure.
   Gore's campaign is $1.6 million in debt after taking out
$100,000 in new loans from banks in his home state. He has spent at
least $700,000 on New York television advertising, about half of
what Dukakis has spent.

   A jury Friday rejected an insanity defense and
convicted an ex-policeman of murdering nine people he said were
drug dealers who deserved to die.
   The jury reached the verdict against Manny Pardo after 6{ hours
of deliberation. It will return Wednesday to decide whether the
31-year-old worshipper of Adolf Hitler should receive the death
penalty.
   The shooting deaths occurred in Miami over a period of several
months in 1986. Pardo's victims were shot several times, generally
at close range, some in their homes and some in vehicles. Three
victims were women, six were men.
   Defense attorney Ronald Guralnick had argued that Pardo was
insane, but Pardo himself denied it, testifying that the victims
were ``not human beings'' but parasites and leeches, and that
somebody had to kill them.
   ``There's good and bad in everybody,'' Guralnick said after the
verdict. ``He saved kids' lives.''
   The prosecution contended that Pardo was a drug dealer who
killed rival dealers but that not all his victims were involved in
drugs. One was a weapons expert, and two others had a dispute with
him about money, the prosecution said.
   In an interview with WPLG-TV after his conviction, Pardo said he
wished he had killed more people. ``The system doesn't work,'' he
said. ``I was making it work my way. I was judge, jury and
executioner.''
   Pardo worked as a Florida Highway Patrol trooper and Sweetwater
patrolman from 1978 to 1985, when was fired for violating
disciplinary rules.
   His employment status at the time of the slayings was unclear.
One witness testified he was working as a security guard and
private investigator.
   A co-defendant, Rolando Garcia, will be tried separately. Pardo
testified he killed all nine victims himself.
   ``We're very glad with the verdict,'' said Regino Muso, brother
of one of Pardo's victims. ``We can't wait until Wednesday. I hope
he gets the chair.''
   Pardo, who testified he has read 500 books on Nazism, said he's
ready for the death penalty. ``I want to die. My life's over now,''
he said.
   ``I'm going to fight for his life, whether he wants me to or
not,'' Guralnick said.

   The FBI arrested two men Friday in the
drug-related slayings of five people in a Maryland apartment Jan.
22.
   Steven McMillian, 24, and Kirk Bruce, 25, were arrested in a
raid on an apartment in the Bronx by the FBI and police, said FBI
spokesman Gary Perkins.
   The two were arrested on a federal charge of unlawful flight to
avoid prosecution, based on a murder warrant in Maryland, Perkins
said.
   An FBI source speaking on condition of anonymity said agents
confiscated a .45-caliber weapon believed to have been used in the
slayings of four men and a woman in Landover, Md.
   Police said the victims had been involved in drug trafficking
organizations since the early 1980s and were shot in the head and
chest with semi-automatic weapons.
   On Saturday, police arrested Carl Dunstrom, 28, in Brooklyn in
the slayings.
   The slayings were featured in a March 13 episode of ``America's
Most Wanted,'' a half-hour series on Fox Television in which
viewers are shown photographs and given information on fugitives
and asked to provide tips.
   Authorities in Prince George's County, Md., said last week the
show generated nearly 100 tips, but Perkins said he did not know
whether the program led to Friday's raid.

   A Japanese terrorist with links to Lebanese
Shiite Moslem extremists may have slipped out of Italy after
carrying out a car bomb attack that killed five people outside a
USO club, investigators say.
   An FBI bomb squad, meanwhile, planned to investigate whether the
explosives used in the blast are similar to bombs taken from the
car of a Japanese man arrested in New Jersey, a law enforcement
official said in Washington.
   The blast at the United Services Organization club in Naples
Thursday night killed four Italians and Angela Santos, 21, of
Ocala, Fla., a U.S. Navy radioman 3rd class based in the city.
   Two Arab groups claimed responsibiity for the attack, which also
injured 17 people, including four U.S. sailors. Naples officials
declared today a day of mourning to coincide with the funerals of
the slain Italians.
   Junzo Okudaira, a member of the Japanese Red Army terrorist
group with a 15-year history of bombing Western embassies, was
identified Friday as the prime suspect in the USO attack. Italian
investigators said he has links with Lebanon-based terrorist groups.
   Police investigators said they believe Okudaira was the man who
parked the bomb-laden car outside the club during a party for
sailors from the visiting frigates USS Paul and USS Capodanno.
   An international arrest warrant for Okudaira was issued Friday.
   Authorities said he may have gone straight to a Rome airport by
car and flown out of the country late Thursday or early Friday.
   ``A characteristic of terrorist groups in general, and the
Japanese Red Army in particular, is preparing for an escape before
the actual attack,'' said Romano Argenio, head of anti-terrorist
police in Naples.
   He said investigators believe Okudaira, 39, was acting in
concert with other international terrorist groups during the USO
attack.
   In Rome, a man speaking English with an accent telephoned a
French news agency office and said the bomb was planted by a group
called ``Organization of Jihad Brigades.'' Jihad is Arabic for
`holy war.'
   ``The American imperialists must die today, two years after
their barbarous attack against the Libyan Arab state,'' he said.
The U.S. bombing raids on April 15, 1986, were aimed at punishing
Libya for alleged involvement in international terrorism.
   In Beirut, a group calling itself ``The Islamic Jihad
Organization for the Support of the Oppressed on Earth'' claimed
responsibility in a typewritten Arabic statement to the Italian
news agency ANSA.
   Italian authorities charged Okudaira in December with carrying
out the bomb and rocket attacks in June on the U.S. and British
embassies in Rome. Several people were wounded.
   He is believed responsible for similar attacks over the past 15
years on American, French and Dutch embassies in Europe and Asia.
   Investigators said Okudaira had been in Naples for five days
before Thursday's attack, using a fake name and false Taiwanese
passport. He had rented a car at the airport, the one eventually
used for the bombing, and stayed at the modest San Pietro Hotel
near the railroad station.
   Hotel officials said he often spoke by phone in English with a
woman. Investigators said he may have had another male accomplice
as well.
   A law enforcement source in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said an FBI bomb squad left for Naples to investigate
whether the explosives used there are similar to those found in the
car of a Japanese man arrested Tuesday in New Jersey.
   State authorities detained Yu Kikumura, 35, after he was found
with three bombs in his car and a phony visa. Japan's Kyodo news
service reported that Kikumura had links to the Japanese Red Army.
   U.S. sailors, meanwhile, were ordered to remain on board the
frigates Paul and Capodanno, docked a short walk from the USO club.
Sailors wearing flak jackets and carrying rifles stood guard on the
decks.
   In Spain, a bomb exploded Friday at a U.S. Air Force radio relay
station near an air base east of Madrid but caused no injuries.
   No group claimed responsibility. A Defense Ministry official was
quoted by the Spanish news agency EFE as saying the attack could be
related to the anniversary of the Libya raids.

<HEAD>Old Emotional Wounds Reopen As Poles, Jews Discuss Nazi Occupation</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In April 1943, poorly armed fighters in
Warsaw's walled Jewish Ghetto appealed to Poles to join them in
their dignified but doomed struggle to turn back the Nazi tide.
   Forty-five years later, Poles and Jews painfully discussed the
response to that appeal during a remarkable two-day conference on
struggle and martyrdom during the Nazi occupation. Emotional wounds
reopened.
   The conference, attended by several hundred Poles and Jewish
visitors, coincided with the 45th anniversary of the Ghetto
Uprising, when Jews held off the final Nazi extermination drive for
nearly a month.
   It was attended by several Polish government ministers, senior
Polish communist party officials, Roman Catholic bishops as well as
Jews from Israel, the United States and other Western countries.
   But the discussions, onstage and in the corridors Thursday and
Friday, only showed that 45 years later, Jews and Poles still find
it difficult to talk with each other about the past.
   Israel Gutman, professor of Jewish history at the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem, took sharp issue with what he called
``disastrous'' papers by some Polish historians who claim the
predominantly Roman Catholic Poles played an active role in aiding
residents of the Jewish Ghetto.
   ``To my regret, only a very small part of that is identical with
the truth,'' he said.
   Gutman is one of the few living survivors of the uprising in
which hundreds of poorly armed Jews fought a heroic but doomed
three-week battle resisting the final Nazi drive to liquidate the
ghetto's last 70,000 inhabitants.
   ``The true picture is that until a certain period of time there
was no contact between Jews and non-Jews,'' said Gutman, who
survived Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps before
emigrating to Israel after the war.
   ``There was not help, they (Poles) did not lift a finger to help
the hungry people in the ghetto,'' Gutman in an interview later.
   In his conference paper, Gutman said the Polish underground did
not begin organized assistance for the ghetto until late 1942,
nearly two years after the Nazis sealed off nearly 450,000 Jews
within the ghetto walls.
   Most of them died of hunger, disease or in the gas chambers of
Treblinka and other death camps.
   Kazimierz Kakol, chairman of the Polish government commission
for the investigation of Nazi war crimes, blamed the Western powers
for ``remaining deaf to calls to rescue'' Polish Jews, despite
receiving reports smuggled out by the Polish underground about the
Nazi's systematic annihilation of more than three million Polish
Jews.
   ``We, Poles, did our utmost to help Jews in their hour of
death,'' Kakol said in a speech to the conference.
   ``If the assistance was little, it was because the possibilities
for assistance were so small,'' he said, stressing that Poles faced
the death penalty from their Nazi occupiers if they assisted Jews.
   Some Jews at the conference expressed outrage at what they
considered attempts to distort the picture of Polish assistance to
Jews.
   Abraham Cykiert, 62, of Melbourne, Australia, a Polish Jew who
survived the Auschwitz and Buchenwald death camps, said he returned
``to say goodbye to 1,000 years of Jewish history in Poland.
   ``They (Poles) do not realize that by trying to show more than
was done (to help) they only antagonize the Jews, who have suffered
with their pain,'' he said.
   ``They are laundering their own history here,'' said Doris
Epstein of Toronto, a psychologist who works with Holocaust
survivors.
   One Polish speaker drew applause from both Jews and Poles when
she expressed shame over an officially inspired anti-Semitic
campaign following 1968 campus protests that led to the emigration
of most of Poland's remaining Jews. Only about 10,000, mostly
elderly Jews live in Poland today.
   Irena Maciejewska, a Warsaw University faculty member, said she
felt awkward sharing the stage with ``people who injured the good
name of Poland in 1968,'' apparently referring to Kakol, a former
editor who has been linked to the purge of Jews from official posts.
   ``As a university person, I painfully remember that time and as
a Pole I should be ashamed of it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Albany Newspaper Ends 145 Years of Publication</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Knickerbocker News published its final
edition in its 145-year history, topping it with a banner headline
that read ``We Say Farewell.''
   Capital Newspapers, which published the afternoon newspaper and
the morning Times-Union, blamed the death Friday of The
Knickerbocker News on declining circulation.
   Paid circulation for the last edition was 28,000, down from a
peak of almost 70,000 in 1973.
   The departure of The Knickerbocker News leaves New York state's
capital with only one newspaper.
   The Knick, as it was known locally, began publication in 1843 as
The Albany Knickerbocker. From 1879 to 1928, when the Gannett Co.
purchased it, the paper was known as The Knickerbocker Press. It
became The Knickerbocker News in 1937. The Hearst Corp., which owns
Capital Newspapers, purchased the newspaper in 1960.
   The nearly 40 staff members who worked only for the News will
join the Times-Union, which will become an all-day newspaper
Monday, officials said. The two newspapers shared personnel in
several departments.
   Four people were laid off as a result of The Knickerbocker News'
demise and 39 took voluntary retirement, said Publisher Joseph T.
Lyons.
   ``It is a strategic marketing decision,'' Lyons said. ``It is
somewhat sad to lose a newspaper and a flag. On the other hand,
looking ahead, we're going to be able to devote our talents to a
bigger, better newspaper to serve our readers better. It's sort of
a natural evolution.''
   Current and retired staff members gathered in the newsroom
Friday, and reminisced about their years with the paper, said
afternoon News Editor Warren Carlson.
   Carlson, a staff member for 31 years, said he was too busy with
his new duties to talk much about the old days.
   ``I'm looking more ahead than back,'' said Carlson, who now is
on the Times-Union's editorial page staff. ``It's too bad, but we
know these things happen. Some of the younger people, they take it
in stride. I can't get emotional now because it's kind of hectic
right now.''

   The executive committee of Harris County's
Democratic Party on Friday stripped the newly elected chairman, a
supporter of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, of virtually all
power.
   The committee, consisting of the 664 precinct chairmen, approved
by a quick voice vote final adoption of new party bylaws initially
passed March 11 in the aftershock of Claude Jones' stunning victory
over incumbent Larry Veselka.
   The bylaws were drafted within three days of Jones' election.
   Jones won the March 8 primary with 54,394 votes, or 51 percent,
to Vesekla's 51,318 votes, or 49 percent. Veselka, an attorney,
blamed his loss on not being able to campaign because of a trial he
was handling outside Houston.
   The new bylaws give powers to the party secretary that were
previously held by the chairman, including record-keeping and
managing party finances. The secretary will be elected May 2.
   About a half-dozen supporters of Jones carried picket signs
reading, ``Larry, don't be a sore loser'' and ``Will Harris County
executives reject majority rule?'' during the meeting.
   ``I kind of expected that it would be passed,'' Jones said. ``It
passed without a quorum, so you know what that tells you.''
   On Thursday, state District Judge Melinda Harmon denied without
comment a request from Jones to block the changes in bylaws. Jones
had argued that the rule changes will interfere with his statutory
duties.
   ``There have been numerous wild and paranoid statements, making
it very clear they will do everything they can to contain me,''
Jones said Thursday.
   Jones, 40, said Friday he did not know if the issue would be
taken back to court.
   Jones, who was defeated by Veselka in 1986, said his sole
occupation is working for LaRouche. He said he staffs solicitation
booths the LaRouche organization sponsors at airports and other
public places.
   Jones said he will back the Democratic presidential nominee
although he supports LaRouche, who has accused Queen Elizabeth of
drug trafficking and espouses a quarantine of AIDS patients.

   Leaders of the Nicaraguan rebels met
arrived Friday night and began their first high-level peace talks
with the leftist government in an effort to end a war that is more
than six years old.
   The two sides began the long-awaited talks about two hours after
the Contras' arrival. None of the negotiators spoke to reporters as
they went into the meeting at the Camino Real Hotel, near the
airport about four miles north of the capital.
   The negotiators met for less than an hour and agreed to resume
discussions Saturday morning.
   Adolfo Calero, head of the rebels' umbrella group, the
Nicaraguan Resistance, led the delegation of more than 40 leaders,
which arrived on a commercial flight from San Jose, Costa Rica.
   The state-run Voice of Nicaragua, which carried details of the
rebels' arrival, said the delegation included Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro, Alfredo Cesar, Azucena Ferrey, her brother Roberto, and
Aristides Sanchez.
   It said relatives of the rebels gathered at Sandino
International Airport to see their family members, some of whom
have not been in Managua since 1979.
   Violetta Chamorro, co-owner of the opposition newspaper La
Prensa, waited with the others to see her son, Pedro Joaquin.
   The Contras also were met at the airport by Marta Sacasa,
spokeswoman for the rebels, and David Stadthagen and Jose Davila,
members of the Contra who had arrived on an earlier flight.
   The flight carrying Calero and the other leaders was delayed by
more than four hours.
   Earlier Friday, leftist youths pelted the La Prensa building
with rocks. About 300 teen-agers demonstrated outside the building.
They said they were members of a group called Sandinista Youth and
were protesting the paper's support of the Contras.
   Witnesses who insisted on anonymity said a young man was
slightly injured by a pail thrown from the roof of the building.
   La Prensa is about two miles from Managua's Sandino
International Airport and near the hotel where the Contra
delegation was to stay.
   The Interior Ministry immediately banned all demonstrations and
alcohol sales around the airport and hotel and closed the main road
to the airport.
   The high-level talks could set the stage for an end to the war
that has claimed more than 26,000 lives since it began in November
1981, according to the government.
   Agreement on the technical issues of a cease-fire was reached
during talks that ended Friday in the southern border post of
Sapoa, 90 miles from Managua, and the two sides agreed to further
technical talks at the high-level meetings.
   Details of the Sapoa talks were not made public immediately, but
in a joint communique Friday the Contra and Sandinista delegates
said ``considerable progress'' had been made on reconciling earlier
differences.
   A tenuous, 60-day cease-fire has been in force since April 1, as
part of an accord the two sides reached in earlier Sapoa talks
March 23. Under that agreement, the U.S.-backed Contras would
gather in cease-fire zones until a permanent truce was negotiated.
   But the two sides were unable to agree on important technical
issues such as verification, how the rebels would be resupplied or
whether they should be allowed to keep their weapons.
   As part of the deal, the leftist Sandinistas released 100 of the
3,200 political prisoners and rebels they hold and pledged to
release the rest gradually as the Contras gather in the cease-fire
zones.
   But the entire process has been marked by bickering, with each
side accusing the other of violating the accord.
   Contra leaders have also accused the Sandinistas of releasing
only 10 of the prisoners they wanted freed, but the Sandinistas
claimed the agreement did not specify names.
   Each side threatened to cancel the talks several times. But by
Friday they finally were able to compromise on most points.
   Friday's talks in Managua mark the first time since the war
began that the Sandinistas have allowed Contra leaders to openly
come to Managua.
   Apparently, the toughest unresolved issue concerns weapons. The
Sandinistas have insisted the rebels give up their weapons before
they can participate in the country's political activities.
   Some Contra leaders say they will never disarm and others say
they will do so only when the Nicaragua moves to democracy.
   Contra leaders claim they have about 10,000 rebels under arms.
The Sandinistas claim they have an armed force of 300,000 men and
women, including an 80,000-man army.
   The cease-fire is called for under a Central American peace plan
written by Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias.

   Updated federal guidelines on treating high
blood pressure place new emphasis on prescribing the lowest
effective doses of medication.
   The guidelines, issued Friday by a federal advisory panel, are
based on an eight-month review of the latest research and they
update recommendations last issued four years ago. They are
intended primarily for physicians.
   Abram V. Chobanian, incoming dean of the Boston University
School of Medicine, said two new classes of drugs _ so-called
calcium antagonists and enzyme inhibitors _ have been approved for
treating high blood pressure since the last report.
   But Chobanian emphasized that the updated guidelines call for

<HEAD>Army Refuses To Provide Space at Utah Base For Mormon Church</HEAD>

   The Army is refusing to provide the land or
help to build a church for Mormon employees at a Utah military
installation who claim the building they now share with other
religious groups is too small.
   ``The Army is opposed in principle to the construction and
exclusive use of a private house of worship by any religious
organization on a military installation,'' Assistant Army Secretary
Delbert L. Spurlock wrote in a letter to congressional committees.
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, had argued that better space is needed
because so many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints work at the isolated Dugway Proving Ground, which employs
about 700 Mormon workers.
   But Spurlock said in his letter, ``No statutory authority exists
which would permit this at Dugway and, if such authority were
proposed (by Congress), it would likely'' violate constitutional
provisions against the government establishment of religion.

some Easterners don't cotton to Western delicacies.

   Cuomo, however, turned down the chance to win a plate of fried

   They settled on a bet of a box of Wyoming beefsteaks against a
bushel of New York clams over the Continental Basketball
Association championship. The Wyoming Wildcatters are playing the
Albany Patroons in a best-of-seven series.
   Sullivan says he's already looking for his favorite clam chowder

   Former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's
ex-wife has begun modeling women's underwear in West Germany
because she needs the money, according to published reports.
   The mass-circulation newspaper Bild on Friday ran a picture on
its last page showing Amin's 32-year-old former wife, Sarah
Kyoloba, modeling silk underwear during what it said was a recent
fashion show.
   Bild also reported that Ms. Kyoloba, who got a divorce from Amin
in a West German court last year, was collecting about $540 in
welfare payments a month. The newspaper said she received $210 for
her first appearance as an underwear model at a recent fashion show
in Cologne.
   The Frankfurter Abendpost, another mass-circulation newspaper,
carried a similar report.
   The newspapers gave no further details. The Associated Press
attempted to contact Ms. Kyoloba by telephone, but the operator
said there was no listing under that name.
   Idi Amin was deposed as Uganda's dictator in 1979 and escaped to

   Bridges has had previous legal problems.
   In January 1987, he pleaded no contest to charges of making a
bomb threat. The charges stemmed from the bombing of an auto
customizer's car following a dispute over work done on the actor's

   A commuter plane carrying 40 people caught fire
in flight and crashed into the main terminal at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport late Friday, injuring at least 19,
authorities said.
   The twin-engine De Havilland 8 had taken off from the airport at
6:45 p.m. and returned immediately with a wing on fire, said Marlys
St. Laurent, a spokeswoman for the Port of Seattle, which operates
the airport.
   Passenger Wilma Swartzwelder of Spokane said she saw the right
engine on fire five or 10 minutes after takeoff. ``I heard the
boom,'' she said. ``They told us to put our heads down and shield
our faces. Everyone was real calm.''
   The plane hit baggage carts as it came in, then hit the ground
and careened into the terminal, said Douglas Chadd, manager of a
restaurant at the airport.
   Nineteen people were taken to hospitals, officials said.
Twenty-three others were taken to Harborview Medical Center for
observation, said spokeswoman Tina Mankowski.
   There was no immediate indication that any of the injuries were
critical, hospital officials said.
   No one on the ground was hurt, said airport Police Chief Ed
Ingram. The flight gates where the Horizon Air aircraft hit were
empty at the time. Ingram said the plane substantially damaged one
or two gates at one concourse.
   Nancy Hamilton of Horizon Air said the crash occurred on Flight
2658 from Seattle to Spokane with a capacity load of 37 passengers,
plus a pilot, copilot and flight attendant.
   The plane crashed into a passenger gate at the main terminal. A
wing slammed into a passenger ramp, while the nose poked into the
gate area. Fire trucks raced to the scene and sprayed the plane
with fire retardant.
   Cecilia Feemster of Graham said she was driving near the airport
when she saw the plane approach. ``There were flames flying from
the wing,'' she said.
   ``It barely made the hill as it came over the highway. It must
have cleared the highway by about 12 feet,'' she said. ``It was
scary.''

   Federal officials say the roundup of 20 people
in Hong Kong and the United States in the breakup of a Chinese
heroin importation ring reflects the growing influence of Asian
criminal gangs.
   Drug-importing Asian criminal gangs ``are moving in to fill the
void'' left by the successful prosecution of Sicilian Mafia members
in the United States, FBI Director William Sessions said in a
statement Friday.
   Cracking the Chinese heroin ring with a series of arrests Friday
ended a two-year undercover probe called Operation Bamboo Dragon
that was launched after federal agents were told a restaurant owner
in the Chinatown section of Washington was buying stolen firearms
and distributing cocaine.
   Eleven people were arrested in Hong Kong and nine in the United
States as investigators seized 137 pounds of heroin worthover $100
million.
   Five of those arrested in New York were charged with conspiring
to supply 1,000 M-16 military rifles to undercover federal agents
and to provide false documents so that the rifles could be shipped
to Libya, said the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
   ``This gang was capable of putting enormous firepower into the
hands of terrorists and drug smugglers,'' Customs commissioner
William von Raab said in a statement. Federal officials said at a
news conference that the ring had supplied 600 handguns, mostly to
Chinese gangs.
   The FBI and ATF inserted undercover operatives into the
operation, including a Chinese-speaking agent who portrayed himself
as a drug dealer.
   The Cantonese-speaking federal agent, Frederick Yau, met with
gang members in Washington and Hong Kong to negotiate the purchase
of heroin from Asia.
   The heroin came from Burma and China and was transported to San
Francisco and New York City's Chinatown. It also was distributed to
Newark, N.J., Alexandria, Va., and Washington.
   U.S. members of the ring were selling hundreds of stolen or
illegally obtained pistols, machine guns and rifles on the streets
of New York City, usually to Chinese gangs.
   Many of the firearms were obtained with fraudulent
identification documents from gun shops in Fort Worth, Dallas and
Houston, Texas, the officials said.
   The Chinese gangs were buying AR-15 semi-automatic rifles _ the
civilian version of the Army's M-16 rifle _ and converting them
into fully automatic M-16s.
   Customs and ATF undercover agents bought 10 weapons from the
five people charged in New York City and ordered 1,000 more M-16s
that were to be delivered to Libya. Such shipments would have
violated the Arms Export Control Act, which sets up federal
licensing procedures for the sale of weapons to foreign countries.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration was a major participant in
the probe, law enforcement officials said at a news conference in
Washington announcing the arrests.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, returning to a
state which gave his Democratic presidential campaign a short-lived
boost, insisted his issues still are potent but said he may back
another candidate ``in the near future.''
   The Missouri congressman mingled with legislators at the
Statehouse and backers at a reception Friday as he thanked Iowa
Democratic activists who handed him a victory in the Feb. 8
precinct caucuses.
   The campaign went downhill after that and Gephardt dropped from
the race. Still, Gephardt insisted his get-tough talk on trade
touches a chord with Americans.
   ``Even though we didn't get the results we wanted later in the
contest, especially on Super Tuesday, the issues we stood for ...
are still out there,'' Gephardt said. ``I believe they are issues
the American people care about.''

   The chairman of Tennessee's largest black
political organization is calling on Sen. Albert Gore Jr. to
release his delegates unless Gore gets 20 percent of the vote in
New York's presidential primary.
   James Brown, who has headed the Tennessee Voters' Council since
1985, said Friday that Jesse Jackson would get most of Gore's
416.55 publicly committed delegates if Gore released them.
   Gore campaign spokesman Arly Schardt said Gore was a ``very
viable and serious contender for the Democratic nomination'' and
had no intention of releasing his delegates.
   Brown said the TVC, long active in Tennessee Democratic
politics, sent a telegram to Gore asking him ``to make a commitment
to release his delegates without any lingering conditions if he
fails to get 20 percent of the New York popular vote on Tuesday.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has 845.15 delegates, while
Jackson has 730.1 of the 2,082 delegates required to nominate the
party's candidate at the Democratic National Convention in July.

   Gov. Richard Celeste says he organized a
federal political action committee to get young people more
involved in politics, not to launch a national political race in
the near future.
   ``This is an effort to get people to participate more
effectively in politics,'' Celeste said Friday after returning from
an overseas trade mission.
   The Columbus Dispatch reported a committee called Participation
2000 had raised more than $60,000 in the last three months. The
committee, Celeste said, was not formed to back other Democrats in
elections this fall.
   ``I think this is going to focus particularly on involving young
people in the political process,'' he said.
   Jerry M. Hultin, the committee's treasurer, said the committee
will help minority, women, and progressive Democratic candidates.
   ``It's not centered on Dick as a candidate. It's centered on
public policy and political issues,'' said Alex Shumate, a trustee
of the committee.

<HEAD>Three Days Later, U.S Sergeant Describes Alleged Intrusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran U.S. Marine sergeant's
account of his company's alleged firefight with mysterious
intruders at a fuel depot near Panama City has left unanswered a
number of major questions.
   Foremost among them: Who were the ``highly professional''
intruders he said moved in military formations, wore dark uniforms,
carried sophisticated night-vision equipment and were ``trying to
provoke'' the Marines?
   First Sgt. Alexander J. Nevglovski declined to speculate Friday
on whether the intruders he said he and his men engaged in a
two-hour firefight Tuesday night were Panamanian soldiers.
   But, asked to assess the motives and actions of intruders he
said appeared Monday and Tuesday night at the Arraijan Tank Farm
near Howard Air Force Base, the 24-year Marine veteran replied:
   ``They were training. They were using us for training aides.
They were harassing us. They were very provoking. They were
basically using us as training aides, to see how they can get
around and how they can't get around, to see how they can get
detected and how they can't get detected.''
   Col. Ron Sconyers, chief spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command, said a full investigation into the two incidents was still
under way and results would not be available for at least another
day or two.
   He said Nevglovski spoke to reporters in light of skeptical
reports in U.S. newspapers and ridicule from the Panamanian
government.
   Panama's military has described the Marines as inexperienced
troops who were ``shooting at swaying palm trees.''
   A Pentagon spokesman told reporters in Washington Tuesday that
intruders at the depot Monday night appeared to belong to Panama's
Defense Forces, which are commanded by the country's de facto
leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   A Marine corporal was killed in that incident, when he and 11
other members of his patrol tried to surround what Nevglovski
described as a group of eight intruders.
   U.S. officials said the corporal was accidentally shot by fellow
Marines.
   The Reagan administration has been trying for months to oust
Noriega, who was indicted on drug trafficking charges in Florida
two months ago. But a series of economic sanctions that have
crippled Panama's economy have failed to budge the general.
   Also Friday, Panama sent a formal protest to the United Nations
alleging U.S. troops violated its sovereignty by closing a highway
just outside the capital for three hours Tuesday night after the
alleged firefight began.
   Nevglovski told of two separate firefights Tuesday night, one
involving him and about 90 other Marines, the other involving eight
Marines and a sailor surrounded on a hill about a half mile away.
   He said he and other Marines were called to reinforce a patrol
that first sighted about 12 intruders at a fuel storage depot
shortly before sundown Tuesday. The sergeant said he later
personally counted about 40 of the unidentified men, all wearing
black uniforms.
   ``They were highly professional,'' said the sergeant, who
arrived in Panama from Camp Lejeune, N.C., last week as part of a
1,300-man U.S. military build-up. ``They were good at what they
did.''
   While Nevglovski said he had the intruders almost constantly in
view with a night-vision device, ``I didn't see a weapon on them. I
can't say why. We could see them clearly.''
   The sergeant said at least 12 of the intruders were standing in
plain view atop one of the 36 underground fuel storage tanks in the
807-acre reserve, which is only partially fenced.
   Nevglovski said he not only did not see the intruders carrying
any weapons, he could not guess what they used to open fire.
   ``We received the first three rounds and our (return) fire
lasted about 15 minutes,'' the sergeant said. ``What I could
identify was three or four (muzzle) flashes coming from a certain
area.
   ``At that time I immediately went to my machine gunner and
tapped him on the shoulder and told him to return fire,''
Nevglovski said. ``He returned fire, approximately 10 or 15
rounds.''
   Nevglovski said the intruders were headed toward his position
``in three different directions as they came down, as if to make an
encirclement. All along they had been harassing us, trying to
provoke us to open fire. But we held our ground and once we were
fired upon, we returned fire.''
   Nevglovski also said the Marines did not chase the intruders
into surrounding jungle because a month or so earlier ``two Air
Force MPs (military policemen) chased an intruder into the jungle
and one was hacked to death with a machete and the other was cut up
pretty bad.''
   No such incident has been announced by the Southern Command, and
military spokesman later said the sergeant had repeated a rumor
that had no basis in fact.

   Sam Samudio, who gained fame during the
1960s as leader of Sam the Sham and the Pharohs, says he fled rock
'n' roll to work anonymously in offshore oil fields because fast
living had drained him.
   Today, the 51-year-old composer and performer of the 1965 hit
``Wooly Bully'' preaches on the streets of Memphis.
   ``God is not in the throwaway business. He's in the renewal
business,'' Samudio said this week. ``We have a little trailer we
pull behind a pickup and we just pick a corner.''
   Samudio spends Sundays at a shelter for transients, visits
convicts in prison and preaches with a loosely organized group
called Gideon's Few, comprised largely of former drug users,
lawbreakers and ruffians.
   The group hits the rougher parts of town. On a recent outing,
the target was a residence believed to be a house of ill-fame.
   ``We went and set up on the other corner from them and just
began to share the Gospel,'' Samudio said.
   He said a life of alcohol, drugs and fast living had left him
emotionally and physically drained, and that he sat at a lonesome
Texas crossroads and prayed for a direction.
   ``I said which way do I go, Lord. Which way do I go?'' Samudio
recalled. ``It wasn't a booming voice, though God can speak in any
way he wants, but he impressed on me to go south, to head for the
water.''
   In 1979, he found work as a deckhand on an oilfield supply boat
and eventually worked his way up to crewboat captain.
   Samudio avoided telling co-workers about his rock past. He was
startled when a co-worker once stumbled up and said, ``Well, Sam
The Sham.''
   ``I said, `Why'd you call me that?' He was drunk and he said,
`Why man, didn't you ever hear of Sam The Sham? He was a rock 'n'
roll star. He died in a plane crash.'''
   Today, Samudio lives in a comfortable, working class
neighborhood with his fourth wife, Ann, and 8-year-old daughter,
Brisa. Two grown sons from a previous marriage live in other states.
   His living comes mostly from royalties for songs he has written
or recorded, as a solo artist or with ``The Pharaohs.'' Samudio
said his last major commercial job was writing two songs for ``The
Border,'' a 1982 movie starring Jack Nicholson.
   Samudio is working on a gospel album with a local group called
``The Ambassadors for Christ,'' but says the project is moving at
its own pace since it isn't aimed at making money.
   He said he recently turned down a $40,000 offer to sing ``Wooly
Bully'' for a TV wine commercial.
   Samudio explained that his ministry would suffer if he appeared
to be looking for material riches.
   ``If I go to a prison, it only takes about 30 seconds for the
people in a prison to clock you,'' he said. ``If I'm not for real,
I won't be able to fool them, and I certainly can't fool God.''

   A boy and his three teen-age sisters
were found mutilated in their home and stabbed so hard with steak
knives that the blades broke, and a jilted boyfriend of one victim
was arrested, police said.
   Leo Narvaiz, 20, was taken into custody after being treated at a
hospital for a stab wound to his thigh and a cut on the hand. He
was charged with four counts of capital murder, said Robert Grego,
court officer for Magistrate Quon Lew.
   Narvaiz was taken back to Medical Center Hospital after a
late-night hearing and will be transferred to Bexar County Jail on
$4.05 million bail, Grego said.
   Narvaiz had broken up with 17-year-old Shannon Mann in the past
three weeks and had been named in two complaints filed by the
teen-ager's father, one alleging a terroristic threat, said
homicide Lt. Albert Ortiz.
   Narvaiz also had threatened Miss Mann's new boyfriend with a
knife last month and damaged his pickup truck, the lieutenant said.
   ``He had been trying to get back with her and since he was
unable to, we figure this is what prompted him to break into the
house and commit these murders,'' Ortiz said.
   Miss Mann was found slain along with her sisters, Jenniffer, 19,
and Martha, 14, and brother Ernest, 11, in their mobile home early
Friday.
   ``We figure he either surprised them in their sleep or there's a
possibility that more than one person was involved, which would
have kept them from running out or anything like that. We can't
tell for sure,'' said Ortiz.
   Ortiz said a girl called the 911 emergency number about 3:27
a.m. and said ``one of my sister's boyfriends is beating us up and
has killed my sister.''
   Police were able to trace the call and found the bodies at 3:55
a.m., Ortiz said.
   Police said at least five steak knives were used in the slayings
and that more could have been carried off from the five-bedroom
mobile home.
   ``It's unbelievable. All of them were savagely stabbed. There
are knives broken off in their necks,'' said Sgt. George Wilson, a
28-year member of the department. ``It's a slaughterhouse.''
   Mary Mireles, who lives across from the trailer park, said there
have been numerous robberies there and that she heard a commotion
early Friday, and thought she heard gunshots.
   ``I heard a lot of screams,'' Mrs. Mireles said. ``They were
screaming, `Help' and they were crying and screaming and I told my
husband and he said, `No, let's not get involved.'''
   ``He thought they would shoot at anybody who went out to see
what was going on,'' she said.
   The 10-acre park in a quiet neighborhood has a full-patrol
security system, plus a swimming pool and well-equipped recreation
center, said Barry Byers, a supervisor for Mobile Home Park. He
described residents as middle-class. ``These people have been
screened,'' he said.
   The victims' parents, Ernest and Becky Mann, are separated. Mrs.
Mann was living with the children but was not home at the time of
the attack, police said.
   Police Lt. Weldon Stinson said officers were unable to determine
if the girls had been sexually assaulted.
   The bodies were so mutilated that police first reported that
four girls had been killed. But Mrs. Mann later confirmed that one
was a boy. She collapsed after identifying them, police said.
   At one point, the victims' father struck a television cameraman
and four officers restrained him from striking a second one.
   ``Get those cameras out of here. This is not a carnival!'' Mann
said.
   Janice Pope, a friend of the girls, said the family moved in
about a month ago and were known for throwing parties for
neighborhood friends.
   ``They loved to have fun. They just wanted some attention,'' Ms.
Pope said. ``They just wanted friends.''
   Yvonne Ochoa, 20, said she had worked with Shannon Mann at a
grocery store until Miss Mann resigned about four months ago.
   ``She wouldn't talk, but she asked me about married life and
said she was wanting to move in with her boyfriend,'' Ms. Ochoa
said. ``They were always breaking up but she said she loved him.
   ``She said that he hit her and that he also broke into her other
house but that she still wanted to marry him.''
   Darrell Flynt, principal of McCollum High School, said Shannon
withdrew from school last November as a sophomore, and Jennifer
dropped out of school in 1985 as a junior.

   The conviction of a former day-care center
teacher on 115 charges of sexually assaulting, endangering or
terrorizing 20 preschoolers was a bittersweet victory, say the
victims' parents.
   ``It didn't end today. This evil of hers has affected so many
people,'' one mother said Friday after a jury convicted Margaret
Kelly Michaels, 26, of Pittsburgh on 115 counts and acquitted her
on 16.
   Superior Court Judge William F. Harth revoked Ms. Michaels'
$25,000 bail and ordered her jailed pending sentencing on May 26.
She could be sentenced to more than 1,000 years in prison.
   Ms. Michaels was found guilty of a variety of offenses involving
children 3 to 5 years old at the now-defunct Wee Care Day Nursery
in Maplewood just west of here between October 1984, when she was
hired, and April 1985, when she resigned.
   Among other things, she had the children perform sex acts on her
with utensils, did the same to them and smeared peanut butter and
jelly on her genitals before having a child perform a sex act on
her, the jury found.
   She also was convicted on charges that cited her playing
``Jingle Bells'' on the piano nude in front of the children, making
them take part in a nude pile-up, defecating in front of the
children, and having a child urinate on her.
   ``My son still has nightmares,'' said the mother, whose
9-year-old boy was 5 when he was at the day care center. ``He still
talks about Kelly Michaels. He's still terrified about her.''
   The mother and other parents were not identified on Harth's
orders in order to protect the children.
   The jury reached its verdict after 13 days of deliberations. As
the litany of guilty verdicts was read, parents wept, as did Ms.
Michaels and one of her sisters.
   ``I'm sorry for her. But I hate her for what she did to the
children,'' said the mother of an 8-year-old girl. ``And although
I'm happy about the verdict, it's not over for the children.''
   Ms. Michaels' attorneys, Harvey Meltzer and Robert Clark, said
they would appeal.
   Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Sara Senser McArdle, who
hugged and kissed parents after the verdict, said the investigation
and trial had been difficult.
   ``We had extremely traumatized children ... who felt guilty''
that they had participated in sexual acts, Ms. McArdle told a news
conference.
   Essex County Prosecutor Herbert Tate called the children heroes,
saying they had to overcome stigma and ``cruel threats'' by Ms.
Michaels to testify.
   ``Child abuse will not go unpunished,'' said Assistant
Prosecutor Glenn D. Goldberg, who prosecuted the case with Ms.
McArdle.
   Eighteen children testified on videotape and a 19th gave
testimony recorded on audio tape. The father of a 20th child who
did not testify took the stand instead.
   Defense attorneys argued that there were inconsistencies in the
children's testimony and that they were coached on what to say.
   Ms. Michaels testified that she could not have abused the
children because of the presence of other teachers and time
constraints.
   She was convicted of 34 counts of first-degree aggravated sexual
assault, 39 counts of second-degree sexual assault, one count of
second-degree attempted aggravated assault, 39 counts of
third-degree endangering the welfare of a child and two counts of
third-degree terroristic threats.
   The first-degree convictions carry a maximum sentence of 20
years apiece, the second-degree convictions 10 years each and the
third-degree convictions five years. The second and first-degree
convictions each carry a maximum fine of $100,000 and the
third-degree convictions $7,500.

   The screams of a boy and three
teen-age sisters as they were stabbed to death with steak knives
awakened other trailer park residents, but the neighbors never
called police, authorities said today. An ex-boyfriend was arrested
in the killings.
   Leo Narvaiz, who was spurned by one of the girls, was charged
Friday with four counts of murder and one of criminal mischief.
Narvaiz, 20, was under guard at a hospital where he was treated for
a stab wound to his thigh and a cut to his hand.
   Mary Mireles said she was awakened in her home across from the
trailer park early Friday. ``I heard a lot of screams,'' she said.
``They were screaming, `Help' and they were crying and screaming
and I told my husband and he said, `No, let's not get involved.'''
   ``He thought they would shoot at anybody who went out to see
what was going on,'' Mrs. Mireles said, adding that she thought she
also heard gunshots.
   Virginia Ytuarte, a resident of the mobile home park in south
San Antonio, said her sister who was spending the night also heard
the screams.
   None of the neighbors called police, Sgt. Christopher Jackson
said today.
   Police received word of the stabbings at 3:27 a.m., when a girl
called the 911 emergency number and said, ```One of my sister's
boyfriends is beating us up and has killed my sister,''' said
homicide investigator Lt. Albert Ortiz.
   Police traced the call and found the bodies at 3:55 a.m., Ortiz
said.
   At least five steak knives were used in the slayings and more
could have been carried off from the five-bedroom mobile home,
police said. The impact of the wounds was so great that several
blades snapped off.
   ``It's unbelievable. All of them were savagely stabbed. There
are knives broken off in their necks,'' said Sgt. George Wilson, a
28-year member of the force. ``It's a slaughterhouse.''
   Killed were Shannon Mann, 17, who had been dating Narvaiz until
last month; Jennifer Mann, 19; Martha Mann, 14; and Ernest Mann, 11.
   The bodies were so mutilated that police first reported that
four girls had been killed. The victims' mother, Becky Mann,
confirmed that one was a boy, and collapsed after identifying them,
police said. Mrs. Mann was not home at the time of the slayings.
   Officers were unable to determine if the girls had been sexually
assaulted, police Lt. Weldon Stinson said.
   Narvaiz and Miss Mann had a tumultuous relationship, alternating
between marriage plans and threatened violence, according to police
and family friends.
   ``They were always breaking up, but she said she loved him,''
said Yvonne Ochoa, 20, who once worked with Shannon Mann at a
grocery store. ``She said that he hit her and that he also broke
into her other house, but that she still wanted to marry him.''
   After the couple broke up, Narvaiz threatened Miss Mann's new
boyfriend with a knife and allegedly damaged the boy's pickup
truck, police said.
   ``His girlfriend had broken up with him and he was unable to
cope with it,'' Ortiz said.
   Miss Mann's father recently filed two complaints _ one alleging
a terroristic threat _ against Narvaiz, Ortiz said.
   Janice Pope, a friend of the girls, said the family moved in
about a month ago, and that the girls were known for throwing
parties for neighborhood friends.
   ``They loved to have fun. They just wanted some attention,'' Ms.
Pope said. ``They just wanted friends.''

<HEAD>FBI Agents Head to Italy To Investigate Possible Links to Bombing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-USO Bombing, Bjt</HEAD>

   FBI agents will travel to Italy to
investigate possible links between the bombing of a USO Club in
Naples and a Japanese man arrested with three powerful bombs in New
Jersey, a law enforcement source said.
   Yu Kikumura, 35, is believed by the Japanese Foreign Ministry to
have ties to the leftist Red Army, a terrorist group linked to the
bombing which killed a U.S. servicewoman and four Italians.
   A federal magistrate here on Friday ordered Kikumura held
without bail. Kikumura was arrested by state troopers Tuesday after
being found with three sophisticated homemade bombs in his car.
   In Washington, a law enforcement source speaking on condition of
anonymity said an FBI bomb squad is on its way to Italy to
investigate whether the explosives used in the Naples bombing
Thursday match those found in New Jersey.
   FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney refused to confirm the report, but
said ``we have offered forensic and other cooperative services to
the Italian law enforcement authorities'' in connection with the
Naples bombing. He declined to elaborate.
   A terrorist task force composed of state police, FBI and U.S.
Secret Service agents is investigating Kikumura's background and is
trying to determine where he was headed when he was arrested,
authorities said.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. on Friday refused to comment
on indications that Kikumura is linked to the Red Army.
   Kikumura was arrested on the New Jersey Turnpike after a state
trooper stopped him for a routine motor vehicles violation and
found the bombs in his car.
   A state judge on Thursday released Kikumura into the custody of
federal authorities, who charged him with using a fraudulent visa
to enter the country and possession of unregistered firearms, the
explosives.
   FBI Agent Robert J. Heckman, an explosives expert leading the
investigation, described the bombs found in Kikumura's car as
``anti-personnel'' devices. Two thirds of the 18-inch containers
were packed with gunpowder and the rest with steel pellets, a
mixture that, when detonated, could blow up an average home, he
said.

<HEAD>Irish Girl Returns Home after `Miraculous' Recovery from Coma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wearing a cast and a smile, a young Irish woman
bade farewell to the country that adopted her after a St. Patrick's
Day traffic accident that put her in a coma for 10 days.
   ``I feel great, as though I haven't changed a bit,'' Margaret
Hanley, 22, said in an interview Friday shortly before leaving for
Ireland.
   Miss Hanley said she would take time while convalescing to
answer the nearly 600 letters she received from well-wishers who
heard of her plight, some as far away as New Mexico.
   After tearful goodbyes and laden with gifts, Miss Hanley left
Weiss Memorial Hospital with her parents a month later than she had
planned but much sooner than doctors and well-wishers had dared
hope.
   ``It was a miraculous recovery,'' said Dr. Richard Bigg, a
surgeon who headed the team that treated Ms. Hanley. ``Everyone is
absolutely amazed.''
   The black-haired aspiring actress came to Chicago in February to
see her boyfriend, Daniel Stokes, who is jailed on murder and armed
robbery charges in the death of his landlord.
   But she was hit by a car March 17, a day before she planned to
return to Dublin, and suffered a fractured leg and hip.
   Stokes, who has pleaded innocent, says the couple met in Dublin,
where Miss Hanley was working as an actress for his father's
theater company.
   ``I remember getting hit,'' Ms. Hanley said late Thursday. ``But
to tell you the truth, since I woke up, I don't remember a thing
about it, except I think I told the people (in the ambulance), `I
can't stay overnight _ I have to go home tomorrow.'''
   Before reaching the hospital, she slipped into a coma. Doctors
said later that the broken leg created a blockage in blood vessels
carrying oxygen to her brain.
   Her parents rushed to Chicago from Dublin and were at her
bedside 26 of her 29 days in the hospital.
   They kept a round-the-clock hospital vigil while she was
comatose, playing tapes of Irish folk music and tape-recorded
messages from her 13 brothers and sisters.
   Shortly before Easter, Ms. Hanley awoke.
   Reports of the cash-strapped family's plight brought an
outpouring of support from the local Irish community and readers
around the country.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Ms. Hanley said. ``I thought I was
just another tourist, but these people have been so nice.''
   A nurse accompanied Ms. Hanley on the return trip to Ireland at
the hospital's expense, and will help her develop an exercise
regimen to strengthen her broken leg.
   ``Everybody's been wonderful, but we miss our kids,'' said her
mother, Ann Hanley, reached at O'Hare International Airport as she,
her husband, Stephen, and their daughter prepared to leave for New
York and a connecting flight to Ireland.
   ``And to tell you the truth,'' Mrs. Hanley said. ``We could do
without all the excitement.''

<TEXT>
   A machine gun-wielding commando unit of
seven men and one woman killed PLO military commander Khalil
al-Wazir and three of his bodyguards at his suburban Tunis house
early today, PLO officials said.
   Khalil, caught reading PLO reports in his study, drew his pistol
but was sprayed with bullets, said a PLO spokesman who refused to
be identified.
   The 52-year-old Khalil, also known as Abu Jihad, was killed
about 1:15 a.m. (8:15 p.m. EDT) by commandos who drove up to the
house, shot to death a Tunisian bodyguard driver and burst inside,
where they killed Khalil's two Palestinian bodyguards, the
spokesman said.
   ``They then broke into Abu Jihad's study. Everything happened
within seconds. He had drawn his pistol to defend himself but they
mowed him down with literally hundreds of submachine-gun bullets.''
   Khalil's wife Imjihad, daughter Hannan, 14, and son Nidal, 2,
were in the house, but were not hurt, PLO officials said. Khalil's
three other children were not home.
   The PLO spokesman blamed the ``Israeli terrorists of Mossad and
their American backers who are determined to liquidate our people.''
   Mossad is the Israeli secret service, and Khalil was responsible
for the Palestine Liberation Organization's military operations
against Israel.
   Khalil was deputy military commander of the Palestinian armed
forces, behind PLO leader Yasser Arafat, a member of the PLO
executive committee and No. 2 man in Fatah, the largest branch of
the PLO, also headed by Arafat.
   He was among PLO leaders closest to Arafat and was widely
regarded as among the most moderate of PLO leaders.
   In Bahrain, diplomatic sources said Arafat was cutting short a
tour of the Persian Gulf Arab states and rushing back to Tunis.
   Arafat had been discussing means of bolstering the Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and preparing for a
pan-Arab summit proposed for the first week of June. The tour began
in Kuwait.
   Ibrahim Sousse, the PLO representative in Paris, issued a
statement blaming the assassination on Israel, which ``unable to
confront the stones of Palestinian children now has no recourse but
to resort to the arm of terrorism.''
   The statement said the killing ``will not go unpunished.''
   The PLO said in a statement issued in Tunis that the
assassination ``will not halt the determination of the Palestinian
people to pursue their struggle for the liberation of their
homeland.''
   Born in Ramallah on the West Bank, Khalil Ibrahim al-Wazir left
after the 1948 war, moving with his family to the Gaza Strip.
   Referred to mainly by his nom de guerre, Abu Jihad, he became
involved early on in the struggle against Israel and in 1954 was
briefly arrested by Egyptian authorities for involvement in
anti-Israeli operations.
   He first met Arafat in the early 1960s after moving to Kuwait.
Together, they founded Fatah. In November 1963, he moved to
Algiers, where he opened the first Fatah bureau in an Arab country.
   At the start of Fatah's military operations, in January 1965,
Khalil left Algeria for Damascus, Syria, and took charge of
communication with commando units operating in Israel.
   He later became head of military operations against Israel from
Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, just as Fatah was beginning to gain
political weight.
   When the PLO left Lebanon in 1982, Khalil went with Arafat and
other Palestinian leaders to Tunis, where the PLO established its
new headquarters.
   From 1984 to 1986, he moved to Amman, Jordan, co-presiding with
the Jordanian minister for the occupied territories over a mixed
commission to support the Palestinian population in the occupied
territories.
   He was expelled from Amman in 1986 after the PLO-Jordanian
accord established between Arafat and King Hussein was abrogated,
returning to Tunis.

<HEAD>Troops Raid Another Suspected Honasan Hideout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops raided the suspected hideout
of the fugitive leader of last August's coup attempt after
capturing 10 followers and foiling a plot to seize the presidential
palace, military officials said today. Former Lt. Col. Gregorio
Honasan was not in the hideout, an automobile repair shop in
suburban Quezon City. But authorities seized a motorcycle and
military uniforms believed used by Honasan, the officials said.
   The raids came late Friday as the military was on nationwide
alert against any coup attempt while President Corazon Aquino was
visiting China.
   Military officials, meanwhile, questioned the 10 Honasan
followers arrested in a nearby home. A broadcast executive who owns
the house where they were captured denied any links to the
renegades.
   Officials claimed Friday's raids in Quezon City foiled a plan by
Honasan and his followers to attack the presidential palace.
   Col. Emiliano Templo, commander of the raiding party, said the
plotters planned to approach the palace by rubber boats down a
tributary of the Pasig River which flows behind the palace in the
heart of Manila.
   But the military was tipped off about the plot, ``so we acted
quickly,'' Templo said. ``We pre-empted the plan.''
   Honasan led the Aug. 28 coup in which 53 people were killed and
more than 300 others wounded, including Mrs. Aquino's only son,
Benigno Aquino III.
   In Beijing today, Mrs. Aquino told reporters she was ``very
happy'' to learn of the arrests. She arrived in Hong Kong soon
after on a one-day visit.
   Honasan was arrested in December but escaped April 2 from a navy
prison ship with the help of 14 guards from an elite navy group
trained in demolition and commando attacks. Eight of those arrested
Friday were his guards. The two others were civilians.
   Lt. Anselmo Cabingan, a military spokesman, declined to give
details of the raid on the shop, but the government's television
station quoted officials as saying they believed Honasan had used a
small room there as his sleeping quarters since his escape.
   The station said that, in addition to the motorcycle, the
raiders seized black military uniforms and a gadget used in
reloading bullets.
   The shop is near the house where Honasan's followers were
arrested in suburban Quezon City.
   Officials said the group offered no resistance although they
were found in possession of 16 M-14 rifles, four M-16s, one light
machine gun, five Israeli-made Uzi machine guns, and a grenade
launcher.
   The house were they were captured belonged to Ildefonso
``Butch'' Canoy, a vice president of the Radio Mindanao Network,
one of the country's largest private broadcasting companies.
   Canoy was vacationing in New York and could not be contacted for
comment. But his network's news manager said Canoy denied any links
to Honasan's group and was surprised to hear of the raid on his
house.
   ``I talked to him by telephone and he was just as surprised as
we were,'' Mike Enriquez told The Associated Press. ``We fell off
our chairs when our guys (reporters at the scene) asked whose house
it was and were told it was Butch Canoy's.''
   He said he asked Canoy if he had given anybody permission to use
his house or if he knew that dissident soldiers were using it, and
he said ``No.''
   Canoy is related to opposition politician Reuben Canoy, who has
been advocating self-rule for the southern island Mindanao.

   A mud wall collapsed in a junior high school
dormitory, crushing nine students to death and wounding four
others, a official newspaper reported today.
   The state-run People's Daily said the boys' dormitory of the
Mianjin Junior High School in Jiangxi province collapsed Monday
night after heavy rainfall.
   The building, built in 1940, was poorly maintained, needed
repair and was considered dangerous for occupation, the paper said.
   The People's Daily said it was the second school building
collapse in the province in 16 months. An elementary school
building collapsed in January 1987, killing 28 students.
   Provincial authorities called for greater attention to the
maintenance of school buildings after the first incident, but the
paper said local authorities ignored the problem.

   Pie throws, singing mailmen and free antacid tablets greeted
frenzied procrastinators rushing to meet the midnight deadline for
filing their federal income tax returns.
   Post offices across the country were open until midnight Friday
to place the all-important April 15 postmark on tax returns, or on
envelopes containing Form 4868 requesting an automatic four-month
extension of the deadline.
   Paul Monroe, regional manager for H&R Block in Boston, said he
sees the same people every year.
   ``They look forward to the excitement of April 15th. The
adrenalin starts flowing,'' Monroe said. ``It's like a non-contact
sport.''
   In New York City, thousands of people crowded the main post
office. Many spread their receipts on benches, tables or the marble
floor, nervously glancing at the clock until they finished, then
heaving a sigh of relief, their faces glowing.
   Free antacid samples were distributed outside, and a toy office
opened an ``IRS Stress Relief Clinic'' which invited frustrated
taxpayers to come in and yell at a dummy.
   ``This is insane,'' John Zoilo said as he slaved over his
returns. ``The last time I felt this harassed was when I got
married, and that's why I'm now divorced.
   ``But I must admit, there's no better place to do this if you're
going to be late than the Eighth Avenue post office,'' he said.
``You're among thousands of procrastinators.''
   New York's Internal Revenue Service center expected to be
deluged with about 2 million tax returns today, said IRA spokesman
Neil O'Keefe. Another half-million people were expected to file for
extensions.
   Nationwide, the post office expected to handle 30 million tax
returns in the final days before the deadline, said Postal Service
consumer advocate Ann Robinson in Washington.
   Returns not postmarked by midnight could be subject to a late
filing penalty, possibly up to 25 percent of the taxes owed.
   Last-minute tax filers backed up traffic for several blocks near
Chicago's Main Post Office Friday night, but other taxpayers got a
chance to vent their anger at the IRS by throwing pies at a mock
IRS agent.
   For $1 or $2 a pie, passers-by tossed whipped-cream concoctions
in the face of Scott Goodman, part owner of the Superior Street
Cafe, who posed as IRS agent ``Shirdolph Yurback'' to raise money
for charity.
   ``You know what I'm going to do with your taxes?'' he asked one
passer-by. ``I'm going to fund a study of South American insects.''
   The woman stopped, plopped down $2 for a large pie and slammed
it at point-blank range into the mock agent's face.
   ``That felt great,'' the unidentified woman said.
   At a post office in Springfield, Mass., postal worker Bill
Mannila entertained tardy taxpayers by lip-syncing ``Return to
Sender,'' while dressed in a costume that was half Elvis Presley,
half regulation grays.
   A six-piece band of postal workers also was on hand, joined by a
postmaster who belted out ``Pennies From Heaven'' and ``King of the
Road.''
   ``It's like a zoo, but it's fun,'' said Springfield Technical
Community College Professor Bill Herd, who along with colleagues
and students helped taxpayers fill out more than 100 forms.
``People are not so mad about paying their taxes. They come in here
with a frown and they leave with a smile.''

<HEAD>Test Gear Shipped to Soviet Union for Use in Nuclear Test Ban Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIAN SPRINGS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A giant Air Force cargo jet
transporting 45 tons of sophisticated gear to a historic experiment
in the Soviet Union finished the first leg of its journey today,
officials said.
   The giant C-5B cargo jet lumbered down a rain-slick runway at a
remote desert base north of Las Vegas on Friday and headed for its
home base in Dover, Del., the first stop en route to a Soviet test
site at Semipalatinsk 2,000 miles southeast of Moscow.
   The plane reached Dover Air Force Base this morning, refueled
and continued on its journey, said Capt. Walter Thorp, a base
spokesman.
   The plane carried 12 scientists and engineers, plus equipment to
measure shafts being dug for Joint Verification Experiments, said
Roger Harrison, an assistant secretary of state, and Troy Wade,
acting assistant secretary of energy.
   The experiments are designed to demonstrate the reliability of a
technology the Reagan administration says is needed to verify the
threshold treaties, which were reached in the 1970s but never
ratified by the Senate.
   Negotiations in Geneva are expected to produce an agreement in
time for the Moscow summit at the end of May, spelling out
conditions for the experiments.
   Energy Department officials believe the tests could take place
as early as this summer, with U.S. scientists on hand to monitor a
Soviet test and Soviet scientists traveling to the Nevada Test Site
to monitor an American test.
   ``We are walking very slowly down this path,'' Nick Aquilina,
head of the DOE's Nevada Operations Office, said in Las Vegas on
Friday before the flight departed. ``We don't know if this takes us
one step closer or 10 steps closer (to a test ban). We don't know
if it's a small step or a large step.''
   The Nevada Operations Office conducts the nation's nuclear
testing program.
   Both sides claim to have observed treaties which limit tests to
no more than 150 kilotons, although the Reagan administration has
said the Soviets probably exceeded the ceiling on some tests.
   The next step would be negotiations on limiting the size and
number of tests. A complete ban on testing could come as the two
sides near completion of negotiations on eliminating nuclear
weapons, Harrison said.
   ``As long as we have to rely on nuclear weapons for our
security, we will test,'' Harrison told reporters.
   The Soviets have been pushing for a ban on testing, and
unilaterally suspended testing for 18 months ending in February
1987. The Reagan administration refused to join the moratorium.
   The equipment which left Nevada on Friday will be used for an
experiment tentatively scheduled in July to test a U.S. technique
known as CORRTEX, in which the size of a nuclear blast is measured
through a cable within 15 yards of a test shaft.
   The Soviets have balked at using CORRTEX, which stands for
Continuous Reflectometry for Radius Versus Time Experiment, saying
tests could be monitored with seismic devices at long range.
   ``Our stand is that we need on-site verification,'' Chris West,
a DOE spokesman in Las Vegas, said Friday.
   A team of 40 to 50 Americans will travel to the Soviet test site
to monitor the underground explosion of a Soviet nuclear charge
near the 150-kiloton threshold.
   A Soviet team will set up its own equipment to measure a test to
be conducted at the Nevada site, Wade said.
   Both tests are expected to be completed by mid-July, according
to arms control officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. officials had hoped to conduct the experiments in April,
but the tests were delayed by negotiations over technical details,
one official said.

on additional repair problems.
   In addition to the 15, the airline pulled five planes from
service at Washington National Airport on Friday to repair problems
found during federal inspections, said Jim Hare, Eastern station
manager at National.
   The problems with the five planes included such things as oil
leaks and worn seat belts, but none presented a safety threat,
Eastern officials said.
   However, Eastern management ordered the planes pulled because of
the intense scrutiny of Eastern by the Department of
Transportation, Hare said.
   The latest temporary groundings ordered by the Federal Aviation
Administration were in Kansas City, Mo.; Boston, St. Louis,
Tallahassee and Atlanta, union spokesmen said.
   About 400 passengers were stranded when three flights to Boston
were canceled. Two of the grounded planes had been scheduled to be
used as backups for other flights.
   Eastern and Federal Aviation Administration officials refused to
continue listing the number of planes temporarily grounded.
   ``They didn't want to see a running box score,'' FAA spokesman
John Leyden said of his department's policy change after two days.
``We'll summarize it at the end of the inspection.''
   But members of the Machinists union continued to keep the tally,
counting eight more safety violations Friday that temporarily put
planes out of service.
   ``They're calling in from around the country,'' said a union
spokesman who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
   Eastern Machinists union District President Charles E. Bryan
issued a bulletin to Eastern's 12,000 machinists urging them to
report threats some employees have said they received from
management after speaking voluntarily with FAA inspectors.
   Bryan said Eastern's sister airline, Continental, has even worse
safety problems. There are an estimated 1,000 ``minimum equipment
list'' safety violations at Continental, he said.
   Eastern and Continental are owned by Texas Air Corp., which
Bryan has repeatedly accused of skimping on maintenance.
   ``Mr. Bryan continues to spout the kind of rhetoric that he has
maintained for the many years, even prior to Texas Air's
acquisition of of Eastern,'' said Texas Air spokesman Bruce Hicks
in Houston. ``It would appear that Mr. Bryan knows as little about
the operations of Continental as he does about Eastern.''

   A gym teacher demanded her students
either run a lap around a school track or kiss her foot, according
to an angry mother who wants an apology and the instructor fired.
   Sherry Schluter said her son was one of only three students in
the class who choose to jog during the physical education class
April 8.
   ``The only time my son should have to kiss someone's foot is
when his life is being threatened,'' Mrs. Schluter said during a
Bonita Unified School District board meeting in this city about 25
miles east of Los Angeles.
   A complaint filed by Mrs. Schluter contends Kathy Stewart, an
instructor at Lone Hill Intermediate School in San Dimas, gave her
seventh-grade class the ultimatum: run or kiss.
   ``I'd like to see her apologize to the students and parents and
be terminated,'' Mrs. Schluter added at the Wednesday night meeting.
   Neither Ms. Stewart nor Adolphus D. Carter, principal of the
sixth through eighth grade Lone Hill school, returned phone calls
Friday seeking comment. Carter's secretary said they would have no
comment.
   District officials are investigating, said interim
Superintendent Mitchell Gilbert.
   Ms. Schluter told the board that other parents told her Ms.
Stewart ordered students in a gym class last year to kiss her hand
if they sought permission to use the restroom.
   ``Some of the kids took it as a joke. Some were humiliated, and
some were afraid it would affect their grades,'' Mrs. Schluter said.
   ``Last year it was her hand. This year it was her foot. Who
knows what it will be next?'' said Mrs. Schluter's husband, David.

   Robert Chambers apologized at his sentencing for
strangling an 18-year-old woman in Central Park, but conceded that
``nothing I can do or say will ever bring her back.''
   Chambers, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the so-called
``preppy murder'' trial, was sentenced Friday to five to 15 years
in prison in the Aug. 26, 1986, death of Jennifer Levin.
   ``Jennifer's looking down on us now at this circus arena,
looking and wondering why it all happened and I don't know,''
Chambers said in court Friday. ``I never wished any of this to
happen. ... I wish to apologize to the family and to her friends
for all the trouble they have gone through.''
   The sentence handed down by state Supreme Court Justice Howard
E. Bell was agreed upon by defense attorneys, prosecutors and the
family when Chambers, 21, pleaded guilty March 25.
   Meanwhile, Steven Levin released a letter he wrote to the judge
describing the agony the family has felt since the death of his
daughter.
   The Levin letter provided an instant response to the apology,
one that reflected the depth of emotion caused by Miss Levin's
death _ which Chambers initially said happened accidentally during
``rough sex'' _ and the subsequent spotlight on the family and
lives of Manhattan's affluent youths.
   ``The outrageous lie conceived by Jennifer's killer to rid
himself of all responsibility was used by his attorney to defame
the memory of our lovely child. Never left to mourn our daughter's
death in privacy, our lives became the media event of the year,''
Levin said in the 2{-page letter.
   ``How can you talk of punishment? What number of years can
equate to her senseless death?,'' Levin wrote. ``A criminal
sentence has a beginning and an end _ ours will last forever.''
   The letter concluded, ``Please do not belittle or devalue
Jennifer's life by giving Robert Chambers less than the maximum
sentence allowable under the law.''
   Despite his statement of remorse, Chambers repeatedly shook his
head in apparent disagreement with his plea and sentencing.
   ``The Levin family have gone through hell because of my actions,
and I'm sorry,'' Chambers said. ``Whoever said time heals all
wounds is definitely wrong, because how can these wounds heal?
   ``To Jennifer, nothing I can do or say will ever bring her back,
but I am sorry,'' Chambers added.

promote the passenger rail service's newest train car.
   Roger Durrett, 37, will impersonate Twain today and Sunday at
the Amtrak terminal in New Orleans as part of Amtrak's new
equipment exhibition.
   Durrett, who began studying Twain at age 17, was chosen to help
promote Amtrak and its new equipment because the author loved to
travel.

   A rose is a rose for some purposes, but
not when it comes to those used on the blanket awarded to the
winner of the Kentucky Derby.
   Kroger Inc., which makes the famed blanket of roses draped over
the Derby winner each May, has commissioned a hybridizer here to
develop the perfect bud.
   ``The garland of roses for the winner of the Kentucky Derby is
the most prestigious floral arrangement in the world,'' said Ben
Harper, Kroger's Kentucky advertising manager. ``We feel it is
important for the Kentucky Derby to have its own rose.''
   Hybridizer Von C. Weddle, 76, said finding the perfect Derby
rose may take three to five years.
   ``I hope I live so long,'' Weddle said. ``It would be a great
honor if I could get it done.''
   The rose must redefine brilliant red, Harper said. It has to be
large because it takes 550 roses to cover the blanket, which is 14
feet long and 21 inches wide. And it must be hardy because after
the roses are sewn into the blanket's satin backing, it sits for
five to six hours at Churchill Downs before it is presented to the
winner, he said.
   The rose must also be able to grow in a hothouse because a plant
that grows outdoors would not bloom in time for the Derby in the
event of a long winter.
   In his 37-year career as a rose breeder, Weddle has created 25
different varieties, including one named for Elizabeth Taylor.

   A low-pressure system funneling through New England today
produced a chilling combination of rain and snow, dumping snow from
the Great Lakes to Vermont.
   A winter storm watch was posted for Vermont, the Adirondacks,

   About 300 people staged a protest at Duke
University, saying there were not enough black faculty members and
calling the prestigious school a ``racist institution.''
   About a dozen speakers at Friday's demonstration also accused
the school of giving janitorial and food service workers inadequate
pay raises.
   Black Student Alliance Chairman Christopher Foster said that in
1968, Duke had two black faculty members. Today there are 31.
``That's not enough. We need more,'' he said.
   University President H. Keith H. Brodie told the demonstrators
that 18 blacks have been offered jobs for the fall semester and
that he supports a resolution to add 50 new black faculty members
by 1993.
   ``We are on the right track,'' Brodie said.
   The rally stemmed from a March 17 vote by the Academic Council,
which softened a resolution by the Committee on Black Faculty to
increase the number of black professors. The resolution said the
administration should require each department and program to add at
least one black faculty member by fall 1993.
   All seven committee members resigned in protest April 8. That
action generated a petition of 2,551 signatures, including
Brodie's, asking the council to reconsider at a meeting next
Thursday.
   Joseph Di Bona, an associate professor in the Education
Department who resigned from the committee, said the shortage of
black faculty members means that black Duke educators lead
``disembodied lives,'' .
   ``Structurally, this institution is a racist institution,'' said
Di Bona, who attended the protest.
   The resolution eventually passed by the Academic Council
instructed the administration to provide incentives to meet the
deadline.
   There are 758 minority students among the 6,423 undergraduates,
and 530 minorities among the 4,368 graduate and professional
students at Duke, school officials say.

   Indonesia has signed a contract to
provide 144 million condoms to Western European countries to
prevent the spread of AIDS, an official of the National Family
Planning Coordinating Board said today.
   Sutejo Mulyodiharjo, deputy head of operational activities of
the board, said the condoms would not be used within the framework
of a family planning program. They will be used to prevent AIDS
from spreading.
   He said the order came from the European Economic Community.
   Sutejo did not say how Indonesia would produce the condoms.
   Its only condom factory has a capacity of slightly less than 144
million condoms a year. Sutejo said the factory now produces around
29 million condoms a year to meet Indonesia's domestic needs.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by viruses that
cripple the victim's immune system, rendering it vulnerable to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   A Chinese television reporter was beaten by
security guards while covering a flower show, a newspaper said
today in a rare report on the activities of Chinese police.
   The Worker's Daily said Zhang Jianhua, a reporter for a
television station in Henan province was in a park just before its
annual peony show when four security guards surrounded him.
   The report said an argument ensued, but it did not say why the
guards stopped the reporter.
   Zhang showed the guards his press credentials, but one of the
guards said, ``It doesn't matter who you are.''
   One guard whipped him with a belt while another hit him over the
head with his baton. Zhang immediately collapsed, but the four
guards continued beating him.
   As they were dragging him by the collar to the park police
station, a police officer demanded that Zhang be tied up, but
several other reporters intervened.
   The paper said Zhang suffered a concussion. It did not say
whether the guards were arrested.
   News organizations in Luoyang called for respect for reporters'
rights and guarantee for reporters' safety, the report said.
   Chinese papers rarely report incidents that raise questions
about the activities of its police. The report today was unusual
because it did just that.

   A clash between local tribesmen and
paramilitary police in northwest Pakistan has left seven people
dead and 17 others injured, reports said today.
   The official news agency APP and the newspaper Frontier Post in
Peshawar said the fighting between Kukikhel tribesmen and
Pakistan's Frontier Constabulary occurred Friday near the Khyber
pass into Afghanistan.
   APP said the fighting broke out when troopers tried to dislodge
about 3,000 tribesmen who had occupied and set up barricades on
territory controlled by the military.
   The Frontier Post said the Kukikhel action was a protest over
the contabulary's attempt to set up a post in the tribal area,
which usually is self-ruled and off limits to Pakistani police.
   Neither report said whether all the dead were civilians, but the
newspaper said at least three of those seriously wounded were
constables.
   It said the paramilitary force used artillery and mortar fire in
its attempt to oust the tribesmen, who responded with automatic
weapons fire.
   Family feuds and other clashes are frequent in Pakistan's
volatile tribal areas. Nearly all men carry guns, the most popular
being Soviet Kalshnikov assault rifles.

<HEAD>Afghan Guerrillas And Refugees Denounce Geneva Accord</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   By KATHY GANNON=
   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ About 75,000 Afghan guerrillas and
refugees jammed into a sun-baked stadium today to denounce the
Geneva accord that paves the way for a Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan.
   One by one, the seven leaders of the Islamic Unity of Afghan
Mujahedeen vowed to keep on fighting until the last Soviet soldier
is gone and they have toppled Kabul's communist government.
   Resistance leaders have said they would reject any peace
agreement reached without their participation.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, Pakistan and Afghanistan
signed an agreement on Thursday that calls for Soviet troops to
begin leaving Afghanistan on May 15.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan's acting foreign minister returned from
Geneva today and predicted that Afghanistan's communist government
will fall quickly after the Soviet withdrawal.
   ``I do not have any doubt about it. (The Kabul government) has
been rejected by the people of Afghanistan,'' Zain Noorani was
quoted as saying by the official news agency APP.
   Noorani said Afghan anti-communist guerrillas control more than
80 percent of the country.
   Afghanistan's Marxist leader, Najib, has acknowledged that
Soviet-Afghan forces are weak in the Afghanistan countryside.
   In Peshawar, Ahmed Shah, a guerrilla designated by the alliance
to head an all-rebel interim government, stood in the 95-degree
heat and told the refugees his administration would soon move
inside Afghanistan. He gave no deadline.
   ``We'll stay with you in Afghanistan, in the caves and snow, not
in Pakistan,'' he said. An interpreter translated his remarks into
English.
   Three rows of turbaned, gun-toting Afghans stood in front of the
stage.
   A guard at the rear of the stage fainted. Outside the grounds, a
camel lay dead.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, a hardline guerrilla leader and current
chairman of the alliance, told the crowd the Geneva agreement
provided for the return of about 5 million Afghan refugees from
Pakistan and Iran.
   The black-bearded Hekmatyar asked for a show of hands of those
who would wait until the last Soviet was gone to return. Virtually
all hands went up.
   The leader of one of the more moderate guerrilla parties
threatened to boycott the rally if Hekmatyar tried to get a vote of
confidence for the proposed all-rebel government.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddedi recently resigned from the alliance, then
later rejoined it, in protest over the plan which he said was the
work of the hardline Moslem majority.
   Mojaddedi's Afghan National Liberation Front also is the only
alliance party to welcome the Geneva accord as flawed but useful.
   The hardliners say the accord is a sellout because the United
States failed to secure a cutoff of Moscow's military aid to the
Kabul government. Under the agreement, both the United States and
the Soviet Union can aid their respective allies in the struggle.

   About 100 people evacuated from their homes near
Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster two years ago have sneaked
back into the area where radiation levels are still above normal,
Tass said today.
   The official news agency said they are mainly elderly people who
never fully adjusted to relocation after the April 26, 1986,
nuclear reactor explosion. The accident resulted in the death of at
least 31 people and caused radiation sickness in more than 200
others.
   About 135,000 people were evacuated from an 18-mile zone around
the plant. Two of 180 settlements evacuated have been deemed safe
for rehabitation, but most evacuees are still housed in settlements
outside the danger zone.
   Tass quoted Alexei Demchenyuk, deputy head of the interior
department of the Kiev region, as saying people were returning to
their houses and farms by going around checkpoints. Tass did not
say to which settlements the people were returning.
   ``We do not have either a moral or legal right today to force
them to leave the zone,'' Demchenyuk told Tass. ``Militiamen not
only discharge their immediate functions to maintain public order,
but also help elderly people to cut firewood, repair houses and
deliver food.''
   Tass reported that there had been several cases of theft in
abandoned homes and public buildings over the two years.
   Demchenyuk said some people had attempted to smuggle 17th and
18th century icons out of the contaminated region.
   ``The radiation level of these cultural treasures exceeds
somewhat the permitted radiation standard. Therefore, the
scientists and restorers summoned to Chernobyl now work on how to
decontaminate and preserve them,'' Demchenyuk said.
   Chernobyl is about 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital of
Kiev.
   Tass said 21,000 houses and 1,500 apartments were built for the
evacuees in other parts of the Ukraine and that $1.5 billion in
compensation was given to the evacuee.
   Tass did not say how many militia patrols are assigned to the
area, but that they are responsible for ``keeping watch'' over the
radiation zone. Decontamination measures have reduced the radiation
level, Tass said, but it still is higher than normal.
   The report did not specify how high the radition level was.

   Today's assassination of the No. 2 man in
the PLO's largest branch silenced a moderate voice and deprived the
group of an heir apparent to chief Yasser Arafat.
   Khalil al-Wazir, killed by eight commandos who sprayed him with
machine gun fire early today at his suburban Tunis home, was deputy
military commander of the Palestinian Liberation Organization's
armed forces behind Arafat. Al-Wazir served as No. 2 man in the
mainstream Fatah, the largest branch of the PLO.
   PLO leaders blamed his assassination on the Israeli secret
service, but an Israeli government spokesmen said he knew nothing
of the killing.
   Al-Wazir, 52, was widely regarded as among the most moderate of
PLO leaders. A soft-spoken man, he was obeyed even by dissident
officers, who split from Fatah after feuding with Arafat.
   As Arafat's closest aide, he headed military operations inside
Israeli-occupied territories and masterminded the 4-month-old
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He was known to have
urged Palestinians in the territories not to use arms in their
fight against the Israeli occupation.
   Abu Sharif, Arafat's chief PLO spokesman, described Al-Wazir's
death as ``a great loss for the PLO.''
   Al-Wazir was the first of the three founders of Fatah to be
killed. He, Arafat and another PLO chief, Salah Khalaf, had
survived many attempts on their lives since Fatah was launched in
1964.
   Born in Ramle, now in Israel, Khalil Ibrahim al-Wazir was the
son of a bakery owner. He left the area after the 1948 Middle East
war, moving with his family to Gaza.
   He became involved early in the struggle against Israel. In
1963, he joined up with Arafat and together they founded the PLO's
mainstream Fatah guerrilla faction. He became Arafat's right-hand
man in 1967.
   Al-Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, later became head of military
operations against Israel from bases in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
   He helped build the PLO's organization in Lebanon in the 1970s,
when it became a virtual state within a state. In April 1975 when
Lebanon's civil war broke out, he commanded the Palestinian and
Lebanese Moslem forces against Israeli-backed Christians.
   When the Israeli army invaded Lebanon in 1982 to crush the PLO,
he was evacuated on the same ship with Arafat under the protection
of a U.S. Marine force.
   He then went with Arafat and other Palestinian leaders to Tunis,
where the PLO established its new headquarters.
   Al-Wazir was credited with re-building Palestinian guerrilla
strength in Lebanon.
   His wife Imjihad, daughter Hannan, 14, and son Nidal, 2, were in
the house in suburban Tunis early today when the commandos burst
in. But the relatives were not hurt, PLO officials said.

   Kanzaburo Nakamura, a leading kabuki actor and
recipient of cultural awards from the government, died of a heart
attack today, kabuki officials said. He was 78.
   Nakamura, whose real name was Seiji Namino, was active in
promoting kabuki overseas and led a troupe of actors to New York in
1960 during the theater's U.S. debut. He also had performed in
Europe.
   Nakamura debuted on the stage in 1916. In 1980, he received an
Order of Culture award from the Japanese government for his
contribution to the art form and was designated a ``holder of
important intangible cultural properties.''
   Kabuki, a highly stylized form of drama, originated in 1603 in
Kyoto and is performed solely by men.
   Nakamura is survived by his wife, Hisae, and three children.

   Two American plastic surgeons who
recently visited Vietnam agreed to a three-year program of
cooperation with Vietnamese doctors, the official Vietnam News
Agency reported.
   The report said that during their visit, John D. Constable, of
Boston University, and Michael H. Moises, of the University of New
Orleans, performed a number of reconstructive face operations with
Vietnamese surgeons.
   The report, dated Friday and seen in Bangkok today, said the
three-year program involved research on and treatment of cleft lip
and cleft palate.
   They agreed to train personnel and to exchange results of
research, it said.
   The surgeons visited Vietnam from March 22 to April 1 as part of
an agreement between Hanoi's Maxillo-Facial Institute and the
private U.S. Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation
with Vietnam.
   Since last August, the United States government also has
dispatched medical teams to Vietnam on four occasions to explore
the needs of disabled war veterans and others. Vietnam in return
pledged to speed up efforts to account for Americans missing in the
Vietnam war.

<HEAD>Challenge Or Last Hurrah: Tony Benn Runs For Labor Leadership</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tony Benn, the aristocrat-turned-dean of the
radical left, is running for the leadership of the Labor Party in a
contest that could determine whether the socialists still can
topple Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock appears certain to defeat Benn, but he
needs a big win to demonstrate he has led the party away from the
left-wing radicalism that has helped it lose three successive
elections.
   When Benn, 63, announced last month that he will contest the
leadership at the party's autumn conference, Kinnock called it
``selfish and futile.''
   Kinnock saw the challenge as a blow to his drive to woo back
blue-collar and middle-class voters who have deserted to Mrs.
Thatcher's Conservative Party. But there are signs now that Kinnock
is relishing the contest as an opportunity to hand the left a
decisive, public defeat.
   ``I didn't choose this (contest),'' Kinnock, 46, said in a
television interview. ``But I shall fight it and win it in a way
that will bring strength and credibility to the Labor Party.''
   The opening salvos attracted the kind of publicity Labor
moderates dread: Benn back on prime time television with his calls
for class struggle, newspapers mulling over his demands for state
control of the economy, renewed trade union militancy, the closure
of U.S. military bases and the removal of Britain from NATO.
   In a party that lost power to Mrs. Thatcher nearly a decade ago,
Benn, a former energy secretary, is one of a diminishing band of
opposition members of Parliament who have held high government
office.
   Born Anthony Wedgwood Benn, he inherited the title Viscount
Stansgate but renounced it in 1963.
   A pipe-puffing intellectual with a mischievous wit and brilliant
oratorical style, Benn once was seen as a prime
minister-in-waiting. In 1981 he came within half a percentage point
of defeating Denis Healey for the Labor deputy leadership.
   Benn now appears likely to get around 20 percent of the vote by
an electoral college made up of union leaders, members of
Parliament and branch leaders.
   It is a mark of how far Kinnock, a Welsh miner's son and former
leftist, has shifted the party since taking over in 1983.
   Benn, who sees himself as the bulwark against Mrs. Thatcher's
stated aim of burying socialism, maintains that Labor loses because
it is trying to ape her capitalist doctrine instead of siding
squarely with left-wing causes. It is an argument that infuriates
Labor moderates.
   ``There's got to be a much stronger commitment to people in
struggle _ much, much stronger,'' says Benn.
   He accuses Kinnock of distancing the party from strikes by
miners, teachers, printers and health workers. ``You can't ask
people to support you on polling day if you don't support them when
they're on picket lines.''
   Benn is running with another veteran left-winger, Eric Heffer,
who is one of two candidates trying to unseat deputy leader Roy
Hattersley, a moderate.
   Labor's showing in June 1987, when Mrs. Thatcher won a third
five-year term, improved only marginally from the previous election
in 1983. Labor won 31 percent of the vote compared with the
Conservatives' 42 percent, while centrists and minority regional
parties took the rest.
   Benn made his challenge for the leadership when it appeared
Kinnock was shifting further to the right.
   A preliminary report on a wholesale review of Labor policies
ordered by Kinnock is due in the summer.
   Party left-wingers suspect Labor is about to ditch, or at least
fudge, its pledge to dismantle Britain's nuclear arsenal and shut
down U.S. nuclear bases, and will leave intact some major Thatcher
changes, such as selling off state-owned industries.
   Many analysts see Benn's move as offering a new opportunity for
the party. Splits among the centrist factions have re-established
Labor as the only credible challenger to the Tories, but it remains
five to 10 points behind the Conservatives in poll ratings.
   Labor also hopes to benefit from Mrs. Thatcher's controversial
third-term program of shaking up the welfare system and imposing
unpopular new property taxes.
   ``Labor now has some chance of reuniting the center-left into an
electable coalition,'' commented the respected weekly The
Economist. ``The challenge for Labor's leadership from the failed
old man of the left, Mr. Tony Benn, ought to provide Mr. Neil
Kinnock with a golden opportunity.''

<HEAD>Boy Crossing Tracks On A Dare Killed By Train</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old boy trying to beat a
freight train across railroad tracks was tossed about 100 feet and
killed by the train's engine, witnesses said.
   Joshua D. Bischoff and three other boys were playing a ``game of
chicken'' Friday afternoon, daring one another to cross the track
on bicycles as the train drew closer, witnesses said.
   ``You could tell they knew better not to do it,'' said Chris
Harrington, an Eden Prairie High School senior who saw the
accident. ``The first two boys to cross were dangerously close to
being hit. They just made it.''
   The engineer told police the train sounded a warning horn as it
rolled along the track at between 30 and 40 mph, according to Lt.
Les Bridger of the Eden Prairie Police Department.
   ``Then they locked the brakes as they realized what was
happening ahead of them,'' Bridger said. ``But you don't stop a
train on a dime. It took another several hundred feet for the train
to stop.''
   Bischoff, who was trying to cross the track on his bicycle, was
thrown about 100 feet down the track and then run over by the
engine, Harrington said. His small dirt-type bicycle landed in
pieces near him.
   The boy, who was a student at Prairie View Elementary School,
was returning with his brother and a friend from a book fair held
at the school, said his father, Doug Bischoff.
   ``I don't think it was a game of chicken they were playing,''
his father said. ``My oldest boy was there and he would not do that
and their friend would not do that, either.
   ``All I can think is that he decided to try to get across the
tracks and then didn't make it. The best I can say is he was just
going to beat the train across the tracks.''
   The accident is under investigation by the Eden Prairie Police
Department.

   ``Wife of four-fingered man has scrap
wood and old table saw FREE. You haul.''
   Zollie Evans' wife, Frances, put that ad in the Loveland
Reporter-Herald classifieds on Thursday.
   Evans, 69, accidentally cut off part of his right thumb with the
saw last spring, and he hasn't used the saw since.
   ``You know what they say about where a young man's fancy turns
in the spring. An old man's fancy turns to saws and wood. I
thought, `Oh my God, I have to get rid of it,''' Mrs. Evans said.
   The saw is homemade, and Evans attached it to a wheeled cart to
make it portable.
   ``It's ideal for a good carpenter,'' said Evans, a retired Air
Force serviceman.
   Evans used the saw to cut timbers for a storage shed, a family
room and covererd porch. Last year he was cutting wood for a window
frame when he stooped to pluck something from the ground, looked up
and discovered the top part of his thumb missing.
   Evans said he plans to ``relax and cut the grass'' when not busy
with his new hobby _ hooking rugs.
   ``Somebody can take that and do pretty well,'' Evans said,
looking wistfully at the saw. ``Until he cuts his finger off, too.''

<HEAD>Saddened By Funerals, Priest Asks Parishioners To Turn In Their
Guns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A priest dismayed by two funerals for gunshot
victims has asked parishioners to turn in their weapons and pledge
that they won't carry guns.
   ``Why do people need a gun on their hips? This isn't Tombstone.
Why do they need a gun under the seat of the car when they go to
King Soopers?'' asked the Rev. Marshall Gourley.
   Gourley began focusing on guns in January after the church had
two funerals for gunshot victims. One was a young man carrying a
gun who was shot by police. The other was a suicide victim.
   Gourley, pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Roman Catholic Church,
wants church members and ``everyone else of goodwill'' in Denver to
turn in their pistols, rifles and shotguns.
   He also is asking parishioners to sign pledge cards that they
won't carry guns or have them in their vehicles or in their homes,
unless they are used for hunting.
   ``And they'd better be hunting wild animals, not their
neighbors,'' he said.
   As of last week, he said, more than 400 pledge cars and eight
guns have been turned in to the parish. He said the weapons will be
handed over to the police department.
   ``That's eight guns less out there,'' Gourley said.
   Gourley suggested that those who want to keep their guns should
attend every rosary and every funeral for gunshot victims the
church holds between now and next Easter.
   ``If they still think guns are a good idea, maybe they can
convince me,'' he said.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. policy has been buffeted
in recent weeks throughout Central America, prompting suggestions
that Washington's goals in the critical region ignore local
aspirations and feelings.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte's government in El Salvador,
given full U.S. support since it took office in 1984, suffered a
humiliating defeat last month in legislative and municipal
elections.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriego, although described as a ``tinhorn''
in Washington, has taken the Reagan administration's best punches
and still runs Panama.
   In Honduras, long considered the strongest U.S. ally in the
region, the American consulate was sacked and burned by a mob
angered by what was seen as high-handedness from Washington.
   The Reagan administration's goal of bringing down the leftist
Sandinista government in Nicaragua has all but crumbled because
Congress ended military aid to the Contra rebels and the two sides
now are trying to negotiate a peace agreement.
   A South American ambassador to El Salvador told The Associated
Press privately he believes Washington's recent problems are at
least partially due to security concerns that isolate U.S.
diplomats from their surroundings.
   ``They live in bunkers and when they emerge they're surrounded
by bodyguards,'' he said, with the result that ``they cannot get a
feel for people's concerns and feelings.'' The diplomat represents
a nation friendly to Washington and has served in five Latin
American countries.
   Michael O'Brien, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Honduras,
said last week that U.S. diplomats were ``somewhat surprised'' by
the ferocity of the April 7 attack on the consulate.
   The building was burned by a mob infuriated by the arrest and
expulsion two days earlier of a Honduran facing narcotics and
murder charges in the United States.
   Honduran forces worked closely with U.S. authorities in the
operation against Juan Ramon Matta, which violated a constitutional
provision that prohibits extradition of Honduran citizens. Matta
now is in a federal prison at Marion, Ill.
   Many Hondurans view the episode as evidence that U.S. interests
in Honduras carry more weight than the nation's own institutions.
   Resentment of the United States has been growing for years in
Honduras. O'Brien and Honduran authorities say the rioters
represented a small radical minority, but for a year before the
attack the scrawled slogan ``Yankee Get Out!'' had proliferated on
walls in Tegucigalpa, the capital.
   A sore point with many Hondurans is what they consider a loss of
sovereignty caused by the Reagan administration's use of their
nation as a surrogate in its Nicaragua policy.
   ``This country has allowed its territory to be converted into a
sanctuary for irregular forces attacking a neighboring country with
which we're not at war,'' Anibal Puerto, vice president of the
Honduran Human Rights Commission, said in an interview.
   ``This raises the question of the allegiance of the Honduran
armed forces. Everything leads one to believe they are loyal to the
government of the United States rather than to their own people.''
   In El Salvador, political leader Alfredo Cristiani accused
Washington of trying to impose solutions that do not suit local
circumstances.
   Cristiani, president of the rightist Republican National
Alliance that beat Duarte's Christian Democrats in the March 20
elections, referred in an interview to U.S.-designed agrarian
reform that has gone nowhere.
   ``It is not right that U.S. professors with land reform
experience in other contexts come here and destroy an entire
agrarian system for a political end,'' he said. ``That is the great
mistake, trying to experiment without really knowing much about El
Salvador. This creates resentment.''
   U.S. policymakers clearly miscalculated about Panama. Since
Washington cast its lot with Eric Arturo Delvalle, the figurehead
civilian president Noriega pushed aside Feb. 26, administration
officials have been predicting the general would abandon power in a
matter of days. That was seven weeks ago.
   Harsh U.S. economic sanctions imposed in the effort to force
Noriega out have crippled the economy, hurting ordinary people the
most.
   American military reinforcements sent to improve security for
the Panama Canal accidentally shot one of their own men to death
last week, a result of increasing edginess caused by the extended
crisis.

   A company that charged would-be movie stars
$25 to be interviewed for a role in a horror movie is a phony and
should be closed down, the state attorney general's office said.
   Rocky Mountain Central Casting Co. is believed to have run
similar operations in eight other states, said Jan Margosian, a
spokeswoman for the state Department of Justice, which filed a
lawsuit Friday.
   She said the company told prospective clients it was
interviewing people _ for a fee of $25 _ for a role in a horror
movie called ``The Closet'' to be produced by Osmond Studios in
Orem, Utah.
   However, no such movie was planned, according to Jimmie Osmond,
a spokesman for the studios.
   The lawsuit, filed in Marion County Circuit Court, named as
defendants Royal, Joyce and Chris Christenson, operators of Rocky
Mountain Central Casting.
   The lawsuit said the company is a Wyoming corporation but is not
registered to do business in Oregon.

   A senior at St. Vincent College accused of
fabricating data for a research program is suing to prevent
officials there from telling medical schools about the incident,
according to published reports.
   The 21-year-old biology major, identified only as ``J.C.'' in
the suit, denies he made up the information. He originally received
an A on the project, but the grade was dropped to an F after
another professor challenged the work, The Pittsburgh Press
reported Friday.
   The college wants to revoke a recommendation its
pre-professional committee sent to medical school on the student's
behalf, including one school that has accepted the student.
   Revoking the recommendation might cause the student ``to forever
lose his opportunity to attend medical school,'' the student and
his parents claim in a lawsuit filed last month.
   Court papers indicate the student challenged the failing grade
during two hearings at St. Vincent, but the college would not
change it.
   St. Vincent spokesman Don Orlando declined to comment Friday. A
court hearing is scheduled Tuesday.

   A proposed ``Christian blood bank'' won't

   Dr. Condon Hughes, proponent of the idea, said Friday that
letters explaining his proposal were mailed to 40 hospitals and 175
churches in the state, but Hughes said he received positive
responses from only three churches.
   ``That's not enough to make it work,'' he said.
   Hughes said he will continue looking for the ``right place and

Lifeblood. Under his plan, it would have accepted blood only from
donors who signed a statement confirming that they have either
abstained from sex or have been faithful to a faithful spouse since
1977.
   These donors, Hughes claims, would not carry the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome virus. Officials of other blood banks had
objected, saying that all blood banks screen potential donors and
test donated blood for evidence of the AIDS virus.

   Navy divers detonated two mines
in the central Persian Gulf today while U.S. mine sweepers and
helicopters searched for more explosives.
   Meanwhile, an American warship disabled by a mine Thursday
reached port. Ten sailors were hurt in that blast, the first mining
of a U.S. warship in the gulf.
   The U.S. Navy has found and destroyed 45 mines in the gulf since
June, all the same type Iran has placed. Iran and Iraq are fighting
a 7{-year-old war and have attacked shipping in the gulf.
   In Bahrain, shipping executives said today that a navigational
hazard area had been declared within 10 miles of Thursday's
explosion.
   Western diplomats and the executives, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Iran recently laid the mines in the area.
   ``The shipping channel is frequented by the U.S. Navy and the
implication is that the Iranians have laid the mines for the
Americans,'' said one of the executives.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke of the Joint Task
Force Middle East, indicated Friday that ``strong evidence''
indicated the mines ``came from the same source'' as the ones the
Navy found in September.
   Van Dyke was referring to an Iranian boat, Iran Ajr, which was
caught laying mines in the central gulf Sept. 21. It was attacked
and disabled by U.S. helicopters and nine other mines were found on
the deck of the craft.
   U.S. officers said that Marine helicopters spotted the two mines
Friday in the waters where the 3,700-ton guided missile frigate,
Samuel B. Roberts, struck the underwater explosive, injuring 10 of
the warship's 225 men.
   Van Dyke said the mooring cables appeared new and the mines
themselves had no growth or barnacles. He said that showed that
they had been in the water ``a reasonably short amount of time.''
   The 445-foot Samuel B. Roberts, its stern low in the water and
its steel skin rippled and bent by the force of the blast, reached
Dubai, the capital of the United Arab Emirates near the mouth of
the Gulf, under tow today.
   Navy officials said four of the injured were relayed by
helicopter to a hospital in Bahrain. Three were suffering from
serious burns and the fourth from smoke inhalation.
   Six others returned to the Roberts.
   Van Dyke said the ship was ``currently considered stable.''
   Asked about possible U.S. retaliation for the mining, Van Dyke
said, ``It would not be appropriate to comment on that.''
   The Newport, R.I.-based ship, on assignment in the gulf, hit the
mine about 55 miles east northeast of the Qatar Peninsula.
   The waters where the Roberts was hit make up a a major shipping
lane used by commercial vessels, including Kuwaiti tankers. The
tankers were reflagged by the United States in July 1987 for
protection from Iranian attack.

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of a pet lion that attacked
an 8-year-old girl at a Houston flea market has been convicted of
injury to a child.
   Gary Durkovitz, 35, of Houston, owner of a 350-pound lion, faces
up to 10 years in prison and a $5,000 fine when the sentence is
handed down Monday. He was found guilty Friday after jurors
deliberated about five hours.
   Durkovitz's attorney, Robert Scardino, said he would appeal.
   ``There just weren't facts there to prove a crime had been
committed,'' Scardino said.
   Durkovitz was charged after his lion mauled Roxanne Hernandez at
the Texas Flea Market in Houston on Oct. 10, 1987. The lion was
part of an exhibit and was being led out of the building when the
attack occurred.
   A flea market security guard shot the lion as the animal bit the
little girl's head, exposing part of her brain.
   During the five-day trial, Durkovitz said he did not know the
lion was dangerous and had taken all possible precautions to
prevent an attack. But the animal's previous owner testified that
he had warned Durkovitz that he was selling the animal because it
had bitten his children.
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Alice Brown said
during closing arguments Friday that Durkovitz knew the lion was
dangerous.
   ``I tell you now. This beastmaster was playing Russian roulette
with the lives of our children, with the lives of our public,'' Ms.
Brown said.
   Roxanne's mother, Sonia Hernandez, testified that her daughter
faces more operations and that her academic performance has
declined.

   Jerzy Kosinski, once one of official
Poland's most reviled authors, had the sweet revenge of being feted
and showered with praise during a triumphal return to the country
he fled 31 years ago.
   The creator of ``The Painted Bird'' and ``Being There''
delivered a vibrant message of intellectual independence to crowds
who packed the auditoriums wherever he appeared last week.
   Speaking in flawless Polish, the U.S. writer of Polish-Jewish
descent stressed the relationship between Poles and Jews over the
centuries, condemned prejudice against Poles and Jews, blasted the
official critics who pilloried his reputation here the late 1960s
and bemoaned economic conditions in Poland.
   Cutting a lithe, elegant figure, the 55-year-old Kosinski was by
turns tragic and comic. His outrageous statements, rich wordplay
and puns quickly won over his audiences.
   Judging by the 180-degree turnabout by the authorities, he
seemed to be having the same effect on them.
   Before his scheduled departure Sunday, he had promises that
Poland would publish his nine novels and won agreement to build an
Institution of Polish-Jewish Heritage in Kazimierz, the ancient
Jewish quarter of Krakow.
   But Kosinski, speaking with American and British reporters
Friday, said he has a healthy skepticism of official promises.
   ``We are living in a country in which all plans, five-year
plans, seven-year plans, 10-year plans, have all been very
definite,'' he joked. He said he will believe his books are to be
officially brought out in Polish only ``when I see them published
in more than five copies, and not mimeographed.''
   Kosinski, who left his native city of Lodz for the United State
in 1957, came back April 6. His visit coincided with observances of
the 45th anniversary of the doomed Warsaw Jewish Ghetto Uprising
that preceded the Nazi eradication of all but a few traces of
Jewish life in Poland's capital.
   But he stressed that he had not come to Poland solely to mourn
the dead. He objected to the ``deification'' of the Jewish
Holocaust.
   Considering history ``only from the point of view of a four-year
drama, in relation to 1,000 years of (Polish-Jewish cultural)
development, is for me, a man who genuinely loves life,
unacceptable,'' he said.
   He went to Auschwitz to show it to his wife, but he devoted more
time to visiting sites of former Jewish life in Poland: Kazimierz
in Krakow, the old Jewish quarter of Lublin in eastern Poland and
his former home of Lodz, a textile center.
   There he met his brother by adoption for the first time in 30
years. While in Poland, he also renewed close friendships from his
student days.
   Only two relatives of Kosinski survived the Nazi occupation of
World War II. He said he survived thanks to Poles whose names he
does not know. He was 24 when he left the country, a promising
photographer and a sociologist who wanted to become a novelist.
   Asked about views that Poland is a land of anti-Semitism, he
said: ``This is disgusting.''
   ``I know enough about my history to say this. If they, if the
architects of disaster, the Germans and the Nazis, are to be called
anti-Semites, then those (Poles) who spat at me occasionally or
even pogromized me, historically speaking, clearly should be called
by another name.
   ``To have the same name for those who burned my relatives in
Auschwitz _ that's not a Polish name _ to have the same term for
them ... is simply unfair, as unfair as anything I can think of.''
   But Kosinski's voice rose to greatest emotion when he discussed
his own literary exile from his native land, where no books by him
have been published official and only fragments published in the
underground press. He had been attacked as a traitor to Poland for
the brutal images in ``The Painted Bird,'' which reviewers assumed
referred to Poland.
   ``It is an injustice that a man named Jerzy Kosinski, who goes
to the United States and becomes a writer there, and is not a
politician and is clearly apolitical, that this man is not allowed
to return to his own country.''
   Polish journalists frequently asked Kosinski about his decision
to write in English, which he said now puts him in the odd position
of being translated into his native tongue. He said it was largely
a pragmatic choice motivated by his desire to be read in his
adopted country.
   But he said writing in English is an emotional filter for him.
   ``The English language was necessary to create an emotional
distance between myself and the other Jerzy Kosinski, who maybe
could write the book in Polish. But could he? Maybe he would
shudder that he had lived through that war in Polish, and not want
to write. About himself.''
   He said he saw are promising signs of increasing literary
freedom in Poland.
   But he noted the continued ban of the Polish section of the
international PEN writers club since Poland's 1981 martial-law
crackdown and said he has reason to doubt the authorities'
sincerity. Kosinski served two terms as the president of the
American PEN.
   ``It's been 30 years of these authorities and I still have no
trust of them,'' he said.
   ``I know almost nothing (about those in power now) but what the
authorities used to write about me was fiction, and I do know
something about that because I am an expert on writing fiction.''
   Still, said Kosinski, he has been ``very much at home'' during
his visit, ``very much in love with the country thanks to my Polish
nature ... and at the same time very much like a foreigner.''

   U.S. failure to oust Panamanian strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega is increasing calls from members of
Congress, Central American leaders and outside experts for a
negotiated solution to the Panama crisis.
   Administration officials also are listing negotiations as one of
several options but they remain hopeful that Panama's severe cash
shortage and continued payless paydays for thousands of government
workers still will induce Noriega to depart.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias said during a visit to
Washington last week that the economic sanctions the United States
has imposed have punished the Panamanian people more than they have
military chief Noriega.
   Arias is the author of a plan to bring peace to Nicaragua and
other Central American countries and has been involved in an effort
to resolve the crisis in Panama.
   He recommended a negotiated settlement and said that the United
States should cooperate with other Central American countries in
finding a solution. Unilateral action only leaves the Reagan
administration isolated, said Arias.
   Former President Richard M. Nixon said he, too, believes broader
action by Latin American nations offers the best hope for a
solution.
   Following a briefing Thursday by State Department and Pentagon
officials, Senate Foreign Relations Committee members generally
agreed the administration must do more to seek a diplomatic
solution.
   This view was shared by committee chairman Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I. and Sens. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan. and John Kerry, D-Mass.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., sent a letter to
President Reagan asking that U.S. policy give greater emphasis to
the common hemispheric interest in combatting drugs. Noriega has
been indicted in the United States on drug charges, and has been
accused of turning his country into a haven for drug traffickers.
   Sol Linowitz, a former ambassador to the Organization of
American States who helped negotiate the Panama Canal treaties,
said, ``We've got to stop acting as if we can do it alone.''
   Linowitz urged that the United States get behind a diplomatic
effort begun last month by Arias, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez and former presidents Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica, Carlos
Andres Perez of Venezuela and Alfonso Lopez Michelson of Colombia.
   He expressed hope that a solution could be worked out with the
help of Panamanian Archbishop Marcos A. McGrath, who offered last
month to act as a mediator but backed off from the role after he
was unable to get the government and the opposition together.
   Noriega has clung to power despite strikes, demonstrations,
defections, a coup attempt by disaffected military officers, and,
most importantly, a severe economic slowdown to which the United
States has been a major contributor.
   U.S. officials believe that the Panamanian government's
inability to meet its payroll for more than a month is the single
most potent force working against his continued rule.
   Additional U.S. sanctions are being contemplated but Linowitz
believes the administration has gone too far already.
   ``There is no guarantee that more pressure will drive Noriega
from power,'' he said. The consensus in Latin America is that the
United States should reverse the sanctions it has imposed on
grounds that these measures are ``coercive'' and therefore
inappropriate.
   A former U.S. ambassador to Panama, Ambler Moss, said the
administration has pursued its policies in a ``typically
hegemonistic'' way. He agreed with Linowitz that Latin American
countries would be useful in the search for a negotiated solution.
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said that among the
options still not ruled out is sounding out Noriega on his proposal
to leave his post as commander of the Defense Forces before
elections scheduled for next year provided opposition groups agree
to a ``national dialogue'' with the government.
   The official gave the impression this option is being held in
reserve for the time being. A more likely course of action over the
short term is a U.S. attempt to devise a strategy that will enable
opposition groups in Panama to carry out their struggle more
effectively, he said.
   Some State Department officials, exasperated by Noriega's
resilience, are urging military action to remove him but the
Pentagon is generally hostile to the idea.
   Arias warned against such action during his visit.
   Nixon said he believes that option is unwise because it would
generate an anti-American reaction throughout Latin America.
   Former White House aide Patrick Buchanan wrote last week that
sending the Marines into Panama is the wrong way to fight drug
smuggling.
   If the U.S. refuses to deal seriously with the drug problem at
home, Buchanan asked, ``why should American Marines risk their
lives, to take lives, in the jungles of Panama?''
   But Michael G. Wilson, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative research group, believes military force would be
warranted under certain conditions.
   ``We should let Noriega realize that if he makes any wrong move
toward U.S. citizens, U.S. bases or the canal, or even against the
Panamanian opposition, we would be willing to consider a surgical
strike against him,'' he said.

   A cross was burned early Saturday near
the home of a white woman living with a black man in what a fire
official said was the third ``racially motivated'' incident
directed against the couple.
   Although the Ku Klux Klan has held rallies in this part of
northeastern Maryland, officials do not know if the Klan was
involved, said Bob Thomas, state fire marshal's spokesman.
   In two previous incidents, relatives of the woman were
suspected, according to a state police officer who declined to be
identified. However, there is not necessarily a connection between
Saturday's cross burning and previous harassment, the officer said.
   Police were looking for two white men in their early 20s, Thomas
said.
   The woman discovered the 8 foot by 6 foot cross before dawn,
Thomas said. The timbers were wrapped with cloth, doused with a
flammable liquid, and then set afire next to the driveway, Thomas
said.
   Thomas said last month someone shot at the couple's car and
there was another assault, but had no further details.

<HEAD>Likely GOP Nominee Bush Hoping to Share Political Limelight With
Democrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the three Democratic contenders are
battling to the wire for votes in Tuesday's New York primary,
Republican George Bush has the luxury of sitting back and watching
his delegates pile up.
   Bush can receive as many as 96 delegates in Tuesday's contest
(of which he already has 48 committed), raising his total to a
potential 970 and moving him ever closer to the 1,139 needed for
the GOP nomination.
   However, Bush strategists says that while the vice president is
running virtually unopposed, he plans to spend considerable time
campaigning in the months ahead in delegate-rich states.
   Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y., Bush's New York campaign chairman,
said that Bush will likely return to the state two or three more
times between now and the August convention.
   Bush spent three days campaigning leisurely in New York last
week, including stops in Syracuse, Buffalo, Rochester and New York
City.
   Molinari said the withdrawal from the race of Bush's only
remaining major opponent, Sen. Bob Dole, ``changed the itinerary
somewhat. The vice president cut back days.''
   But he said that Bush's visit was helpful in shoring up GOP
support and in giving the vice president some visibility in the
state to help offset the constant coverage that has gone to
Democrats Michael Dukakis, Sen. Albert Gore Jr., and Jesse Jackson.
   Bush planned to campaign in Ohio on Monday and Pennsylavnia on
Tuesday, and then spend several days back in Washington. He will
spend considerable time next month on the West Coast, much of it in
California, aides said.
   The candidacy of former television evangelist Pat Robertson,
however, continues to stand between Bush and a total lock on the
GOP nomination _ and may also be helping to keep President Reagan
on the sidelines for the time being.
   Reagan had vowed to remain neutral as long as there was a
contest among Republicans.
   However, even though Robertson has not formally withdrawn from
the race, his recent campaign efforts have been minimal.
   Speaking to the American Society of Newspaper Editors on Friday,
Robertson said ``it is obvious from the delegate count that has
come out that George Bush is going to be the nominee of the
Republican Party absent any unexpected eventuality.''
   Still, Robertson, who has 17 delegates, has not pulled out of
the race and said he still hopes to ``energize the people who
support me'' to take an active role in the convention.
   There has been no direct contact between Bush and Robertson,
even though the two were back-to-back speakers before the audience
of newspaper executives.
   ``I think he's plowed under,'' Bush said, speaking with
reporters on Air Force II last week as he returned from his swing
through New York.
   Asked if some prominent Republican, perhaps Dole, might serve as
a mediator between the two camps, Bush said: ``We don't need any
mediation. We need our facts clear.''
   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley said there was no intention on
Bush's part to try to persuade Robertson to throw in the towel in
the name of party unity.
   ``It would not be proper,'' Teeley said.
   However, the aide said, ``his campaign for the most part is
dormant. He's doing very little traveling. It's almost as if his
campaign is non-existent.''
   As for Reagan's participation, Teeley suggested it may be the
delegate count more than Robertson's persistence that is sidelining
the president. Teeley said that might change ``once we have the
delegates to go over the top.''
   According to The Associated Press delegate count, that will come
no later than May 3, probably even sooner.
   Meanwhile, Bush has clearly changed his campaign tactics. He's
focusing much more on the Democrats, and his campaign speeches have
become more assertive in their criticism.
   Claiming he can't distinguish much difference between Dukakis,
Gore and Jackson on most issues, Bush has accused all three of
seeking to take the United States back to ``the days of ships that
couldn't sail and planes that couldn't fly,'' of double-digit
inflation and interest rates.
   ``Do you want Americans to go back to those terrible days of
malaise and darkness?'' he asks audiences.
   On foreign policy, Bush accuses the Democrats of advocating
international policies that are ``dangerous, naive'' and filled
with ``wishful thinking.''
   Wherever Bush speaks, he is dogged by questions about his role
in the Iran-Contra affair and the legal difficulties surrounding
Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   On Iran-Contra, Bush sticks by his assertion that he knew
nothing about the arms-for-hostages operation until it had been
terminated. And, he adds, if he were a Democrat, he'd raise it as a
campaign issue too.
   ``The Democrats will be after it,'' is his stock answer,
``they've got little else to run on.''

<HEAD>Elderly Residents Sneak Back to High-Radiation Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 mostly elderly people evacuated from
their homes near Chernobyl have sneaked back to areas where
radiation levels are still above normal two years after the nuclear
disaster, Tass said Saturday.
   The official news agency said many never fully adjusted to
relocation after the April 26, 1986, nuclear reactor explosion. The
accident caused the death of at least 31 people and radiation
sickness in more than 200 others.
   About 135,000 people were evacuated from an 18-mile zone around
the plant. Two of 180 settlements evacuated have been declared safe
for rehabitation, but most evacuees are still housed in settlements
outside the danger zone.
   Tass quoted Alexei Demchenyuk, deputy head of the interior
department of the Kiev region, as saying people were returning to
their houses and farms by going around checkpoints. Tass did not
say to which settlements the people were returning.
   ``We do not have either a moral or legal right today to force
them to leave the zone,'' Demchenyuk told Tass. ``Militiamen not
only discharge their immediate functions to maintain public order,
but also help elderly people to cut firewood, repair houses and
deliver food.''
   Tass said there had been several cases of theft in abandoned
homes and public buildings over the two years.
   Demchenyuk said some people had tried to smuggle 17th and 18th
century icons out of the contaminated region.
   ``The radiation level of these cultural treasures exceeds
somewhat the permitted radiation standard. Therefore, the
scientists and restorers summoned to Chernobyl now work on how to
decontaminate and preserve them,'' Demchenyuk said.
   Chernobyl is about 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital of
Kiev.
   Tass said 21,000 houses and 1,500 apartments were built for the
evacuees in other parts of the Ukraine and that $1.5 billion in
compensation was given to the evacuee.
   Tass did not say how many militia patrols are assigned to the
area, but that they are responsible for ``keeping watch'' over the
radiation zone. Decontamination measures have reduced the radiation
level, Tass said, but it still is higher than normal.
   The report did not specify how high the radition level was.

Leaves</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Byrd Successor Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd's decision
to step down at the end of the year assures at the least a change
in style at the top of the Democratic Party.
   And it gave one retiring veteran of the Senate a moment to pause
and reflect on the changing style of leadership in what senators
like to call the world's oldest deliberative body.
   ``In the 30 years I have been here,'' said Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis., ``we have had the all-encompassing, dominating
leadership of Lyndon Johnson; the every-senator-is-a-leader,
consensus leadership of Mike Mansfield, the gentle,
behind-the-scenes masterful compromising leadership of Howard
Baker, the forceful and yet always considerate leadership of Bob
Dole, and the diligent, persistent, truly dedicated leadership of
Robert Byrd.''
   Mike Mansfield, who served 16 years as majority leader before
retiring in 1977, is now U.S. ambassador to Japan. Baker, a
Republican, is now White House chief of staff, while Dole, the
current Senate Republican leader, recently gave up his bid for the
GOP presidential nomination.
   Senate Democrats under Byrd of West Virginia, now meet weekly to
consider their agenda. But, Proxmire recalled, under Johnson, who
ran the Senate like a dictator from 1953 until 1961, ``we would
have a party caucus literally only once every two years, at the
beginning of the new Congress.
   ``Lyndon would deliver what we called Lyndon's `State of the
Union Message' and that was that. There was no need for a caucus
because Lyndon would decide everything, and I mean everything, the
Senate would act on.
   ``The Senate was a one-man show,'' said Proxmire, who is leaving
the Senate.
   The Wisconsin senator said that Byrd, who served as party
leader, and majority leader when Democrats controlled the Senate,
from 1977 through this year, was no dictator. But, Proxmire added,
Byrd has his convictions, too.
   ``Just yesterday, I called Senator Byrd to ask him to vote with
me on a matter of great importance to this senator. He flatly
refused. I entreated him. He replied, `No way!'''
   ``He said, `This is my position and that's that.' He would not
yield his convictions. I respect and admire him for that.''
   With Byrd looking on from his desk, Proxmire wound up by noting
``a little-observed side of our retiring majority leader.''
   He noted that the chaplain opens each day's Senate session with
a prayer.
   ``But often this body is treated to two prayers. We have the
chaplain's prayer, and then we have another prayer by the majority
leader, in effect. The majority leader often offers a truly
astonishing, spur-of-the-moment analysis of the chaplain's prayer.
   ``Senator Byrd will often be inspired to launch into a flight of
poetry, or a passage from some long-forgotten American or English
author. His recall is amazing. He can quote at length from the
Bible, from an infinite variety of speeches made by past political
leaders. He is able to recall word-for-word something he must have
read 10 or 20 years ago.
   ``Here is a unique leader, one who is, I think, too little
appreciated and one who has given this Senate and all senators a
very great deal.''

   Khalil al-Wazir, a baker's son who built
a guerrilla army from what began as a secret student cell, fought
the war against Israel for 35 years and was the heir-apparent of
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Al-Wazir, known throughout the Middle East by his nom-de-guerre
Abu Jihad (Father of the Holy War), was slain early Saturday at his
home in Tunis.
   He was known in the PLO as ``the Revolution's honest man.'' He
rarely wore a uniform, unlike Arafat, and listened more than he
spoke.
   Bodyguards called him the ``wailing wall'' and complained that
scores of people were allowed to visit him every day to tell their
troubles and seek his help.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization's military commander was
born in Ramle in what was Palestine on Oct. 10, 1935.
   In 1948, when he was 13, his family moved to Gaza after Israel
was created. He became leader of the students' union in high school
and formed a clandestine cell that challenged Egypt's rule over the
Gaza Strip.
   Egyptian authorities arrested al-Wazir in 1954 and held him for
several weeks. He led his first major guerrilla operation the next
year, blowing up water tanks near Beit Hanoun.
   During the 1956 Middle East war, al-Wazir went to Egypt and
enrolled in the Alexandria University law school.
   While in Egypt he met two other students, Yasser Arafat and
Salah Khalaf. They founded Fatah, an underground group dedicated to
regaining the land Palestinians lost to Israeli.
   Fatah, a reverse acronym in Arabic for the Palestine National
Liberation Movement, was to become the core of the Palestinian
movement.
   Arafat graduated with a civil engineering degree within a year
and got a job in Kuwait's Public Works Ministry. Al-Wazir dropped
out, went to Saudi Arabia seeking work and, in 1962, married his
cousin Intisar.
   Al-Wazir, Khalaf and Arafat reunited in Kuwait and began
recruiting for their movement. Al-Wazir moved to Algiers in 1963 to
found Asifa, Arabic for storm, and persuaded the Algerians to help
train about 100 young Palestinian fighters.
   He and Arafat went to China seeking help for Fatah. Arafat soon
returned to Kuwait but al-Wazir stayed in Asia for several months,
training in North Korea, China and North Vietnam.
   Returning to the Middle East, he established military
headquarters in Damascus, Syria.
   On Jan. 1, 1965, al-Wazir made a raid into Israel from Syria's
Golan Heights and claimed responsibility for Fatah. Because of
that, Jan. 1 has become ``Revolution Day'' for the 5 million
Palestinians.
   The Syrians arrested al-Wazir and several Fatah members in May
1966. He was freed after 45 days.
   Arafat shuttled among Arab capitals seeking political
recognition and financial support for Fatah. Al-Wazir recruited and
trained young Arab fighters and conducted more military operations
into Israel from Syria and Lebanon.
   In 1967, he led Asifa infiltrators into Israel's north. His men
fought the Jordanian army in 1970, when King Hussein drove the
guerrillas from Jordan.
   After the 1970 ``Black September'' fighting in Jordan, the PLO
set up headquarters in Lebanon. Three years later, al-Wazir was
named deputy commander of the PLO and led Palestinian units who
fought the Israelis in the 1973 Middle East war.
   Over the next nine years, he concentrated on guerrilla raids
into Israel, forming infiltration units and establishing
underground cells in the Iseraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982. The PLO left and al-Wazir
resumed his base in Damascus. Relations with the Syrians collapsed
in 1983 and al-Wazir moved to Tripoli in north Lebanon, but
Syrian-backed militiamen drove the PLO out of the city in December
1983.
   Al-Wazir retained the respect of dissident PLO elements and
Syrian leaders and made several futile attempts to reconcile Arafat
and President Hafez Assad of Syria, whose personal feud had
undermined the Syrian-PLO alliance.
   He moved to Jordan in 1984, but was expelled in July 1986 after
Hussein terminated an agreement with Arafat. He then moved to
Tunis, where the PLO now has its headquarters.
   Survivors are his widow, also known as Umm Jihad (Mother of the
Holy War); sons Jihad, 24; Bassem, 21, and Nidal, 2, and daughters,
Iman, 18, and Hanan 14.

   Iraq fired six long-range missiles into
Tehran and two other Iranian cities Saturday and Iran said it fired
two back. It was the heaviest missile barrage in the ``war of the
cities'' in 10 days.
   The U.S. Navy missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts limped into
Dubai in the southern Persian Gulf after it was holed by a mine
Thursday. Ten of the warship's 225-man crew were wounded in the
blast.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said the Iraqi missiles that hit Tehran crashed into
residential neighborhoods in the Iranian capital. It reported many
casualties, but gave no specific figures.
   It said missiles exploded in the central city of Isfahan,
Persia's 16th century capital, and the holy city of Qom, 100 miles
south of Tehran.
   IRNA said Iranian Revolutionary Guards fired two missiles at
``military centers'' in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, several hours
later. The official Iraqi News Agency said one missile hit the city
and killed an unspecified number of civilians in a residential
neighborhood.
   The two sides in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf war have fired
more than 300 missiles into each other's cities since Feb. 29.
   More than 120 missiles have hit the Iranian capital in that
period. Until the latest phase of the ``war of the cities,'' which
Iran and Iraq have waged intermittently since 1984, Tehran had
never been hit by missiles.
   The Iraqis also said their fighter-bombers raided the western
Iranian cities of Dezful and Hamadan. IRNA said four civilians were
killed.
   The Iranians reported 24 civilians were killed in Iraqi air
raids on nine Iranian cities Friday.
   IRNA said Iranian warplanes bombed ``military and economic
targets'' in four Iraqi towns, including Baqubeh, 30 miles
northeast of Baghdad, and the northern town of Dukan.
   It said other Iranian jets bombed Kut, 80 miles southeast of
Baghdad, and Zako and Erbil in the north.
   Shipping executives in Bahrain said a 10-mile stretch of the
central gulf has been declared a navigational hazard area because
of supected mines.
   The executives and Western diplomats, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they believe the Iranians laid the mine there that
holed the U.S. frigate.
   The mine was one of several spotted in the area and has
rekindled fears that the Iranians were again mining shipping lanes
in the strategic waterway after laying off for several months
following clashes with U.S. forces.
   Associated Press reporter Richard Pyle, aboard the USS
Wainwright in the gulf, reported that Navy divers Saturday
detonated two mines in the central gulf, near where the Roberts was
hit. Mine sweepers and helicopters searched for others.
   The Roberts was the first U.S. Navy ship damaged in the gulf
since an Iraqi warplane attacked the frigate Stark with missiles
May 17, 1987, killing 37 crewmen. The Iraqis said the pilot mistook
the Stark for an Iranian warship.
   The U.S. Navy, supported by warships from several western
European countries, increased its presence in the gulf last July to
protect reflagged Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attack.
   The Kuwait vessels were reregistered in the United States so
they could fly the U.S. flag. Iran accuses Kuwait of aiding Iraq's
war effort.

<HEAD>Serious Crime Reports Rise in 1987 for Third Straight Year</HEAD>

   The amount of serious crime reported to police
rose in 1987 for the third straight year and was up in all regions
of the country except the West, the FBI reported Saturday.
   Nationally, the 2 percent increase in 1987 followed rises of 5
percent in 1985 and 6 percent in 1986.
   The amount of violent crime reported to police in 1987 edged
down 1 percent, the FBI said, but the level of property crime was
up 2 percent.
   The FBI's crime index level was up 1 percent in the Midwest, 3
percent in the Northeast and 4 percent in the South. The West
experienced the only decline, moving downward 1 percent.
   Across the country, the number of reported aggravated assaults
rose 2 percent from 1987, while larcenies rose 3 percent and motor
vehicle thefts rose 5 percent, according to the preliminary
figures. Those three categories of offenses traditionally account
for about 70 percent of the major crime reported to the FBI by
police departments around the country.
   The number of murders reported to police fell by 4 percent last
year; forcible rapes dropped by 1 percent; robberies, by 5 percent;
burglaries, by 1 percent; and arsons, by 5 percent.
   It is difficult to determine whether the FBI crime data gathered
from police departments signifies an actual increase in crime
levels or if the rise is due to the fact that victims are simply
coming forward more frequently to report the offenses than they did
in the past.
   A survey last month by the Justice Department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics found that 37 percent of serious crimes were
reported to police agencies last year, compared with 32 percent
when the bureau's survey was first instituted in 1973.
   The bureau's survey of households, which measures crime that is
both reported and unreported to police, found that the amount of
crime in the United States last year remained stable.
   The FBI report and the bureau study both recorded declines in
crime levels during the first half of the decade. Many researchers
forecast an increase in crime in coming years as young people in
increasing numbers move into the most crime-prone age group of ages
15 to 24.

<HEAD>US Officials Still Wary Of Soviet Line On Anthrax Epidemic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A detailed explanation by Soviet officials of
a mysterious anthrax outbreak in 1979 has left U.S. experts divided
over longstanding allegations that the epidemic stemmed from an
accident related to
   biological warfare experiments.
   According to a lecture and slide show presented by Soviet health
officials over the last week in Washington, Baltimore and
Cambridge, Mass., the outbreak stemmed from a batch of contaminated
bone meal fed to livestock, whose meat, in turn, caused the deaths
of 66 people in Sverdlovsk, a city of 1.2 million in the Ural
Mountains.
   The long-awaited Soviet explanation ``leaves many questions
unanswered,'' said Gary B. Crocker, a State Department analyst
specializing in questions relating to Soviet military use of
biological and chemical weapons. ``It does not fit with the
evidence and facts we have collected on the issue,'' he said.
   The Carter administration had demanded a full accounting from
the Soviets in 1980, saying it had ``disturbing indications'' that
the epidemic was caused by ``some sort of lethal biological agent.''
   And in 1986, the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency released
a report alleging that the anthrax came from the Microbiology and
Virology Institute, a top-secret military research facility in
Sverdlovsk.
   The Pentagon report said ``a pressurized system probably
exploded'' at the institute, spewing as much as 22 pounds of
anthrax spores into the air, and that ``hundreds'' of Soviet
citizens died.
   Anthrax, an infectious disease which occurs naturally, is
considered a deadly candidate for use in biological weapons. A 1975
treaty signed by both superpowers bars possession of biological
weapons and significant quantities of biological agents, but allows
research ostensibly aimed at biowarfare defenses.
   James Oberg, author of the recent book ``Uncovering Soviet
Disasters,'' said he believes the Soviet health officials ``are
telling the truth'' in blaming the outbreak on a batch of
contaminated meat rather than germ-warfare experiments. ``But they
are not telling the whole truth,'' said Oberg.
   ``They should have said this eight or nine years ago,'' said
Oberg, who urged the Soviets to open the Sverdlovsk research
facility to Western observers. ``The damage has been done,'' he
said. ``It will take a lot more of this kind of disclosure to undo
the damage that Soviet paranoid secrecy has inflicted on
international relations.''
   The Soviets had long denied the U.S. allegations, but had
offered little evidence to refute them. The more detailed rebuttal
last week came from Dr. Pyotr N. Burgasov, former deputy Soviet
health minister, Dr. Vladimir N. Nikiforov, chief infectious
disease specialist at the Moscow Institute for the Advanced
Training of Physicians, and Dr. Vladimir P. Sergiyev, of the Soviet
health ministry.
   The heart of their argument, bolstered by gory autopsy slides,
was that the victims suffered severe damage to their intestines,
indicating they ate rather than inhaled the anthrax.
   But the DIA report said ``hundreds of Soviet citizens died from
inhalation of anthrax,'' and that others suffered after eating the
meat of animals who had inhaled the deadly spores.
   The Soviet officials declined to answer questions about the work
performed at the Sverdlovsk research lab. But, in circumstantial
refutation of the U.S. allegations, they said no one at the lab
became ill during the outbreak.
   Moreover, the Soviets denied that any military personnel were
involved in efforts to contain, control and clean up the epidemic,
a contention that contradicts U.S. intelligence reports that
soldiers were among the first victims and that military chemical
warfare teams may have been called in to fight the contamination.
   A number of American scientists who saw the presentation said
the Soviets made a good case. Dr. Philip Brachman, of Emory
University, called it a ``landmark report.''
   Dr. Alexander Langmuir, the former chief epidemiologist at the
National Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said he found the
Soviet version credible.
   And Harvard University biologist Matthew Meselson, who organized
the Soviet visit, was quoted by The Washington Post as saying he
found the Soviet explanation ``completely plausible and consistent
with what we know from the literature and other recorded
experiences with animal and human anthrax.''
   In the past, Meselson and Brachman have acted as consultants to
the government on alleged Soviet biological weapons. But government
officials said they remained skeptical and wanted to see a lengthy
published account that the Soviets first promised in 1986 but which
has not yet appeared.
   The Soviets still have not given a full accounting of the
episode to their own citizens, and some of the data offered to the
American audiences were at odds with past Soviet explanations.
   Nikiforov, a member of the visiting Soviet team, wrote in May
1980 that in March and April 1979 ``isolated cases of anthrax among
humans were recorded.''
   A Soviet Ministry of Health official, Nikolai Antonov, told a
world health conference in Switzerland in September 1986 that the
outbreak came after ``undisciplined workers'' threw contaminated
meat into garbage cans, and that stray dogs spread the meat to many
neighborhoods in Sverdlovsk.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Nicaragua's Sandinista
government and the Contra rebels started a second day of meetings
today in the capital in an effort to end the nation's 6-year-old
war.
   After a brief round of talks Friday night, the first ever in
Managua between the U.S.-supported rebels and Sandinista leaders,
the two groups met this morning for more extensive discussions.
   The meeting started at 9 a.m. (11 a.m. EDT) and was expected to
last for about 12 hours.
   Forty high-level Contra officials, some in Managua for the first
time since 1979, came ``in search of what (they) tried to attain
for many years ... democracy and liberty for the Nicaraguan
people,'' Adolfo Calero, head of the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance,
told a news conference.
   Earlier, he told reporters at Sandino International Airport that
the Contra leaders' presence in Managua ``is a triumph'' for their
cause.
   But Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, the Sandinistas' main
bargainer, said, ``The victory is when we reach a definitive
cease-fire. It doesn't involve mounting a publicity show, but of
complying'' with a preliminary peace plan signed March 23.
   The talks mark the first time since the war began that the
Sandinistas have allowed rebel leaders to openly come to Managua.
   They are designed to move the two sides closer to halting the
fighting that has claimed more than 26,000 lives since it began in
November 1981, according to the government.
   Agreement on details of the truce was reached during talks that
concluded Friday in the southern border post of Sapoa, 90 miles
from Managua.
   The two sides in those talks issued a statement that said
``considerable progress'' had been made in narrowing their
differences and that additional discussions would be held.
   The talks were called for in the preliminary peace plan. As part
of that agreement, a 60-day cease-fire went into effect on April 1
to give both sides time to work out a lasting peace.
   But the two sides were unable to agree on important issues such
as verification that the Contra fighters have moved into seven
designated cease-fire zones, how the rebels would be resupplied,
and if they should be allowed to keep their weapons.
   ``We will try to seek mechanisms in order to guarantee physical
and moral security for our combatants,'' said Azucena Ferry, a
member of the rebel directorate.
   Under the agreement, the Contras were supposed to have gathered
in the zones by Friday, but there was no indication that occurred.
   The Sandinistas, in return, were to have released 700 political
prisoners, allowed humanitarian aid for the rebels and permitted
the insurgents to send representatives to take part in internal
political discussions.
   The Contra leaders arrived more than four hours late on a
commercial flight from San Jose, Costa Rica, and relatives gathered
at the airport to greet them.
   Violetta Chamorro, the co-owner of the opposition newspaper La
Prensa, waited to see her son, Contra leader Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro, returning to Managua for the first time since 1986.
   Earlier, her newspaper's building was the target of a protest by
about 300 teen-agers who pelted the building with rocks to protest
the publication's pro-rebel stand.
   The demonstrators said they belonged to a group called
Sandinista Youth. Witnesses who insisted on anonymity said a young
man was slightly injured by a pail thrown from the roof.
   The Interior Ministry immediately banned all demonstrations and
alcohol sales around the airport and hotel where the Contras were
staying and closed the main road to the airport.
   Contra leaders claim they have about 10,000 rebels under arms.
The Sandinistas claim they have an armed force of 300,000 men and
women, including an 80,000-man army.
   The cease-fire was called for under a Central American peace
plan signed by five Central American presidents last August.

   With the fall of television evangelists
Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker, many disillusioned believers are
attempting to turn their backs on their fundamentalist faiths, says
the founder of Fundamentalists Anonymous.
   ``People leaving the Moonies actually get more support because
people say, `Oh my God, you used to be one of them,''' said Jim
Luce, referring to followers of the Korean cult leader Sun Myung
Moon.
   About 50,000 people have contacted the support group for help
since Luce and Richard Yao, a fellow Wall Street executive, ran a
two-line ad in New York's Village Voice newspaper three years ago
suggesting a self-help group for former fundamentalists, Luce said.
   ``The concept that fundamentalism can go so far overboard that
people can be hurt is being readily accepted,'' said Luce in a
telephone interview from his office in New York.
   ``We define fundamentalism as a mind-set that sees the world in
black and white, right and wrong, good and evil. A mind-set that is
very authoritarian, intolerant and compulsive about imposing its
beliefs on others,'' he said.
   Those seeking help from the group have included Catholics,
Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons and even ``a couple of Japanese
Buddhist fundamentalists,'' Luce said.
   ``We're not saying that all fundamentalists have this problem.
But if you take your religious beliefs to the extreme to the point
where you become dysfunctional, then obviously you have a
problem,'' he said.
   People trying to leave a fundamentalist faith often feel cut off
from life, since they typically have been attending several church
functions a week and spending most of their weekends in religious
activities, Luce said. Those who leave often are shunned by friends
and family, he said.
   ``These people have no social skills outside of
fundamentalism,'' he said. ``Fundamentalism has its own rules, its
own social system. So when you leave, you're trying to make it in a
system where idle chatter could be about movies or books. These
people don't have any of that social context.''
   Low self-esteem is another problem for many trying to break with
their past, Luce said.
   ``You're told within the fold that you're nothing but a worm.
Women are worse than that. And, of course, you are told that if you
leave the fold, you are an evil person, you are a bad person, a
damned person.''
   The group has developed a five-step self-help program based on
the Alcoholics Anonymous program. People meet in support groups but
can keep their identities secret.
   The group has been criticized by fundamentalist organizations
and is ``No. 1 on Jerry Falwell's hit list,'' said Luce. But Mark
DeMoss, a spokesman for the Lynchburg, Va.-based evangelist, said
Falwell was ``basically unconcerned'' about Luce's group.
   ``They appear to be about a two-man organization operating out
of a church with a telephone number and a post office box number,''
DeMoss said in a telephone interview. ``It doesn't appear to be
that big of a deal.''
   A spokesman for Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries in Baton Rouge
declined comment on Fundamentalists Anonymous.
   ``Reverend Swaggart has specifically asked me not to respond to
any criticisms,'' said spokesman Gus Weill.
   Swaggart recently was defrocked by the Assemblies of God after
he refused a one-year suspension from the pulpit over his
confession of moral failure. A prostitute said Swaggart paid her to
pose nude for him.
   In addition to individual support efforts, the group has been
involved in legal efforts by PTL ``lifetime partners'' to recover
their contributions following Bakker's departure from the ministry
over a sex scandal.
   Luce, 28, who gave up a career as a bank manager to devote all
his time to Fundamentalists Anonymous, said Swaggart was one of the
earliest examples he used of the dangers of fundamentalism. Since
Swaggart's scandal, calls to the group have increased dramatically,
he said.
   Luce, who described himself as an American Baptist, said he was
first exposed to fundamentalism when members of his family became
involved in the Pentecostal faith.
   ``It caused serious damage when they would tell other members of
the family that they weren't Christian, they were going to hell,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem gunmen holding about 35
hostages aboard a hijacked Kuwaiti jet said today they want the
plane refueled so that a massacre could be avoided in Algeria.
   One masked gunman, addressing three reporters at the top of the
gangway leading to the plane, said the hijackers ``are now working
to blow up this plane'' if 17 terrorists jailed in Kuwait are not
freed.
   ``We are determined to obtain the liberation of our 17 brothers.
In view of the Kuwaiti intransigence, we are asking our Algerian
brothers to refuel the plane so that we can take off because we
intend to settle our score with Kuwait somewhere else.
   ``We do not want the massacre to take place here in friendly
Algeria, which welcomed us and which tried to settle the problem.''
   He said, however, that they were not abandoning the negotiating
process and remained willing to examine ``every proposal.''
   The hijackers have killed two hostages during the 12 day ordeal.
   Three hijackers, all wearing light blue hoods and one of them
carrying a machine gun, were seen by the journalists, representing
The New York Times, the French news agency Agence France-Presse and
the Algerian government agency Algerie Presse Service.
   The statement was read in Arabic by one of the three who were
standing in the plane's doorway. Nothing was visible inside the
plane.
   The reporters were frisked at the bottom of the gangway by the
man who read the statement.
   They were each allowed to ask two questions after the statement
was read, and the entire episode lasted about 15 minutes.
   One asked if it was possible to envisage a solution whereby the
hostages would be freed in Algeria and the hijackers would leave.
   The reply was: ``A solution will be proposed to us and we will
examine it together with our Algerian brothers in a comprehensive
manner. We must have a comprehensive solution.''
   The response appeared to soften the tone of other remarks,
indicating that the crisis could still be solved in Algeria.
   Negotiations, which began today at 10:40 a.m., were expected to
continue.
   The Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 was hijacked April 5 with 112
people aboard on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait. Fifty-seven
passengers were released in Mashhad, Iran. The hijackers killed two
hostages in Larnaca, Cyprus, and released 13 before flying to the
Algerian capital on Wednesday.
   The hijackers are demanding that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranian
extremists convicted of bombing the U.S. and French embassies in
Kuwait in 1983. Kuwait has refused.
   On Friday, Algerian mediators shuttled between Kuwaiti officials
and the plane, entering to talk with hijackers at least five times.
Two of the hostages pleaded for their lives via radio in an appeal
to the Kuwaiti government to give in to the hijackers' demand.
   ``In the name of God the merciful, I greet my family and my
friends and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the 17 prisoners
held in Kuwaiti prisons,'' one hostage, Soleiman Mohammed Soleiman
al-Mashari, in a message to the control tower Friday. ``In the
event of refusal, they are going to kill us.''
   Reagan administration and Western intelligence sources said they
believe one of the eight hijackers is Hasan Ezzidine, a Lebanese
national under U.S. indictment for the June 1985 hijacking of the
TWA airliner.
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States is seeking Ezzidine's extradition. The sources said
without elaboration that a coded radio message from Beirut to the
aircraft mentioned the name Ezzidine.
   Ezzidine may have been directly involved in the killing of
Robert Dean Stethem, a Navy diver beaten and shot to death during
the TWA hijacking, today's New York Times quoted administration
officials as saying.
   The intelligence sources say they believe the seizure of the
Kuwaiti plane was masterminded by Imad Mughniyeh, another of the
four Lebanese Shiite militants indicted by U.S. authorities for the
TWA hijacking.
   They said Mughniyeh, 36, dropped out of sight in Beirut several
weeks ago after returning from Iran. Mughniyeh is a security chief
for the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Lebanese Shiite
fundamentalist faction.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella organization for
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups holding 22 foreign hostages,
including nine Americans, in Lebanon.
   Some freed passengers said the gunmen were joined by another man
after the plane was forced to land in Iran.
   Algeria denied it had guaranteed that hostages aboard the
aircraft would be freed when the plane reached Algiers, reinforcing
a sense of stalemate in negotiations as the crisis entered its 12th
day.
   ``Algeria agreed to welcome the plane at the express demand of
the Kuwaiti government and with a strictly humanitarian goal,'' a
government statement said Friday.
   Cyprus government spokesman Akis Fantis had said his government
received assurances from unspecified ``sources in Algiers'' that
the hostages and the plane would be released.
   Among the hostages are three members of Kuwait's large Al-Sabah
royal family and at least four crew members.

   Saadi Qattaineh was dozing in his seat, high above
the Indian Ocean, when a clamor woke him.
   ``There were two men shouting `Hands up!''' he said. ``One
grabbed the steward and the other started checking him for guns.''
   One of the longest air hijackings had begun. It lasted nine days
for Qattaineh and was in its 12th day Saturday for about 35
hostages still held on the Boeing 747 that left Bangkok as Kuwaiti
Airlines Flight 422 and made its way in stages to Algiers.
   Qattaineh and other freed hostages described the hijack, which
began before dawn April 5, in interviews with The Associated Press.
   They said the gunmen quickly donned makeshift hoods cut from
airline pillowcases and began herding their hostages to a central
section of the jumbo jet.
   ``As soon as they hijacked the aircraft they told us, `We have
certain demands of the Kuwaiti government. ... Just remain calm,'''
Qattaineh said. The hijackers demand the release of 17 pro-Iranian
extremists convicted of bombing the U.S. and French Embassies in
Kuwait in December 1983.
   The plane veered north to Iran and landed at the airport in
Mashhad.
   Because the gunmen ordered the window blinds kept closed, the
passengers did not know where they were, Qattaineh said. The first
inkling came when they were served bread and cheese for breakfast
and ``the napkins said Iran Air.''
   Qattaineh, a 61-year-old retired fireman with a Jordanian
passport, said the hijackers placed the passengers two to a row,
separated by several seats.
   At least two gunmen watched the hostages at all times,
forbidding them to talk and ordering them to shift seats every few
hours, he said.
   Passengers were taken individually for questioning to a forward
cabin beyond a curtain. Some said pillowcase hoods were slipped
over their heads.
   ``We were asked about our religion and how many children we had,
and our work,'' said Saleh Ibrahim Malik, a Kuwaiti.
   Ramadan Ali, an Egyptian-American engineer, said hijackers asked
whether he was a Sunni Moslem or Shiite.
   The hijackers are believewd to be Shiites. All Kuwaitis released
in the first 11 days of the hijacking are Shiites, the predominant
faction in Iran and south Lebanon.
   Ali said the gunmen took the briefcase in which he had hidden
his American passport and stowed it with other luggage in a baggage
compartment.
   Hijackers confiscated passports _ Ali gave them his Egyptian
documents _ and while inspecting wallets overlooking Ali's American
driving license.
   In Iran, Moslem passengers stood several times to pray in the
traditional Islamic manner, but Ali said it made the hijackers
nervous and ``They said, `Hey guys, if you want to pray, pray in
your seats.'''
   On the ground in Iran, the gunmen produced plastic handcuffs
after two days and put them on the hostages, the freed passengers
said.
   Some former hostages said the handcuffs were left on until their
release, but others said they were removed occasionally.
   After three days in Iran the plane flew to Cyprus, where it was
permitted to land at Larnaca because it was low on fuel. It
remained there five days.
   Passengers said they were unaware of the gunmen's threats to
blow up the plane unless their demands were met.
   Most agreed that small machine guns appeared after the plane
left Iran, along with more hand grenades and ropes that were tied
to the doors. Some said they saw explosives attached to the ropes.
   Several passengers also said one or two new gunmen appeared
during the stop in Iran and Ali said they seemed to take charge of
the ``six or seven'' young men who had seized the plane.
   Identification was difficult because the hijackers ``kept
changing their voices and the way they were dressed,'' Qattaineh
said.
   In Cyprus, the hijackers beat and shot two young Kuwaitis to
death, throwing the bodies from the plane.
   None said they knew of the slayings, which occurred out of their
view, but several former hostages said there were ominous signs.
   Mohammed Kamel Sayyid Rehan of Cairo said the gunmen told them:
``We either all die together or live together.''
   ``Before they let us go, two hijackers appeared wearing napkins
round their necks on which they had written `Martyrdom is our
Love','' he said.
   Passengers said they were forced to wear handcuffs even to the
restroom.
   ``I was hit on the face once when I locked the door to the
toilet,'' Rehan said, but he and the others said blows were
infrequent.
   With their hands bound, forced to remain in their seats, there
was little to do but read the only book most had at hand, Islam's
holy Koran.
   ``I feel as if I've been born again,'' said Sharif Mamdouh
Badrawi. ``I read the entire Koran on the plane.''

<HEAD>Philippine Troops Raid Hideout of Fugitive Rebel Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>

   Troops raided a hideout of the
fugitive leader of August's attempted coup and scoured other
neighborhoods for rebels, the military said Saturday.
   The nation's armed forces remained on full alert to block any
coup attempt while President Corazon Aquino was on a four-day trip
to China and Hong Kong. She was to return Sunday.
   The raiders did not find former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan in the hideout, an automobile repair shop in suburban
Quezon City. But they seized his motorcycle and military uniforms,
the officials said.
   The raid came late Friday after troops captured 10 of his
followers in a nearby house.
   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said they included
eight of 14 navy guards who helped him escape his prison ship April
2. He had been held there since his December arrest for the failed
coup on Aug. 28 that left 53 dead and 300 hurt.
   The military said the 10 arrests foiled a plot to attack the
presidential palace.
   A report to Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos said government
forces were still looking for rebels. It gave no details, and Ramos
told reporters only that the operations were being carried out in
undisclosed neighborhoods.
   Before flying to Hong Kong Saturday, Mrs. Aquino told reporters
in Beijing she was ``very happy'' about the capture of the 10
Honasan followers.
   The military believed Honasan used a small room in the auto shop
as his sleeping quarters, the government's television station
reported Saturday. It said the raiders also found a device used to
reload 45-caliber bullets, a dictionary, a bible and canned food
inside the room.
   Col. Emilio Templo, commander of the 300-member squad making the
arrests, said the plotters planned to approach the palace by rubber
boats down a tributary of the PasigRiver, which flows behind the
building in the heart of the capital.
   But the military was tipped off about the plot, ``so we acted
quickly,'' Templo said. ``We preempted the plan.''
   Honasan was a key figure in the civilian-backed military revolt
that ousted former President Ferdinand Marcos and swept Mrs. Aquino
to power on Feb. 25, 1986.
   But Honasan became disenchanted with Mrs. Aquino and led the
August coup attempt, the most serious of six bids to unseat Mrs.
Aquino since she became president.
   A military statement said officials were questioning the
arrested navy soldiers and some had admitted receiving bribes from
Honasan to help him escape. One told investigators that married men
in the group were given $100 and bachelors received $65 each, the
statement said.
   Officials said the group offered no resistance although they
were found in possession of 16 M-14 rifles, four M-16s, one light
machine gun, five Israeli-made Uzi machine guns and a grenade.
   They told authorities they didn't know where Honasan was hiding,
according to the military statement.

   President Reagan, under pressure from Congress
to ``take off the gloves'' in fighting foreign drug trafficking,
said Saturday his administration has waged an unprecedented
campaign against the flow of drugs from abroad.
   The president, who has threatened to veto Senate-passed
legislation calling for sanctions against Mexico over drug
trafficking, devoted his weekly radio address from Camp David, Md.,
to the drug issue.
   ``In addition to prevention, education and drug law enforcement,
we have also been emphasizing the international side of the
problem,'' Reagan said.
   ``When we came into office, there were drug eradication programs
under way in only two countries,'' he said. ``Today, that number is
23.
   ``In fact, this country has signed an unprecedented number of
mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties and
eradication agreements.''
   The Senate voted 63-27 on Thursday to overturn a finding made by
the president six weeks ago that Mexico was ``fully cooperating''
with the United States in the war on drugs.
   If passed by the House and signed into law, the measure could
deprive Mexico of some of its trade benefits and would require U.S.
representatives in international lending institutions to vote
against Mexican loan applications.
   During debate on the measure, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-N.M.,
said nearly 40 percent of the cocaine entering the United States
comes across the 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexican border.
   ``We've got to take off the gloves,'' DeConcini said.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has approved similar
legislation regarding the Bahamas.
   ``The president has threatened to veto both of those bills,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday.
   ``We think those are two good examples of counterproductive
actions where congressmen have obvious frustrations and they've
taken them out in this area, but it's not helpful in the drug fight
or in our broader relations with these countries,'' Fitzwater said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said approval of the
bill might lead to an increase in drug traffic because, ``Far from
serving as a catalyst for action, this vote castigates a friend for
less than perfect behavior.''
   Redman said the Senate resolution failed to recognize Mexico's
substantial anti-drug efforts and the ``extremely positive
response'' of Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid to Reagan's
call for increased cooperation.

   Samuel Howard lived a hard life, but the
money he saved while he was in prison on his third of three murder
convictions has been set aside to provide a brighter future for
other inmates.
   The University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa has established what is
believed to be the nation's first college scholarship for
prisoners, the $10,000 Samuel Howard Endowed Scholarship Fund.
   Of the $10,000, about $6,000 came from Social Security checks
that Howard, who died in 1986, had deposited in a bank in Dothan.
The joint bank account was set up by Howard and Jim Loftin, a
former employer who had befriended him, before Howard went to
prison for the third killing.
   Loftin and his wife, Marian, provided the rest of the money for
the fund.
   ``We wanted to put the money in something that would help other
people,'' she said in an interview last week. ``We felt that as
hard a time as he had in his life, there were people who helped him
in prison. It meant a lot to him. We wanted to do something in his
memory.''
   Howard ``didn't care about the money,'' Loftin said. ``He would
have loved to have a scholarship in his name.''
   Howard worked for the Loftins for five years, doing yard work
and helping in the warehouse at Loftin's moving and storage
business.
   State prison system records show Howard was convicted of two
counts of first-degree murder and one of assault with intent to
murder and was sentenced to two life terms plus 20 years in prison
in January 1952. He was paroled in 1961.
   Then, in 1975, he was sentenced to 40 years on a second-degree
murder conviction, said a prison spokeswoman. The records
immediately at hand gave few details of the crimes, she said.
   Howard died in the state prison's facility for aged and infirm
prisoners on July 20, 1986. Following his death, the Loftins
started exploring the idea of a scholarship in his memory.
   ``We couldn't find any university that had done that, and it was
difficult to work out the details because there was nothing like it
to go on. It was an idea that just happened,'' said Mrs. Loftin,
who is director of the university's regional office at Dothan.
   A university committee will administer the scholarship and
select recipients from among the prisoners who apply, starting next
January. ``It is not set up according to age, sex, race or
anything,'' Mrs. Loftin said. ``Anyone can apply.'' The state
prison system has more than 12,000 inmates.
   The university's College of Continuing Studies will help inmates
who want to take independent courses.
   ``Reports on illiteracy say people who have some kind of
educational development while in prison are less likely to be put
back in incarceration,'' Mrs. Loftin said.
   Despite his murder convictions, Howard ``was a very friendly
person,'' she said. ``He was uneducated but was very interested in
people. Our kids liked him and he liked them. It was a friendship.''
   The Loftin family occasionally visited Howard in prison and
often sent him items that he needed. ``He didn't have anybody that
we knew of, so we just kept in communication with him,'' said Mrs.
Loftin.
   ``We kept hoping that one day he would get a pardon,'' Mrs.
Loftin said. ``He told us, `If you need any money, you just take
it.' But we never did.''

<HEAD>Gore Says He Needs Strong Finish In New York To Remain Viable</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic candidate Albert Gore Jr., who
is trailing badly in voter preference polling for Tuesday's New
York primary, reiterated Saturday he had to pick up more support in
order to remain a viable candidate.
   ``At a minimum we have to have a strong finish to demonstrate
continued momentum,'' Gore said as he toured a market in the heart
of Buffalo's Polish community. ``But I'm not going to put specific
numbers on it.''
   In a poll released Friday by a Buffalo-based public research
firm, Goldhaber Associates, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
holds a comfortable lead among the Democrats with 43 percent, Jesse
Jackson was second with 28 percent and Gore had 8 percent.
   Twenty percent of the 367 Democrats surveyed by telephone on
Thursday and Friday said they were unsure whom they would vote for
in the primary. The poll had a margin of error of 5 percent.
   On Friday, Gore dismissed the figures, saying, ``The polls have
been consistently wrong about me.''
   He said there was time for him to improve his standing and that
several recent endorsements from state and local officials were
encouraging. New York City Mayor Ed Koch endorsed Gore on Thursday
and state Assembly Majority Leader James Tallon endorsed him
Friday. Gore picked up the endorsements of a city councilman and
state senator on Saturday.
   Many voters have not yet decided on the candidates and those who
have expressed a preference might still change their mind, he said.
As a result, support for the front-runners may not be as strong as
people think, he said.
   On another issue, Gore disagreed with party leaders, such as
Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk and New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, who think the nomination should go to the candidate
with a plurality of votes.
   ``The rules provide that the candidate who has the majority of
the delegates becomes the nominee,'' Gore said. ``One or two people
can't change the rules of the Democratic Party. It has to be done
according to due process and that hasn't taken place.''

<HEAD>Grisly Murders Spark Move Talk Among Neighbors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police say the grisly killing of four
teen-agers was an isolated incident in an otherwise relatively
quiet area, but some residents say theirs is a neighborhood where
``crime is like eating and changing dresses _ an everyday thing.''
   At least two residents say they heard the victims' screams in
the middle of the night, but the only call police got was from one
of the victims.
   Mary Mireles says it's time to pack up and leave after 12 years.
   ``My daughter just bought a place in the country. There are some
empty lots there. I told my husband maybe we have been here too
long. I liked it here because it was quiet at one time,'' she said
in her yard across the street from the mobile home where the
killings took place Friday.
   The victims, stabbed with steak knives, were identified as
Jennifer Mann, 19; Shannon Mann, 17; Martha Mann, 14; and their
brother, Ernest Mann, 13.
   Leo Narvaiz, 20, a former boyfriend of Shannon Mann, was
arrested late Friday and charged with four counts of capital
murder. Narvaiz had a stab wound in the thigh and a cut on his
hand, and was being held in Medical Center Hospital in lieu of
$4.05 million bond, police said.
   ``I heard a lot of screams,'' Mrs. Mireles said. ``They were
screaming `Help,' and they were crying and screaming and I told my
husband and he said, `No, let's not get involved.'''
   ``He thought they would shoot at anybody who went out to see
what was going on,'' she said.
   ``We heard yelling and the sound of someone climbing over the
chain-link fence,'' said Virginia Ytuarte, who lives half a block
away. ``The next thing we know, the cops are at the door, telling
us that something ugly happened next door, that blood was
everywhere like the Charles Manson murders.''
   Police received word of the stabbings when a girl called the 911
emergency number and said ```One of my sister's boyfriends is
beating us up and has killed my sister,''' said homicide
investigator Lt. Albert Ortiz.
   ``The only call that came through was the one where the Mann
girl was calling us,'' police Sgt. Mike Akeroyd said Saturday.
   Mrs. Mireles, 58, said it was only the latest incident at the
Villa Grande Mobile Home Park.
   ``It's terrible. We cannot help but see the people robbing one
another and jumping the fence. But we're afraid to speak out,'' she
said.
   ``This is like eating and changing dresses _ an everyday
thing,'' she said.
   Down the street, Mary Hartman said she was not scared by the
slayings, but also figures it might be time to move away.
   ``It was very quiet,'' she said of the neighborhood she moved to
10 years ago. ``But years progress and things change. This whole
neighborhood has been robbed already.''
   Like most of the residents in the neighborhood, the Hartmans
have bars on their doors and windows.
   But Barry Byers, supervisor at the mobile home park, said crime
is not a problem there. He said the park has a full patrol system
operated by a private security company that keeps an eye on the 10
acres.
   ``This could happen anywhere,'' he said of the murders.
   Although the southside of San Antonio is known as a high-crime
area, an officer in the night magistrate's court said the mobile
home park actually is located between two of the worst crime areas.
   ``It is kind of open in that particular area,'' said Robert
Grego, the court officer. ``There's an area farther west and some
farther south that are a littler rougher. This is on the fringes of
both.''
   Grego said he believed the case was an isolated incident and one
of the first violent crimes for the area. ``It's no more dangerous
than any place out there.''
   Mrs. Ytuarte moved into a mobile home half a block from the
murder scene eight months ago because it looked like a serene place
for her, her husband and their two small children.
   ``I liked it here. It looked so peaceful,'' she said. ``I never
figured anything like this would happen.
   ``I'm scared. Trailers are so easy to get into, now that I think
about it.''

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers today
killed 13 Palestinians, Arab and hospital reports said, in the
bloodiest day in four months of violence as riots erupted to
protest the assassination of a PLO leader.
   Up to 90 other Palestinians were wounded in the riots, according
to hospitals, U.N. officials and Arab journalists. Curfews were
slapped on 10 refugee camps.
   At least six Arabs killed in Gaza by army gunfire were from
refugee camps. A Palestinian from the village of Abasan, near Gaza
City, also died in a clash with soldiers.
   Reports said three of the dead were from the Jenin refugee camp
in the West Bank. It was not immediately clear where the others
deaths occurred.
   The victims ranged in age from 17 to 45.
   The army command, which is normally slow to confirm casualties,
said four Palestinians were killed, all in the Gaza Strip. It said
it did not have figures on the number of wounded.
   Violence broke out early in the morning in Gaza, where Khalil
al-Wazir, the assassinated PLO leader, lived at one time and had
relatives.
   Al-Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, was the No. 2 official in
Yasser Arafat's Fatah group. He was killed today by a commando unit
of seven men and one woman in a suburban home near Tunis, Tunisia.
   Black flags of mourning flew across the West Bank and throughout
towns in the Gaza Strip.
   At a memorial service for al-Wazir held by family members, a
confrontation developed between Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas
and Palestinian youths, who raised the outlawed PLO flag and threw
stones.
   Women carrying black flags gathered on the roof, shouting
``Allahu Akbar,'' God is Great.
   Several shots were heard, and the group dispersed with no
injuries immediately evident.
   Reporters saw makeshift roadblocks and burning tires on nearly
every street in Gaza City. Palestinian youths, their faces masked
by kaffiyeh headdresses or shirts, stopped motorists and questioned
them.
   The fatalities, if confirmed, would equal the highest single-day
death toll since the uprising began Dec. 8.
   U.N. spokesman Bill Lee said 149 Palestinians had been killed in
riots not including today's clashes. Of those, 124 have died from
army gunfire. One Israeli soldier has been killed.
   Ariel Merari, a leading terrorism expert at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center For Strategic Studies, predicted
al-Wazir's assassination would have a divisive effect on the
Palestinians.
   ``It is a blow to the morale of the Palestinians in the occupied
territories, but it could also arouse feelings of revenge,'' said
Merari.
   He said there was a strong possibility the assassination early
today was an outgrowth of a power struggle between al-Wazir and
Arafat over the appointment of commanders in southern Lebanon,
where the PLO was rebuilding its guerrilla force.
   But Merari also noted that al-Wazir had headed the PLO appartaus
that carried out thousands of military operations against Israel
since it seized the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Bassam Shakaa, the deposed mayor of Nablus in the West Bank,
blamed Israel for al-Wazir's assassination.
   ``No one else can benefit from his killing, only Israel and the
Zionists,'' said Shakaa, a hardline Palestinian leader whose legs
were blown off in a booby-trap car bomb attack by the Jewish
Underground.
   Ahmed al-Wazir, cousin and brother-in-law of the slain PLO
leader, held a memorial service in Gaza City that was attended by
thousands of Palestinians.
   ``All I can say is that Abu Jihad had been carrying his coffin
in his own hands for the past 30 years,'' al-Wazir said.
   Al-Wazir was born in the city of Ramle, now in Israel, and moved
to the Gaza Strip in 1948.
   Elias Freij, the mayor of the West Bank town of Bethlehem,
condemned the killing of Abu Jihad but said it was ``not easy to
point a finger at anyone'' until more was known.
   But he predicted the killing would have ``grave consequences.''
   Rashad Al Shawaa, the deposed mayor of Gaza City, said most
Palestinians were blaming Israel for the attack: ``I don't think
his death is going to stop the PLO from continuing its struggle.
Perhaps his death will create more support.''
   On Friday, hundreds of Jewish settlers defiantly marched in West
Bank hills and named a highway junction for a 15-year-old Israeli
girl who was killed along with two Palestinians in a clash in an
Arab village.
   Israeli soldiers surrounded mosques in the West Bank cities of
Hebron and Qalqilya and clamped a curfew on Khan Yunis in the Gaza
Strip to prevent violent protests after Moslem prayers.

<HEAD>Woman Finds $1,000 in Envelope; Saves Georgia Woman's Vacation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At first, Alice Lisquez thought the
$100 bill she pulled from an envelope was play money, and in a way
it was.
   A Georgia woman had sent in an order to Michigan Bulb Co. and
mistakenly enclosed 10 hundred-dollar bills that she had been
saving for her vacation.
   ``It never occurred to me to take it,'' Lisquez said.
   Lisquez, 47, found the big bucks about three weeks ago, tucked
into a $21.84 order for creeping phlox and peonies sent to the
company from Mary Duval of Dahlonega, Ga.
   Lisquez told her supervisor, Sue Barnstable, about her
discovery. Barnstable tracked down Duval and sent her a $1,000
check to her to replace the cash.
   On Thursday, Lisquez received a $100 bill and a silk scarf from
Duval as a reward. ``Lord, it's the least I could do,'' Duval said
Saturday.
   Duval, 63, a nurse, said the return of the money has saved a
month-long trip to England she has planned for later this year.
It'll be her first trip there.
   ``Dear Alice,'' Duval wrote in a letter enclosed with the scarf.
``I called your office to obtain your name and to thank you. I,
like you, am a working girl and I had saved most of (the money)
haphazardly and converted it to the $100 bills, as a twenty gets
easily spent.
   ``It was for a badly needed vacation, and thanks to you my plans
do not have to be changed.''
   A second note to Barnstable praised Lisquez for her honesty.
   ``I still have difficulty accepting the fact that there is basic
honesty practiced,'' Duval wrote. ``I would never have known what
happened to the money.''
   Office Manager Lyle Hansen said he has seen a few mistaken
mailings over the company's 43-year history, but never more than a
phone bill or house payment that got switched around in the
shuffle, and never before in cash.

   A commando unit of seven men and one woman
burst into a suburban home early today and opened fire with machine
guns, killing the PLO's military chief and three bodyguards.
   Khalil al-Wazir, caught reading PLO reports in his study, fired
his pistol once but was sprayed with about 170 bullets, said
officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis.
   Abdallah Frangi, the PLO representative in Bonn, West Germany,
blamed Israeli security agents for the attack.
   ``Eight members of the Israeli secret service, armed with
machine pistols equipped with silencers, forced their way into the
house and shot the bodyguards of Abu Jihad,'' said Frangi, using
al-Wazir's alias.
   ``The Israelis have proven with this bloodbath that they have a
secret service which is capable of every kind of murder. They have
also shown that they do not want peace with the Palestinians,'' he
said.
   PLO sources in Tunis and elsewhere said a second commando unit
was waiting outside while al-Wazir was killed. One PLO source in
Nicosia said ``a busload of people, we think 30 altogether'' was
involved in the operation.
   It was not immediately clear how the commandos escaped.
   Al-Wazir led the Palestinian armed forces, acting as deputy
military commander behind Yasser Arafat. He was a member of the PLO
executive committee and No. 2 man in Fatah, the largest branch of
the PLO.
   An Arab diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
al-Wazir ``was the prime mover behind the uprising against Israel
in the West Bank and Gaza.''
   Al-Wazir was among PLO leaders closest to Arafat and was widely
regarded as among the most moderate. A soft-spoken man, al-Wazir
was obeyed even by dissident officers who split from Fatah after
feuding with co-founder Arafat.
   Al-Wazir was the first of the three co-founders of Fatah to be
killed.
   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Aviv Shir-on, said
he had no information on al-Wazir's killing. Other Israeli
officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the
Jewish Sabbath.
   A three-day general strike and mourning was declared by
Palestinian activists in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where riots broke out.
   Arab reports said more than 12 Palestinians were killed today in
the bloodiest day since anti-occupation riots began on Dec. 8.
   Al-Wazir, 52, was killed about 1:15 a.m. (8:15 p.m. EDT) by
commandos who drove up to his house in Sidi Abu Saeed, fatally shot
a Tunisian bodyguard driver and burst inside, where they killed
al-Wazir's two Palestinian bodyguards, the PLO spokesman said.
   ``They then broke into Abu Jihad's study. Everything happened
within seconds,'' he said.
   Al-Wazir's wife Imjihad, daughter Hannan, 14, and son Nidal, 2,
were in the house, but were not hurt, PLO officials said.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat was stunned by the assassination of
his military commander but held meetings with Bahraini leaders
today, aides reported in Manama.
   Arafat was in Bahrain to map stategy for the occupied
territories, where a Palestinian uprising has raged for four months.
   An Arafat aide, who declined to give his name, said the news of
the assassination made Arafat ``determined to reply to it by
stepping up a thousandfold the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza.''
   Arafat called al-Wazir's wife and told her ``our march is long
and you have to be patient and surmount your pain so we can carry
on with the mission he started,'' said the source, who was in the
room at the time.
   Arafat could not be reached for comment. He has been touring
Persian Gulf states for the last few days and today flew to Riyahd,
the capital of Saudi Arabia, for talks with leaders there.
Diplomatic sources had said he was not expected to fly directly to
Tunis for security reasons.
   Al-Wazir was killed two months after three of his senior
officers were assassinated in Limassol, Cyprus, as they arranged
the charter of a ship to carry Palestinian deportees on a protest
voyage to Israel.
   The Palestinians blamed the Israelis for the deaths.
   In Cairo, an Egyptian official denounced the assassination as
``a criminal act directed against the Palestinian leadership.'' The
brief statement by the minister of state for foreign affairs,
Butros Ghali, made no mention of the PLO charge that Israel was
responsible.
   The assassination was similar to one carried out in Beirut in
April 9, 1973, in which three Palestinian leaders were killed by
Israeli commandos who came in from the sea.
   The victims were Mohamad Najjar, Kamal Nasser and Kamal Adwan.
   Najjar, codenamed Abu Youssef, was the head of Fatah's military
branch. Nasser was a member of the executive committee, and Adwan
was responsible for activities in Israeli-occupied territories.

<HEAD>Dukakis Questioned About Absence of Campaign in New York's Harlem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis made one of his first
visits to Harlem on Saturday and was challenged by a critic who
said his presidential campaign was ignoring the area's black voters.
   During a breakfast with 40 black bankers, business and community
leaders, critic Robert La Prince said he saw no evidence that
Dukakis' campaign had waged any effort in Harlem and added it was a
mistake for him to write off the predominantly black neighborhood
despite rival Jesse Jackson's unquestioned strength.
   Dukakis responded, ``The Jackson campaign isn't that active in
Astoria,'' a reference to the Greek neighborhood of Queens where
the Massachusetts governor drew more than 2,000 people in an
emotional outpouring of support two days earlier.
   ``I understand Jesse's going to get the lion's share of the
votes in this community, and that's understandable,'' Dukakis said,
adding that he has enjoyed black support too.
   La Prince pressed him on the absence of even placards and
handbills. ``We'll get some signs out,'' Dukakis replied.
   La Prince, who described himself as president of the National
Council for Culture and Art, said later: ``It's evident the
campaign is ignoring the Harlem community ... I think it's
unfortunate.''
   Dukakis told reporters he couldn't recall if he had campaigned
in Harlem before, saying the visit was ``one of the first.''
   As Dukakis was confronted with the criticism, his campaign began
airing a radio commercial targeted at black audiences. The ad says
Dukakis has appointed blacks to top jobs while the ``Reagan-Bush
administration turned its back on Black Americans.'' It also
accuses Vice President George Bush, the inevitable GOP nominee, of
``cheerleading efforts to turn back the clock on equal
opportunity.''
   Dukakis flew upstate after spending the morning in New York
City, where he also walked with a small crowd along a street in an
Italian neighborhood in Queens.
   ``We're going to begin to work with communities _ that's what
America is all about,'' Dukakis said. ``I'm a community guy.''
   A young woman shouted a question to him about ``fiscal
discipline'' and followed up by asking if he would raise taxes.
   ``I hope not,'' Dukakis said and then repeated his call for
tougher enforcement of income taxes.
   He was throwing out the ceremonial first ball at a minor league
baseball game in Buffalo, where a light snow fell in a blustery
cold, and later joining Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
for a League of Women Voters debate in Rochester.
   Dukakis' aides contended polls showed the New York race
tightening as Tuesday's primary drew closer. Dukakis sidestepped
questions about whether his candidacy could sustain a loss in New
York to Jackson, and contended he was not moved to over-confidence
by polls that showed him ahead.
   ``Assuming one is going to win because one is ahead in the polls
is very, very bad policy,'' the Massachusetts governor said.

<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's
weekly radio address delivered from Camp David, Md.:
   My fellow Americans, the news has been bad lately, and that's
good _ and here's why: You probably have been hearing about
Panamanian strongman General (Manuel) Noriega who's been indicted
in drug trafficking and his struggle to stay in power despite
pressure from his own people and ou government to step down. You've
also been hearing about the drug-related arrests of many street
gang members in Los Angeles.
   And then too, there's the news about congressional
investigations of organized crime's involvement in the drug trade.
   Now, these news reports reflect an important change since the
start of our administration in 1981. At the time, we faced a crisis
of crime stemming from the illegal drug trade, especially in south
Florida.
   At my urging, Vice President Bush headed up a task force that
performed invaluable service by coordinating the activities of all
law enforcement agencies in the area, and for the first time,
brought to bear against the drug smugglers, the full weight of
federal resources.
   This included high-tech military equipment and the resources of
the intelligence community. Less than a year later, I went over to
the Justice Department to announce a sweeping effort to break the
back of organized crime in America. And a key part of this approach
was the hiring of more than a thousand new agents and prosecutors
as part of 12 regional drug task forces based on the south Florida
model.
   We also set up a President's Commission on Organized Crime that
did landmark work in tracing the international connections of the
domestic drug trade pointing out the usefulness of drug testing,
and exposing not only the old-style mafia's involvement in the drug
trade, but also the danger of new emerging crime gangs.
   In addition to all this, we got enacted sweeping legislative
initiatives like the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 and
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. This early attention to the
criminal side of the drug problem, which has translated into a
tripling of the overall anti-drug budget, is now paying dividends.
Cocaine seizures have increased by over 1800 percent. Arrest of
major drug traffickers have increased by almost 200 percent, and
well over $500 million in drug-related assets were seized in 1987
alone.
   And this kind of success at the federal level would not be
possible without an unprecedented degree of federal, state and
local cooperation. Here in Washington this commitment is best
evidenced by our cabinet-level National Drug Policy Board as well
as the Vice President's National Narcotic Border Interdiction
System, and the Department of Justice's Organized Crime Drug
Enforcement Task Forces.
   But emphasizing the criminal side of the drug problem is only
part of defeating the drug menace. Thanks to the efforts of Nancy's
``Just Say No'' campaign, Americans are understanding that the
permanent way to end the drug menace is to deny the drug pusher his
market to stop demand. And that means education and prevention. It
means understanding that drug use is not a victimless crime, that
drugs kill and maim and finance the criminal underground. It means
accepting the concept of user responsibility. It means realizing
that those who use drugs are, in Nancy's words, ``making themselves
accomplices to murder.''
   Now in addition to prevention and education and drug law
enforcement, we have also been emphasizing the international side
of the problem. When we came into office, there were drug
eradication programs underway in only two countries. Today that
number is 23.
   In fact this administration has signed an unprecedented number
of mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties, and
eradication agreements.
   The unprecedented indictment of Panamanian leader Noriega for
drug trafficking by a U.S. Grand Jury is a further indication of
our nation's resolve to end the foreign supply of drug. His nation
is in a crisis of his making.
   But as I said at the beginning, the fact that we're seeing more
media coverage of the drug problem, and the heat put on people like
   General Noriega and the street gangs in Los Angeles or organized
crime in general is good news. Public awareness about the
destructiveness of illegal drugs is at an all-time high. Americans
are increasingly saying ``no'' to drugs. A recent survey of high
school seniors showed a significant drop in cocain and marijuana
use.
   We have a long way to go before we have a drug-free America, and
I hope the media keeps emphasizing that point, but it's also true
America has awakened to this problem. That's quite a change from
just a decade ago.
   So that's the good news, the very good news, about the bad news
of drug abuse.
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

<HEAD>Brain Cells From Aborted Fetus Used In Surgical Procedure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brain cells from an aborted fetus were implanted
into two Britons suffering from Parkinson's disease in a surgical
procedure banned in the United States, doctors said Saturday.
   The operations were the first of their kind in Britain, said
neurologist Edward Hitchcock, of the Midland Center for
Neurosurgery and Neurology.
   Hitchcock operated on a severely disabled 60-year-old woman
March 3 and on a 41-year-old man April 7.
   Both patients have been discharged from the hospital near
Birmingham in west-central England and have discontinued the
medication they were taking for the crippling disease, Hitchcock
said in a statement.
   The hospital would not release the patients' names nor that of
the woman whose aborted fetus was used in the procedure.
   Press Association, the domestic British news agency, and
Independent Television News said the woman was unaware that cells
from her aborted fetus had been transplanted. The hospital had no
immediate comment on the report.
   Parkinson's disease causes gradual loss of muscle control and is
potentially fatal. The implanted fetal tissue is believed to
stimulate production of dopamine, a brain chemical lacking in
people who suffer from Parkinson's.
   Hitchcock said the operations, performed under local anesthetic,
involve transplanting the fetus' cells into the patient's brain
through a surgical procedure that involves making a small hole in
the skull.
   The first documented use of the experimental procedure was
revealed in January, when surgeons in Mexico City said they
injected tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains of two
Parkinson's sufferers last September.
   Researchers in Sweden also have reported using a similar
technique.
   ``The results obtained so far have been more than satisfactory,
giving a new revolution to world medical science, particularly in
the field of neurosurgery,'' the Mexican Social Security Institute
said in a statement in January.
   In Washington on Friday, government scientists were denied
permission to attempt the procedure because of legal, medical and
ethical questions.
   But the Department of Health and Human Services instructed the
National Institutes of Health to appoint an outside advisory
committee to examine the implications of using tissue from
intentionally aborted fetuses.
   The prohibition does not ban continuing research on tissue from
fetuses from miscarriages or stillbirths, but that type generally
is not feasible to use in the kind of transplant research the NIH
contemplated.
   Hitchcock, a professor of neurology at the University of
Birmingham, said the ethics of the procedure were reviewed by the
hospital's ethical committee. The government and the Medical
Research Council, which sets professional standards, were kept
informed, he said.
   ``We have been preparing for this kind of operation for several
years,'' he said. ``All the ethical issues have been carefully
considered over a very long period.''
   Hitchcock said the fetus involved was aborted ``well within the
time limits'' set by current British law and within a proposed law
before Parliament.
   Women in Britain now can have abortions until the 28th week of
pregnancy, although the proposed law would set a limit of 18 weeks.
   Dr. Michael Harrison, chairman of the Sandwell Health Authority,
which administers the hospital, said that if the ethical committee
had any doubts ``about anything, they turn it down.''
   ``Any research that is done, that has the benefits we hope to
have, is to be welcomed,'' Harrison said.
   ``Parkinson's disease is absolutely dreadful. It is a disease
that affects the brain and the patient's ability to think and to
move. It makes them shuffle along. It is dreadful and ultimately
fatal.''
   Hospital administrator Glyn James said fetal tissue is often
used for research in Britain.
   ``This is nothing like a brain transplant, or even a
quarter-brain transplant,'' he said. ``It only involves very, very
small pieces of cells.''

   The world's longest survivor of a five-organ
transplant remained in serious condition Saturday, one day after
doctors performed minor surgery to correct a problem with her new
liver.
   Tabatha Foster, 3{, has had periodic problems with her liver
since the operation five months ago, said Lynn McMahon, spokeswoman
for Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   The doctors on Friday inserted a tube into her liver to drain
bile that accumulated because of a compressed duct, said Ms.
McMahon.
   ``It's usually a successful procedure,'' the spokeswoman said.
   The girl's condition was lowered from fair to serious on Friday.
   The Madisonville, Ky., toddler is the world's longest survivor
of a five-organ transplant. Her parents, Roy and Sandra Foster,
were at her bedside in a private room.
   ``She's still in the recovery stage. But there's every
expectation that when she fully regains consciousness, she'll
return to the fun-loving state where she was prior to this
procedure,'' Ms. McMahon said.
   The doctors were not immediately certain whether Tabatha
sustained any permanent liver damage. Her other transplanted organs
appear to be functioning well, Ms. McMahon said.
   The girl was born with short gut syndrome, a fatal, congenital
deformation of her intestines. Her liver later failed as a result
of her highly concentrated liquid diet.
   Tabatha received a new liver, pancreas, small intestines and
parts of a stomach and colon Nov. 1. She needed only a new liver
and small intestine to survive, but doctors said it was less
complicated to transplant the five-organ group.
   ``Tabatha is such a resilient kid,'' said Sue Cardillo, another
spokeswoman.
   The multiple transplant, considered experimental, previously had
been performed only twice in the United States. Both patients died.

<HEAD>Denison President Says Resignation Coincidental To Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRANVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Denison University said
his resignation does not have anything to do with student protests
over a racial incident and called the timing ``a curious and
fateful irony.''
   Andrew G. De Rocco submitted his resignation Friday after four
years as president of the 2,200-student school. Charles A.
Brickman, chairman of Denison's board of trustees, said the board
accepted with regret.
   On Tuesday, De Rocco suspended two white students for the rest
of the current academic year. The University Judicial Board had
found them guilty of racially harassing a black student.
   The judicial board had ordered the students suspended for the
fall semester, but blacks said the punishment was lenient and last
week held rallies and called for class boycotts. The protest was
called off after De Rocco ordered the two white students off campus.
   ``My agonies about the next stage of my career began some months
ago. It's a curious and fateful irony that the other events were
coincidental,'' with the resignation, De Rocco said Friday night.
``It's accidental but not causal.''
   Denison spokesman Stewart B. Dyke said De Rocco was not
pressured by the trustees. ``The board voted a resolution fully
supporting the actions Andrew De Rocco took,'' Dyke said.
   De Rocco, 58, became president of the central Ohio liberal arts
college in 1984. He came to Denison from Trinity College in
Hartford, Conn., and had been a research physicist.
   ``As the time draws near for implementing Denison's long-range
plan, it has become clear to me that the commitment needed to
realize it would be more than I could reasonably give and still
contemplate future career options for myself,'' De Rocco said in a
news release issued Friday.
   Brickman said that Trustee William T. McConnell, president of
the Park National Corp. in Newark, would head a committee to search
for a successor.

   Thirty-five people whose boat
drifted for 10 days in the Atlantic Ocean were brought safely to
Puerto Rico on Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
   Lt. Armin Cate, a Coast Guard spokesman, said those rescued from
the 35-foot launch included 13 women. He said 30 were from the
Dominican Republic, three were from Jamaica and the other two were
former residents of Chile. He said some carried false passports.
   All of them were reported in relatively good physical condition,
although some suffered from exposure. One of the women was pregnant.
   Authorities said the craft left the Dutch island of St. Maarten
but the craft's destination was not known. Further details about
what happened to the boat were not immediately available.
   The boat was spotted Thursday by crewmembers on a sailboat 190
miles north of St. Thomas, part of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The
sailboat's captain called the U.S. Coast Guard in St. Thomas.
   The Coast Guard cutter Nantucket towed the craft to San Juan,
and all those aboard were turned over to U.S. Immigration Service
officials.

<DATELINE>OXFORD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustees at Miami University on Saturday
unanimously defeated a proposal by several student organizations to
eliminate the term ``freshman'' for first-year students.
   Trustees also voted 5-3 against changing the words of the
school's alma mater to strike male references from the 1910 lyrics.
   The trustees said changing the label to ``first-year students''
would cause confusion. And alumni disapproved of altering the
school song, the trustees said.
   ``I'm disgusted and I'm glad I'm graduating,'' said Elizabeth
Braeman, a senior from Washington, D.C., who proposed the changes.
   She said it would have been appropriate to make the changes this
year, which marks the 100th anniversary of women being admitted to
the school.
   Ms. Braeman, also a student government leader, said the Student
Senate, the Student Affairs Council and the University Senate had
earlier approved the recommendations.
   ``It wasn't just Liz Braeman on a rampage. It was approved by
the three governing bodies of the university,'' said Ms. Braeman,
who is a member of a campus group called the Association for Women
Students.
   The feminist organization recently staged a sit-in, picketed a
campus beauty pageant and criticized the administration for not
doing enough to prevent sexual harassment or to assure the safety
of women students walking on the campus at night. University
officials say they are dealing with those issues.
   The women's group has about 30 members on Miami's 15,000-student
main campus here in southwestern Ohio, about 30 miles north of
Cincinnati.
   The changes in the alma mater, ``Old Miami, New Miami,'' would
have converted ``While thy sons have quested from thee'' to ``All
thy students questing from thee;'' ``Men shall ever seek thy
guiding'' to ``We shall ever seek thy guiding,'' and ``Youth and
maiden throng thy gate'' to ``Men and women throng thy gate.''
   Ms. Braeman said the references are sexist and dated because
they refer to males only, and should be eliminated as part of a
program to remove such terms from use in official university
publications.
   Paul Pearson, Miami's president, recommended the trustees
approve changing the song but took no position on the term freshman.

   Experts on Japan's terrorist Red Army said Saturday
that the small but vicious leftist band is stepping up its
activities with funds and supplies provided by radical Arab leftist
groups.
   On Tuesday, New Jersey police arrested a suspected member of the
Red Army carrying three homemade bombs. In Italy, a well-known Red
Army member is being sought on suspicion of planting a car bomb
that killed an American servicewoman and four Italians in Naples on
Thursday.
   The Red Army, a radical splinter from the now defunct leftist
General Federation of Japanese Students, was active in the 1970s
after an estimated 30 members fled to the Middle East, calling it
the center of world revolution.
   Their attacks included a massacre at Tel Aviv's Lod airport in
Israel in 1972 that left 28 people dead. Before last week's
violence, the band most recently claimed responsibility for bomb
and rocket attacks on the U.S. and British embassies in Rome.
   No one was injured in those attacks, which took place in Rome on
June 9, 1987 while the leaders of seven Western nations were
holding their annual summit in Venice.
   Police officials would not comment on local news reports that
the Red Army was feared to be planning attacks on the summit of the
advanced industrial nations in Toronto in June and the summer
Olympic Games in Seoul in September.
   But Akio Ohno, a veteran police critic, said the summit and the
Olympic Games would be two possible targets.
   ``The Red Army has openly criticized the South Korean government
for its pro-American stance, and it maintains that its ultimate
goal is a world revolution to destroy capitalism,'' Ohno said.
   Ohno, who lead the once powerful student organization in the
1950s, said the Red Army is now believed to work with Arab leftists
and is led by Fusako Shigenobu, a college dropout who once worked
as a Tokyo bar hostess to raise Red Army funds.
   Naples police said Saturday that Ms. Shigenobu is suspected of
helping plant the bomb at the USO club that killed five people
Thursday. She also has been identified as a key figure in the Lod
massacre.
   Another police critic, Ro Takenaka, said the arrest of Yu
Kikumura, 35, in New Jersey might well suggest that the Red Army is
trying to expand its theater of operations to the United States.
   ``They have the talent of making bombs. I believe Kikumura
himself made the three bombs he was carrying,'' Takenaka told The
Associated Press.
   Ohno said the arrest last fall of Osamu Maruoka, 37, who had
been on the international wanted list for alleged involvement in
the Lod massacre, was another indication the group might have
planned attacks on South Korean targets, possibly including Olympic
facilities, to dramatize its activity.
   Maruoka, considered by police as the No. 2 Red Army leader, was
arrested Nov. 21 in Tokyo after arriving on a flight from Hong Kong
with a false passport.
   Subsequent police investigations showed Maruoka had reserved a
one-way ticket to Seoul the following month.
   At Lod Airport on May 30, 1972, Kozo Okamoto, then 24, Tsuyoshi
Okudaira, 26, and Yasuyuki Yasuda, 25, sprayed machine gun fire and
hurled hand grenades into the airport's crowded luggage collection
area.
   In addition to 26 civilian victims, mostly Puerto Rican
pilgrims, Okudaira and Yasuda were killed. Okamoto was seized by
Israeli security officers.
   Okamoto was among 1,100 Palestinian and other prisoners freed by
Israel as part of an exchange for Israeli soldiers in Geneva,
Switzerland, in May 1985.
   Okudaira's younger brother, Junzo, now being sought in Italy for
the car-bomb attack Thursday, first joined the Red Army in the
Middle East in 1974 after slipping out of Japan with a false
passport.
   The younger Okudaira allegedly joined in an attack on the French
Embassy at the Hague later in 1974 and an attack on the U.S.
Embassy in Kuala Lumpur in 1975.
   He was arrested in Jordan in 1976 on charges of possessing a
false passport and deported to Japan, but was freed in 1977 when
the Red Army hijackers of a Japan Air Lines jet in Bangladesh
demanded his release.
   The Red Army had no more than 300 members at its peak following
its formation in 1968, according to police estimates. Following
police crackdowns later in the 1960s, about 30 members slipped out
of Japan to operate abroad.
   Police action and internal feuding, climaxing with the murder of
14 members at the group's mountain hideout in Japan in 1971,
sharply sapped its strength within Japan.

   A cinder block fell off a truck and
crashed through a car windshield, hitting a young woman driver in
the face and leaving her in serious condition Saturday after
surgery to rebuild facial bones, officials said.
   Reconstructive surgeons at Halifax Medical Center toiled for
nine hours on Mary Stoll, 20, after the Thursday accident about 10
miles east of DeLand.
   ``Apparently she can hear us but she doesn't respond,'' said her
father, Tom Stoll, who kept a vigil over his daughter's bed in the
intensive care unit.
   Miss Stoll was alone when cinder blocks came loose on a
westbound flatbed truck driven by Furman Mitchum, 37, of Edgewater.
After the block crashed through her windshield, her car veered off
the road and hit a small palm tree.
   No charges had been filed but police said Mitchum, who works for
Tarmac Florida Inc., could be charged with driving with an unsafe
load.
   ``It's not legal for your load to be shifting or dropping or
blowing, in the case of sand,'' said Florida Highway Patrol trooper
Gary Schluter.
   ``As far as I know it was secured properly,'' Tarmac manager
Ronald Sweeney said of the truck.
   Miss Stoll, a junior from Bradenton, ranked No. 1 in singles and
last year was voted the most valuable player of her Stetson
University women's tennis team.

   A bomb exploded Saturday in a parking lot,
and a fire truck rushing to the scene crashed into a building and
killed five people, officials reported.
   Jordanian officials blamed Israel for the bombing. A spokesman
for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said such accusations were
``nonesense.''
   The explosion was the second in a week.
   An spokesman for the Interior Ministry said the blast started a
fire in a parking lot in the basement of the city's six-story
municipality building in downtown Amman but caused no casualties.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bomb
had been placed under a car and contained 1.1 pounds of explosives.
   The official Jordan News Agency quoted a government spokesman as
saying the bombing ``took place after Jordan explained its position
in supporting the Arab rights in Palestine.''
   ``This act was carried out by a group ... recruited as agents
and traitors by our enemy (Israel),'' the spokesman said, without
elaboration.
   A security colonel at the scene said the car, which was empty,
caught fire.
   As the fire truck was rushing to the scene it sped out of
control on a steep hill and smashed into a building. Five people
were killed and four others were seriously injured.
   The driver and another civil defense worker were among the dead.
   A civil defense spokesman said the driver drove the truck into
the building because ``he was trying to avoid killing people'' on
crowded sidewalks.
   ``He was leaning out the window screaming `get out of the way,'
as he headed toward the building,'' a witness said.

   A man who had been imprisoned for
stealing money from his former employer has been accused of
returning to the elderly woman's house and killing her, two weeks
after his release.
   Isaac Fields, 31, was charged Friday with murder, kidnapping and
burglary, said Maj. Larry Campbell of the Leon County Sheriff's
office. Other charges were pending.
   The body of 79-year-old Jane May Dougherty, who suffered from
rheumatoid arthritis and was unable to walk without a cane, was
found inside a storage room in her home.
   Campbell said she was struck on the head Tuesday with a blunt
instrument, but investigators did not find the body until Thursday,
even though they had been looking for her since she disappeared.
   Sheriff's spokesman Dick Simpson also said initial evidence
indicated she had been kidnapped.
   Ms. Dougherty had hired Fields to help with her gardening,
neighbors said.
   Last May, Fields was charged with stealing money and checks from
her. Campbell said he went into her house and rifled through her
purse.
   He was convicted of forgery, burglary and grand theft on Oct. 6
and was sentenced to three years in prison. However, he was
released March 31.
   Campbell declined to speculate if revenge was a factor in the
slaying.

   Douglas Fairbanks Jr. may have been a
romantic leading man on and off screen in his heyday, but don't
expect a lot of kiss-and-tell stories in ``The Salad Days,'' the
first installment of a two-volume autobiography.
   ``I don't like washing dirty linen or telling tales,''
Fairbanks, 78, said in a recent interview. ``I don't like done to
me and I don't like it done to other people. Nobody likes it. I
didn't write this to make a lot of money. If it does become a best
seller that's fine. If it doesn't, the kids will enjoy reading
about another generation.''
   Fairbanks, whose films included ``The Dawn Patrol,'' ``Prisoner
of Zenda'' and ``Gunga Din,'' was married briefly to Joan Crawford
and had romances with such leading ladies as Gertrude Lawrence and
Marlene Dietrich.

   Rock star Michael Jackson has pledged more
than $130,000 to help provide immunizations for children in
developing countries, a British charity announced Saturday.
   Give for Life, a charity based in Leeds, said Jackson has
promised to make the donation from proceeds of a concert he is to
give in this northern England city on Aug. 29.
   The charity is trying to raise $1.9 million to immunize 40,000
children against diseases such as measles, diptheria, polio and
tuberculosis.
   A Jackson spokesman, Jonathan Morrish, said: ``This is something
that Michael wanted to do because he is visiting Leeds. He does
this sort of thing quite often in America when there is an
association between a particular charity and a city where he is

   Former automaker John Z. De Lorean has filed a
$610 million federal lawsuit against several lawyers and
accountants, claiming they conspired to destroy his business
operations and personal reputation.
   In the suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in San Diego, De
Lorean said the lawyers and accountants maliciously prosecuted him
in violation of federal racketeering laws, the Detroit Free Press
reported Saturday.
   He added that the group's actions caused him emotional distress
and damaged his business.
   De Lorean settled his car company's bankruptcy case in August,
when he agreed to pay $9.36 million to creditors.
   Those named in the suit include Sheldon Toll and Robert Weiss,
lawyers for the Detroit firm of Honigman Miller Schwartz & Cohn;
Yale Levin, an accounting executive who has worked for Price
Waterhouse & Co. in Detroit; and a group of British accountants,
the newspaper said.
   ``All the things people said about me were fabricated,'' De
Lorean said. ``These people cost me a lot of money to defend myself
and I think it's only right they be held accountable.''
   Weiss called the suit ``utterly preposterous,'' the Free Press
said Saturday. It said most of those named in the suit couldn't be
reached for comment.
   The De Lorean Motor Co. went bankrupt after De Lorean was
arrested on cocaine trafficking charges in 1981.
   He was acquitted of the cocaine charges in Los Angeles federal
court and later was cleared of racketeering charge in Detroit
federal court. In the latter case, he was accused of defrauding
investors of $8.5 million.

   Doc Watson, the blind entertainer who is
an icon of traditional mountain music, says he's still not sure
when he will retire.
   Since a tractor overturned and killed his son at his own farm
near Lenoir 2{ years ago, Watson, 65, has wrestled with thoughts of
quitting. He announced his retirement early this year, but
rescinded the decision last month.
   ``I've always told everybody I'd like to quit the road when I'm
still able to carry in a stick of firewood or do a chore around
here,'' Watson said.
   ``I was going to quit the end of June, then next March. Let's
just leave it hang right now.''
   The Grammy Award-winner and more than 20 other performers will
appear at a festival in Wilkesboro on April 30 and May 1 to raise
money for the ``Eddy Merle Watson Garden of the Senses,'' a garden
for the blind named for Watson's late son, at Wilkes Community
College.
   Other performers include Chet Atkins, Grandpa Jones, Earl
Scruggs, Mac Wiseman, Tony Rice, John Hartford, the New-grass
Revival, George Hamilton IV, David Holt, the Moody Brothers and
Mike Cross.
   The garden will consist of raised planters containing fragrant
plants that appeal to the sense of touch. All plants will be
identified in Braille. There will be a small stone memorial to the
younger Watson.
   Watson believes his son, who died at age 36, deserves a
memorial. For himself, Watson wants only ``a small bunch of
old-fashioned marigolds.''

   Trumpeter Al Hirt, who's been plagued by trouble
with his playing arm, was released from the hospital Saturday
morning ready to to resume performing immediately, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Hirt returned to Methodist Hospital on April 6 to be treated for
inflammation of tendons in his right hand and arm, spokeswoman
Brenda Blake said.
   The inflammation was related to an infection he had in the same
hand and arm for which he underwent treatment last month at
Methodist.
   Dr. Michael DeBakey, Hirt's physician and friend, is optimistic
about the musician's recovery.
   ``We have recommended that he continue taking antibiotics and
rest his hand and arm between performances for the next two to
three weeks,'' DeBakey said. ``The long-term prognosis for his hand
is excellent and he can return to his performing engagements
immediately.''
   His manager, Gwen Campbell, said Hirt was to resume his normal
schedule Saturday night, appearing in Sioux Falls, S.D., with the
Sioux Falls Symphony.

   Gunmen believed to be leftist
guerrillas kidnapped and killed the rightist mayor of a small
northeastern town, a provincial governor said Saturday.
   Morazan province governor Francisco Valenzuela said in a
telephone interview that the mayor of San Isidro, Pedro Ventura,
was kidnapped on Thursday and his bullet-riddled body was found on
nearby road on Friday, but gave no further details.
   Valenzuela said he and police investigators believe the gunmen
belonged to the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a
coalition of five guerrilla groups that has been fighting for power
since October 1979.
   The guerrillas have several strongholds in Morazan province,
especially a few miles north of San Isidro. The town is 107 miles
northeast of San Salvador.
   Ventura, 55, was a member of the Republican Nationalist
Alliance, a rightist group, which won control of the National
Legislature in elections March 20.
   Its founder, retired army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson, has been
linked by press reports to rightist death squads, which have hunted
down and killed suspected leftist guerrillas for many years.
D'Aubuisson has repeatedly denied the accusations.
   In a related development, police sources said a group of
guerrillas attacked a coffee plantation northwest of the capital on
Friday night and set fire to several warehouses and other buildings.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
rebels attacked the Colombia coffee plantation outside
Quezaltepeque, 15 miles northwest of the capital. They said no one
was hurt.

   Here is a transcript of the Democratic radio
address, delivered Saturday by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee:
   This is Congressman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois. I'd like to
talk to you about the trade legislation that is nearing completion
in Congress.
   For too many years, the United States has been without a
coherent trade policy. This has been true in both Democratic and
Republican administrations. Trade has simply been ignored and the
effect of this inattention has been devastating. In the space of a
few years, we have gone from being the world's largest creditor
nation to the world's largest debtor. The result has been the loss
of American jobs and a growing dependence on foreign investment.
   In the coming weeks, we will have an opportunity to begin the
reversal of this alarming trend. The House and Senate are about to
approve and send to the president the most comprehensive trade bill
ever considered in the Congress. This legislation is the result of
a three-year, bipartisan effort to develop a strong, cohesive trade
policy _ one that is designed to open markets, centralize our trade
decision-making process and assist U.S. workers.
   The legislative process has been both time-consuming and
controversial. We had to resist strong protectionist sentiments
that demanded we erect our own trade barriers. We also had to
overcome a ``business as usual'' indifference on the part of the
current administration.
   Our legislative goal was a trade bill that was so strong our
trading partners could not ignore it and so fair that the president
would have to sign it. I think we've succeeded.
   The message this bill sends to our trading partners is strong
and clear: We expect their markets to be open to U.S. goods. We
streamline the process of resolving trade disputes. We give our
trade negotiator the tools to attack trade agreement violations and
we require him to use those tools. But our message is not one of
belligerence, it simply says we want fair trade. I have met with
foreign trade ministers in Europe and Asia. They not only expect
this message, they accept it.
   Like any bill of this size and scope, the legislation is not
perfect. At various stages, it has been criticized. The president,
in particular, has been a vocal critic of several provisions. I had
hoped for greater cooperation from the president in the development
of the bill, but he elected instead to simply list his objections.
Although this made it difficult to reach compromises, the final
product addresses many of the president's concerns.
   Many doubted we could agree on a strong trade bill that avoided
protectionist measures. In fact, many in the administration were
hoping for a bill that was so protectionist the president could
easily veto it. Well, they are going to be disappointed.
   In recent days, I've heard complaints that we've gone too far
and complaints that we have not gone far enough. My 30 years as a
legislator tells me that when a bill is attacked by both sides,
it's probably pretty good legislation.
   The Congress has done a responsible job in strengthening our
trade laws and avoiding protectionist measures. Now it's up to the
president. It took us three years to get this far. We can't afford
to let our trade policy drift any longer. The president can put us
on the right course by signing this landmark legislation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's choice for
the No. 2 job in the Justice Department is taking the weekend to
think about whether he wants to accept the position, a department
spokesman said Saturday.
   John C. Shepherd, the St. Louis attorney recommended by Meese
for deputy attorney general, set no firm time for informing the
attorney general of his decision, but ``did want to use the weekend
to get away with his family and think it over,'' said Patrick
Korten, a department spokesman.
   Another Justice Department spokesman, Terry Eastland, late
Friday confirmed that Shepherd, in a meeting with Meese,
``expressed reservations ... based on family concerns.''
   An administration source said Shepherd and his wife were upset
that Meese's recommendation had focused unwanted attention and
publicity on the trial of a former bookkeeper in his law firm and
the woman's allegations about Shepherd.
   Denise Sinner, who was convicted of making false statements and
stealing money from the firm, alleged during her trial that she had
an affair with Shepherd and that he had given her permission to
write checks to herself from the firm.
   Shepherd has denied both allegations. Calls to his St. Louis
office went unanswered Saturday. His home number is unlisted.
   In an interview published Saturday in The Washington Post,
Shepherd said he had not decided yet whether to withdraw from
consideration for the job.
   But he said he told Meese on Friday of the ``tremendous pressure
that this whole ordeal has been on me and my wife. ... It's more
severe than anybody could have anticipated.''
   Shepherd, a former president of the American Bar Association,
was named by Meese to succeed Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns.
Since then, he has come under scrutiny because of his membership in
an all-white country club and an all-male social club.
   Meese said Friday he knows of ``no problem'' with the
nominations of Shepherd or Francis A. Keating II, who the attorney
general has recommended as associate attorney general.
   Meese announced the Shepherd and Keating recommendations April 5
while President Reagan was vacationing in California and after
several other people who were approached about the jobs either were
rejected by the White House or said they were not interested.
   Keating, assistant treasury secretary for enforcement, belongs
to an all-white country club in Tulsa, Okla. He was quoted by the
New York Daily News on Friday as saying he would resign his
membership only if ``it's established that there's been intentional
discrimination.''

Investments</HEAD>

   Americans are pessimistic about the U.S.
economy and want to restrict foreign investment in the United
States, according to a U.S. News & World Report survey released
Saturday.
   Only 17 percent of 1,004 adults interviewed said the country has
a bright economic future. Fifty-nine percent said the outlook was
``just so-so'' and 21 percent called it ``gloomy,'' the magazine
reported.
   The survey by The Roper Organization showed 84 percent of those
questioned believe it is not good for the United States for foreign
companies to buy up more and more real estate. The survey, which
was conducted March 30-31, had a 4 percent margin of error.
   Eighty-two percent said restrictions should be placed on foreign
purchases of U.S. companies making national-security products, with
78 percent favoring such restrictions on real estate purchases and
72 percent on the takeover of any manufacturing or high-technology
companies.
   Respondents were most opposed to investments by Arabs, followed
by Asians, while a little more than half said they were comfortable
with European investments and three-fourths with investments by
Canadians.
   The survey questionnaire gave respondents a choice of four
descriptions of how well or badly the United States is competing
with other industrialized nations.
   Forty-five percent chose: ``We are slipping dangerously, but can
still turn it around if we act decisively.''
   Twenty-seven percent checked: ``We are still number one, but
other nations are catching up with us very quickly.''
   Sixteen percent picked: ``We are in a period of long-term
economic decline and will eventually lose our position as number
one.''
   Only 8 percent agreed with: ``We are number one and will remain
the strongest, most dynamic economy in the world.''
   The survey asked about half of those interviewed if they thought
it was a good idea for foreign companies to build plants in the
United States and got more disapproval than approval. The other
half were asked the same question, but the interviewer pointed out
that this would provide new American jobs, and the response was
reversed.

   A state senate candidate toting 50
paperback novels chained himself to the only bridge that leads to
Cape Hatteras and pledged Saturday to stay there until action is
taken to save the bridge from erosion.
   Dan Lawrence, who owns a mobile-home park in the Outer Banks
community of Frisco on Hatteras Island, attached his leg to a fence
along the catwalk of the Herbert C. Bonner bridge over Oregon Inlet
on Friday morning.
   ``I'm going to stay here until they carry me away. This is
something the governor is going to have to think about because he's
the man who needs to act on this. We need positive action,'' the
42-year-old Republican said Saturday.
   Lawrence, who took along raingear, the paperbacks, a transistor
radio and a cooler full of non-alcoholic beverages, said he has
also started a hunger strike.
   The 3{-mile structure, the only route from the mainland to the
island's vacation and fishing communities, was threatened by heavy
erosion from a storm Wednesday that also damaged 30 homes along the
Outer Banks.
   Gov. Jim Martin flew in Thursday and called for jetties to
stabilize Oregon Inlet's shifting sands. A project authorized by
Congress 17 years ago has never been built, mostly due to
opposition from environmentalists and the U.S. Department of the
Interior. They say jetties won't work in the long run and would be
environmentally hazardous.
   Lawrence, who keeps the key to the padlock in his boot, took the
chain off several times Saturday to get his circulation going. His
wife, Karen, and son, Matthew, were with him Saturday afternoon.
They brought food but Lawrence, who said he has only had water,
chicken broth and apple juice, refused it.
   ``I felt like the loneliest man in the world (Friday night),''
Lawrence told Outer Banks radio station WOBR. ``I've never been
through an experience like that _ just bone-chilling.''
   An officer at the Coast Guard's Oregon Inlet station said
Lawrence had weathered a thunderstorm and several showers
overnight. The National Weather Service said the temperature at
Oregon Inlet was 47 degrees Friday night, with temperatures
Saturday night expected to drop to 40 to 45 degrees.
   ``I might go to the end of the bridge and sleep in my truck ...
to keep away from the wind. I'm still keeping up my hunger
strike,'' said Lawrence. ``I don't know what's going to happen ...
I'm about ready to drop now.''
   State transportation officials said about 275 feet of shoreline
near the southern end of the bridge was washed away during last
week's storm. If the rapid erosion continues, the base of the
bridge would be vulnerable to waves and undercutting.
   W.D. Campbell, an engineer with the state Division of Highways,
said better weather had reduced the threat. But he said the
long-range threat remained and that state agencies were continuing
to draw up plans to protect the bridge.
   ``The bridge is going to be washed away with the next nor'easter
that comes through here,'' said Lawrence at a Friday news
conference. ``The result is going to be catastrophe for Hatteras
Island. People will die.''
   ``I believe a person can live about 30 days (without food), and
I'm prepared to stay here until I die,'' said Lawrence, wearing a
red cap and sitting in a chair at the end of a catwalk about a
quarter-mile from the Hatteras Island side of the bridge.
   ``My mother lives here. A lot of people's mothers, fathers and
grandparents live here,'' he said.
   Karen Hayes Rotterman, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jim Martin, said
Martin would have no comment.
   Orman Mann, chairman of the Dare County Oregon Inlet and
Waterways Commission, which has been fighting for the jetties, said
he thought Lawrence's act ``shows the frustration of the local
people.''
   Pat Mullaney, of Charlottesville, Va., who was fishing on the
bridge and knows the area, was more skeptical, saying ``I wish they
would do something, but I'm not sure this will get it done.''
   Lawrence said 30 to 40 people have talked to him since Friday.

   Police couldn't put the collar on any
of the naked men who played a game of basketball next to a private
dormitory complex near the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.
   The X-rated game Thursday night would have been covered up had
it not been for a Granville Towers resident who called police. The
athletes peeled off running as police arrived, and a group of women
booed the cops for chasing the men away.
   A police report, filed Friday by Public Safety Officer Woody
Sands Minton, said:
   ``A group of about 10 nude males were playing basketball at
Granville. They had attracted the attention of 100 or so coeds with
varying focuses of attention. The suspects ran upon the approach of
the police car. The coeds booed. No suspects were caught.''
   The incident occurred about 10 p.m. Thursday at the basketball
court located near Granville Towers, three high-rise dormitories
just west of campus.
   Police didn't say when they thought the case would be wrapped up.

   A 10-month-old llama named Kosha has
become the first llama ever to get an artificial leg, and she seems
to be zipping around happily on the high-tech device, Colorado
State University veterinarians say.
   ``It's remarkable how easily she has adjusted,'' said Frank
Garry of CSU's Veterinary Teaching Hospital. ``She goes scooting
off when she has her artificial leg on. She enjoys having four legs
again.''
   Kosha lost much of her right front leg last December when she
got tangled in fence wire. She was part of a herd of 30 llamas
owned by Rudyard and Katharine Nelson, and their son, Jim, at a
farm near Kimball, Neb.
   In many cases when a large animal's limb is severely injured,
the animal has to be put to death because fitting artificial limbs
is so difficult. But veterinarians were able to replace the lower
part of Kosha's leg with materials developed for the space shuttle.
   Kosha was fitted with the device Wednesday. Officials say she
moved somewhat awkwardly at first, but soon was getting around with
few problems.
   The leg was designed to withstand almost all-day use without
causing sores and discomfort. It is expected to be weather
resistant and will allow natural movement.

   Afghan rebel leaders told 75,000
supporters Saturday they will fight on despite an accord to
withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Two nearby bomb explosions
killed five people.
   But Afghan President Najib, speaking in Kabul, warned the rebels
that they will face the ``iron will'' of his people after the
Soviet troops leave. His government controls about 75,000 troops.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan's acting foreign minister returned from
Geneva Saturday and predicted that Afghanistan's communist
government will fall quickly after the Soviet withdrawal.
   On Thursday in Geneva, the United States, Soviet Union, Pakistan
and Afghanistan signed an agreement to begin withdrawing an
estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan on May 15.
   Pakistan represented the guerrillas at the talks, but the
insurgents have vowed to oppose any agreement without their
participation. The Soviets have been helping the Marxist government
fight the Moslem insurgents since 1979.
   The guerrillas, known as Mujahedeen, are believed to number
about 200,000. They are based in Pakistan and receive support from
that country, as well as the United States, China, Iran, and other
nations.
   The two explosions near Peshawar Saturday also wounded at least
11 people. No one claimed responsibility, but Pakistani authorities
have blamed a wave of bombings in the past two years on the Afghan
secret police.
   In the village of Rajjar, about 40 miles north of Peshawar, four
people, including two women and a child, were killed and 10 wounded
when a 4-pound bomb went off in a waiting room of a bus station.
   One person was killed in another bomb explosion in Landi Kotal,
on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.
   The guerrilla leaders told the insurgents and refugees in a
stadium in this border city that they will fight until they topple
the Afghan government.
   Ahmed Shah, a guerrilla designated by the rebel alliance to head
an all-rebel interim government, stood in the 95-degree heat and
told the crowd his administration would soon move into Afghanistan.
He gave no deadline.
   ``We'll stay with you in Afghanistan, in the caves and snow, not
in Pakistan,'' he said.
   Despite the withdrawal agreement, the United States and Pakistan
have vowed to continue supplying arms to the rebels until the
Soviet Union ceases its aid to the Kabul government. The Kremlin
says it will continue supporting the Kabul government.
   Pakistan's acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani said he expected
the Afghan government to fall soon after the Soviets withdraw.
   ``I do not have any doubt about it. (The Kabul government) has
been rejected by the people of Afghanistan,'' he was quoted as
saying by the official Pakistani news agency APP.
   Noorani said Afghan guerrillas control more than 80 percent of
their country.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass quoted Najib as saying he
no longer needs Soviet support because the Geneva accord guarantees
his country's sovereignty. Pakistan and Afghanistan pledge not to
interfere in one another's affairs in the agreement.
   Najib said his government would need the help of Afghan refugees
to stave off the rebels. He called on the refugees, who number
about five million and live in Pakistan and Iran, to return home
and offered to help them set up armed units.
   Under the Geneva accord, the Soviet Union will pull half its
troops out of Afghanistan in three months and the rest after six
additional months.
   Many U.S. analysts believe Najib's government will collapse
during or after the Soviet withdrawal.

<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court decision upholding a child's
right to sue a school principal over corporal punishment could
drastically reduce use of the paddle, not so much because of the
courts but because of insurance companies, an expert says.
   As a result of the court's decision last month, said Temple
University psychology professor Irwin Hyman, ``more cases will come
to the courts and insurance companies will question the use of
corporal punishment in the schools and possibly raise rates for
schools which practice it.''
   The decision also means ``teachers will now be more vulnerable
to litigation'' because the existence of a basis for legal
challenge has been recognized, he said.
   Hyman is director of Temple's National Center for the Study of
Corporal Punishment and its Alternatives.
   On March 21, the Supreme Court let stand without comment a New
Mexico appeals court decision that said students could challenge
excessive corporal punishment in the federal courts on the basis of
their 14th Amendment right to due process.
   That case was brought in U.S. District Court five years ago. It
charged that Teresa Garcia, an elementary school student in
Penasco, N.M., was seriously beaten twice.
   Court documents said that in 1982, Teresa, then 9, was held
upside down by a teacher and beaten severely with a paddle. She was
bruised and scarred. She was beaten again the following year, the
suit said.
   The court ruled in the school's favor, but the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed the decision, saying that punishments
that are ``so grossly excessive as to be shocking to the conscience
violate substantive due process rights.''
   The Supreme Court upheld the appeals court, clearing the way for
the federal lawsuit to be tried on the issue of whether the
punishment given Teresa was indeed excessive.
   ``This case sets a precedent which other district courts will
look to'' and apply in other jurisdictions, said John Roesler, a
Santa Fe attorney who represented Teresa.
   Though the case could bring insurance company pressure to bear
on schoiol districts that practice paddling, Hyman said, there is
still tradition to contend with.
   ``There is a strong religious and historic precedent for
inflicting physical pain as a form of discipline in this country,''
he said. ``Even today, teachers believe that they should do to
children what was done to them.''
   Hyman said that a growing number of states have abolished
corporal punishment in the schools. There are now 14 states where
school paddling is illegal, Hyman said.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization's
nine factions all condemned the assassination Saturday of the
movement's deputy commander and vowed revenge, displaying unity
after years of fragmentation.
   Khalil al-Wazir and three of his bodyguards were killed by seven
armed men and a woman who burst into al-Wazir's home in suburban
Tunis, Tunisia.
   Among the Arab nations expressing outrage over the slayings were
Jordan, Iraq, Tunisia, Kuwait and Egypt _ all countries in which
al-Wazir, 52, had lived after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and Israeli
independence.
   Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates also
denounced the assassination.
   Syria, which had declared al-Wazir unwelcome following the
government's 1983 feud with PLO chief Yasser Arafat, said it would
receive al-Wazir's body if it was flown for burial in Damascus,
where his parents live.
   Hundreds of grieving Palestinians gathered outside the Damascus
residence of his 80-year-old father, Ibrahim al-Wazir, to offer
sympathy.
   The various PLO factions issued similarly worded statements
vowing revenge.
   ``We will avenge the blood of our martyr,'' said statements by
Saiqa, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine _ General
Command, and the Popular Struggle, the three Damascus-based groups
at odds with PLO chief Yasser Arafat's mainstream leadership.
Arafat is the head of Fatah, the largest group in the PLO, and
al-Wazir was Fatah's military commander.
   The Fatah-Uprising, a dissident faction that broke away from the
PLO in 1983, said in its statement: ``The crime aims at liquidating
the uprising and boosting the morale of the Zionist army,'' a
reference to the Palestinian rioting that has left more than 160
Arabs dead in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since Dec.8.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Arab Liberation Front
and the Palestine Liberation Front all praised Al-Wazir as ``a
national hero'' and vowed to strike at Israel.
   Fatah, which was founded by Arafat and al-Wazir, was the most
grieved and a spokesman for the group called the slain leader a
``national hero ... who has fallen victim of the Israeli bloodbath''
   ``A promise to the martyr: His mission will continue and his
blood will be avenged,'' Fatah said.
   The PLO blamed Israel's Mossad intelligence service for the
killing. There was no official reaction from the Israeli government.
   In Cairo, Butros Ghali, Egyptian minister of state for foreign
affairs, said: ``Egypt strongly condemns the assassination of Mr.
Khalil al-Wazir.
   Tunisian President Zine Al-abidine Ben Ali set up a special
committee to supervise a search for the killers.
   The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, allocated a
pension for Al-Wazir's widow and five children. The amount was not
given.

   Native Americans, who generally do
not vote as a matter of principle, must get involved in the
nation's political process in order to improve life on the
reservation, Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson said
Saturday.
   ``We want to reach out to them and urge them to vote,'' Jackson
said at a rally at an Indian museum. ``So many Native Americans
have simply been broken-hearted. They've been hurt so long they
feel a sense of betrayal. We have to get them involved.''
   Jackson urged Indians to join his Rainbow Coalition of
minorities and workers. He said racism and poverty experienced by
Indians was no different from that of blacks and other minorities.
   While some Native American communities have become involved in
American politics, New York is a stronghold for sovereign Indian
governments, such as the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy.
Most of the tribes in the confederacy believe that voting would
abrogate the treaties establishing their reservations as distinct
nations.
   Tribal governments are on guard against any incursion by
non-Indians and have often rejected economic development they could
not control. Partly as a result, the reservations have unusually
high unemployment rates.
   ``We all want the same things _ dignity, respect, and equal
opportunity,'' Jackson told about 800 people who gathered at the
Native American Center for the Living Arts on the banks of the
Niagara River near the Falls. Most of the crowd was black.
   Wanda Shoe, a director of the Native American center, said that
while most Indians are not even registered to vote, many identify
with Jackson as a candidate.
   ``He's the only one who has demonstrated any interest in us,''
Shoe said, adding that the candidate was causing many Indians to
re-evaluate themselves. She said she's not registered to vote, nor
are members of her family and most friends.
   ``We see what he is doing for black people,'' she said. ``It's
hard not to get excited by it.''
   Jackson spoke for almost an hour, calling for a war on drugs, an
increase in the minimum wage, better educational opportunites and
more money spent rebuilding roads and bridges.
   His supporters often interrupted him with chants of ``Win,
Jesse, Win''
   Following the speech, the directors of the center gave Jackson a
necklace and a printed shirt that read ``Remember Us, Native
Americans.''

<HEAD>Snow Across Northern New England, Rain In West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A slow-moving storm system Saturday dumped up to 11 inches of
snow heavy enough to pull down power lines in New England, while
rain was scattered across the West.
   Scattered light snow blew across parts of New York state and
northern and western Pennsylvania.
   In Maine, 11 inches of snow fell at Upton, on the New Hampshire
border, with more possible by Sunday morning. Southern sections of
the western Maine mountains received as much as 8 inches. In New
Hampshire, Dixville got 6 inches.
   The heavy, wet snow in Maine snapped tree branches and broke
power lines, leaving some 13,000 customers without electricity,
utilities officials said.
   ``A storm this time of the year is the worst nightmare for us
because it is always heavy and we can always count on these types
of problems,'' said Frank Chiaravalloti of Central Maine Power Co.
   Maine state police said they received reports of more than 100
traffic accidents, but no serious injuries were reported.
   The snow frustrated golfers and minor league baseball fans in
Maine, but it didn't stop the 22nd annual Kenduskeag Stream canoe
race. Several hundred people donned wet suits and lowered canoes,
kayaks and tire tubes into the stream at Bangor to race or lollygag
amid the snow.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from Arizona across New
Mexico into northwestern Texas, while rain and a few thunderstorms
extended across south-central Texas.
   In the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.01 inches of rain fell at
Tucumcari, N.M.
   Elsewhere in the West, showers were scattered over Nevada, Utah
and Arizona. Rain also fell along sections of the northern Pacific
Coast.
   Temperatures were only in the 30s and 40s from the upper Ohio
Valley across the northern and central Appalachians to the northern
half of the Atlantic Coast. Highs only in the 40s were common over
northern New Mexico and northern Arizona and in the mountains of
southern Utah and southern Colorado.
   Freeze warnings were posted overnight over the West Virginia's
Eastern Panhandle, western Maryland, northwestern Virginia,
southeastern Pennsylvania, and inland sections of southern New
Jersey. Frost warnings were issued for the rest of Maryland and
interior Virginia, as well as inland sections of the Carolinas.
   Record low temperatures were posted at Key West, Fla., with 59
degrees, and at Nashville, Tenn., with 28 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 30
degrees at Johnstown, Pa., and Limestone, Maine, to 83 in Florida
at Miami, Crestview and Fort Myers. The low for the day was 19
degrees at Marquette, Mich.
   For Sunday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
Colorado across Kansas, Oklahoma and northern and eastern Texas to
the lower half of the Mississippi Valley. Scattered showers were
forecast across the Rockies and the southwestern half of Texas.
Scattered rain was forecast along the northern half of the Pacific
Coast. More snow was forecast over northern Maine, with scattered
rain or snowshowers elsewhere across northern and central New
England and eastern New York state, and over Upper Michigan.
   Highs only in the 40s and 50s were predicted from the Dakotas to
Upper Michigan and northern Lower Michigan, and across New York
state and New England; in the 50s over Montana, southern Wyoming,
Colorado and the Arizona mountains; in the 80s over southern Texas
and the Florida Peninsula, and over parts of the central Gulf Coast
and the desert Southwest, and in the 60s or 70s over most of the
rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Former State Trooper Charged With Raping Two Girls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAPEER, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recently retired state trooper who used
to give speeches about child abuse has been charged with sexually
assaulting two girls while on the force, authorities said.
   Robert L. Beadle, 52, of Traverse City was arraigned earlier
this month on charges of criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping and
felony use of a firearm.
   He is accused of abducting and raping at gunpoint an 11-year-old
Lapeer girl in 1986 and a 13-year-old Lapeer girl in 1987. In each
case, the girl told police the assailant forced her off her bicycle
and into his car.
   Beadle worked in Traverse City from 1970 to 1985 and then at the
state police central office in Lansing until he retired in December.
   In Traverse City, he did school liaison and investigation of sex
crimes, said district commander Capt. John Cosgrove. His duties
included traveling the state giving speeches about child abuse.
   His most recent job involved training officers around in
computerized record-keeping, police said.
   Beadle, who was arraigned April 6, is free on $1,000 bond and
faces a preliminary examination Friday in Lapeer, a town east of
Fling and roughly 200 miles from Traverse City. If convicted, he
could face life imprisonment.
   Authorities said police first suspected Beadle last fall while
investigating a traffic accident in Traverse City that Beadle had
with an unmarked police car.
   While searching Beadle's car, officers found Beadle had police
artists' sketches of the suspect in the sexual assaults and
wondered why Beadle would have them. They also noticed a
resemblance to Beadle.
   Beadle was later identified by each victim in a photograph
lineup and then again in a physical lineup, said Lapeer County
Prosecutor Nick O. Holowka.
   A weapon described by the victims in both cases matched the type
of gun issued almost exclusively to state police officers,
authorities said.

   Sen. Roberto Ruffilli, a close friend and adviser of
Premier Ciriaco De Mita, was shot to death Saturday at his home in
northern Italy. An anonymous caller said Red Brigades terrorists
were responsible.
   Investigators told Italian news agencies the body of the
51-year-old Christian Democrat senator was found on a couch in his
living room at Forli, 40 miles southeast of Bologna. They said he
was shot in the back of the neck.
   A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said an anonymous
telephone caller to the Bologna office of the Rome newspaper La
Repubblica asserted responsibility on behalf of the Red Brigades.
   The spokesman quoted the caller as saying, ``We have killed
Senator Ruffilli, attacking at the heart of the state. Red Brigades
for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party.''
   President Francesco Cossiga said: ``Our institutions and all the
forces that are alive in the country will know how to act with
firmness for the defense of liberty and of right.
   ``The assassination of Sen. Roberto Ruffilli is a horrendous
crime against the most sacred of human values _ life. It is an
abominable attack on the parliamentary and representative
institutions which are the fulcrum of our democratic state.''
   Maurizio Laudi, a magistrate who has investigated the terrorist
group, was quoted by the news agency AGI as saying the Red Brigades
for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party is the most
dangerous and active group in what remains of the Red Brigades. He
said it also is the most difficult to penetrate.
   AGI said Ruffilli had received threatening phone calls in recent
days.
   He led the Christian Democrat committee on problems of the state
and was working with the premier on institutional reform. Ruffilli
also was on the parliamentary commission that investigated the P-2
Masonic Lodge scandal.
   Premier De Mita convened a special meeting Saturday night of
Interior Minister Antonio Gava and the chiefs of the Italy's police
forces.
   ``The criminal warning of the terrorists could not have been any
clearer,'' he said. ``It has the same clarity with which 10 years
ago through the person of Aldo Moro they aimed at his political
program.''
   Red Brigades terrorists kidnapped and killed Moro, a former
premier, in 1978.
   According to the news agency ANSA, investigators at Ruffilli's
home found the door open and no signs of forced entry. State-run
RAI television said the assassins fled on foot after the shooting
at about 1 p.m.
   In a dispatch quoting government sources it did not identify,
AGI said the car bombing that killed five people and wounded 17 at
a Naples club for U.S. military personnel Thursday night may have
inspired terrorists to kill Rufilli. An American servicewoman and
four Italians were killed in the blast.
   The murder of air force Gen. Licio Giorgieri in Rome on March
20, 1987, was the last terrorist act for which a branch of the Red
Brigades claimed responsibility.
   A month before that, the Red Brigades for the Formation of
Fighting Communist Party claimed responsibility for an armored car
robbery in Rome.
   In December 1981, Red Brigade terrorists disguised as plumbers
kidnapped U.S. Brig. Gen. James Dozier, who was with the NATO
command in Italy, from his home in Verona. He was rescued 42 days
later by a special police unit in Padua.
   In February 1984, terrorists in Rome fatally shot Leamon Hunt, a
U.S. diplomat and director-general of the Multinational Force and
Observers in Sinai. The Red Brigades claimed responsibility.

   A small plane taking seven
tourists from Finland on a sightseeing trip over the Grand Canyon
made a forced landing Saturday in a remote area high above the
Colorado River, officials said.
   The pilot of the Air Nevada plane and the passengers escaped
serious injury, according to the airline's director of operations,
Lew Kaplan.
   ``It was not a crash,'' Kaplan said from the company's Las
Vegas, Nev., headquarters. ``The airplane may have suffered some
minor damage, but it was not a crash.''
   The Cessna 207 was en route from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon
airport when it made a forced landing on high, flat ground above
the Colorado River in an area known as The Esplanade, said National
Park Service spokesman Chuck Lundy.
   Lundy said that the cause of the forced landing wasn't known and
that he hadn't been advised of the extent of damage to the
aircraft, but he added that he didn't think the aircraft could be
flown out of the landing site.
   The pilot and passengers were taken by helicopter to a medical
clinic here and were undergoing checkups, Lundy said. He said the
Grand Canyon National Park's rescue team had reported only minor
injuries, including one possible back injury.

   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., on Saturday said the
new U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms reduction treaty will cost the
taxpayers billions of dollars, contradicting a congressional report
that said the pact would save money.
   Helms, a leading opponent of the treaty which would eliminate
the two superpowers' medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe,
said the United States would have to strengthen its conventional
forces to counterbalance Soviet forces in Warsaw Pact nations.
   Thus, he estimated the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty
would cost taxpayers between $258 billion and $326 billion over the
13-year life of the pact.
   ``Most Americans are unaware of the price tag on this treaty
because the administration, particularly the Department of Defense,
has gone out of its way to cover up the taxpayer expense,'' Helms
said in a statement accompanying a draft of a report by the
Republican staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Helms, the ranking minority member of the committee, contradicts
a report, released April 6 by the General Accounting Office,
Congress' watchdog agency. It said the treaty would save about $1.7
billion through the fall of 1995.
   The GAO said the savings will come because the Pentagon will no
longer need to maintain its Pershing and ground-launched cruise
missile force in Western Europe. It said money will also be saved
on associated costs for military personnel, procurement and
construction of housing for military family members.
   However, Helms' committee report, using the GAO data and other
information from the Congressional Budget Office and the Army,
re-evaluated the costs and savings associated with the treaty.
   Department of Defense ``end-strengths will remain the same, or
even increase, since compensating steps will have to be taken to
repair NATO defenses in Europe once the INF systems have been
eliminated,'' the Republican report said.
   And, Helms said even if the United States does not boost its
convential forces in Europe, ``the treaty would still cost at least
$36.6 billion'' to scrap missiles, to guard against Soviet cheating
and to keep track of Soviet personnel assigned to monitor treaty
compliance.
   Helms said the Soviets will have costs too but said, ``in their
slave-labor economy, their expense will be insignificant when
compared with ours.''
   The treaty was endorsed last month in lopsided votes by both the
Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees and awaits a
vote in the full Senate.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has refused to
call it up for a vote until a dispute is resolved over whether the
treaty covers futuristic weapons such as lasers. The administration
has been pressing for ratification before the May 29-June 2
superpower summit meeting in Moscow.

   Palestinians blamed Israel Saturday for the
killing of PLO military commander Khalil al-Wazir, but an Israeli
expert on terrorism suggested he was assassinated in an internal
power struggle.
   It was certain the slaying will intensify the rioting in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Israeli soldiers killed
more than a dozen Arabs on Saturday in the highest single-day death
toll since anti-occupation violence began Dec. 8.
   Israel's government had no official reaction to the
assassination. Al-Wazir, whose code name is Abu Jihad, was killed
Saturday at his home in Tunis by commandos with machine guns.
   ``It is only natural that the PLO would blame Israel. They
always blame Israel,'' said Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Ariel Merari, a terrorism expert at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center For Strategic Studies, said tensions had been growing inside
the Palestine Liberation Organization between chairman Yasser
Arafat and al-Wazir, Arafat's military chief and No. 2 man in
Fatah, the PLO's largest branch.
   ``I would say that it's most likely an internal operation, an
operation that originated from within Fatah, and most likely was
carried out with the complicity, knowledge and perhaps at the
invitation of Yasser Arafat,'' said Merari.
   He said Arafat and al-Wazir had disagreed over Arafat's
appointment of commanders in south Lebanon, where the PLO has been
rebuilding its guerrilla force.
   But prominent Palestinians saw the killing as an attempt to stop
anti-occupation resistance in the occupied territories.
   ``I am certain the only party that will profit from the
assassination is Israel,'' said Hanna Siniora, editor of the
pro-PLO daily Al Fajr in Jerusalem.
   Siniora said al-Wazir was responsible for giving guidelines to
local Palestinian activists who led the four-month uprising in the
occupied lands.
   ``By planning the assassination, the thought was they can
contain and nip in the bud the present uprising in the occupied
territories,'' said Siniora. He noted that the slaying followed
mass arrests and other tough measures in the occupied areas.
   Palestinians said another indicator that Israel was involved was
the similarity between the assassination and Israel's April 10,
1973, commando raid in Beirut.
   Several senior PLO officials were shot to death, including Kamel
Adwan, al-Wazir's predecessor as operations chief of Fatah. The
commando team's leader was Amnon Lipkin, now head of Israeli
military intelligence.
   Israel carried out similar attacks:
   _ The Jan. 22, 1979, car bomb attack that killed Ali Hassan
Salameh, also known as Abu Hassan, Fatah's chief of intelligence,
who Israel believed helped mastermind the massacre of Israeli
athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.
   _ The Oct. 1, 1985, air raid on the PLO headquarters in Tunisia,
1,500 miles from Israel, in which 50 people were killed, including
an Arafat bodyguard.
   There also have been cases of Arab moderates slain by Arab
militants.
   _ Abu Nidal, leader of an extremist group that split from
Arafat's organization, claimed responsibility for the April 1983
assassination of Issam Sartawi, an adviser to Arafat who advocated
talks with Israel.
   _ On July 22, 1987, Palestinian cartoonist Ali Naji Awad Al
Adhami was shot outside the office of the Kuwati newspaper Al Qabas
in London. No one claimed responsibility, but investigators believe
members of one of the Arab groups he satirized killed him.
   Even though he believed the assassination was the work of
Palestinians, Merari said Israel had motives to strike at al-Wazir.
   ``I would say that Israel had very good reasons to do that.
Al-Wazir was personally involved in some of the more atrocious
terrorist acts against Israel,'' said Merari.
   Merari cited the March 1978 hijacking of a bus on the coastal
highway near Tel Aviv in which 35 Israelis were killed and the 1975
takeover of the Savoy Hotel in which 11 hostages were slain.
   As head of the so-called Western Sector military apparatus,
al-Wazir was also responsible for thousands of anti-Israeli attacks
in the occupied lands since 1967 when Israel seized the
territories, Merari said.
   Despite the violent protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Israeli military correspondent Zeev Schiff of the daily Haaretz
newspaper predicted the assassination would have a demoralizing
impact on the Palestinians.
   He said it also may touch off feuding among the PLO's eight main
factions.
   ``I estimate that there will be a power struggle, maybe a quiet
one, and a younger generation will emerge. It's a blow to Arafat,
and as a result the PLO will probably become a little more
extreme,'' said Schiff.

   A cub reporter kept an armed man on the
telephone for three hours and helped persuade him to surrender
Saturday after the man barricaded himself in his home to draw
attention to the drug problem.
   Raymond A. Garcia, 36, fired several shots in his home during
the seven-hour siege. No one was injured.
   Garcia had armed himelf with an AK-47 combat rifle, police said.
Neighbors were evacuated and police and agents from the state
Division of Criminal Investigation urged him to surrender by
telephone.
   Diana Reed, 23, who has worked for radio station KBUR for three
months, said she got a call from Garcia late Friday. ``I initially
had a reporter reaction,'' Miss Reed said. But she emerged as a key
player in resolving the standoff.
   ``I felt like it was all on my shoulders. The police and the DCI
kept telling me to stay on the line,'' she said.
   Garcia said that his 16-year-old son had a drug problem but that
police refused his request that they arrest the teen-ager and send
him to a drug dependency center, Miss Reed said.
   Garcia said he did not want to go to jail and threatened to
leave the house firing into the air so police would have to shoot
him, Miss Reed said.
   She advised him to surrender so police could answer his
complaints. He finally agreed on the condition that he not be taken
to jail.
   Garcia was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation,
said police Lt. David Wunnenberg. The man was charged with a
misdemeanor count of discharging a firearm, said Capt. Robert Sloan.
   ``I'm going to look into what he said,'' Miss Reed said. ``I
guess it takes arrest or charges filed by police to get children
into a drug rehabilitation program.''
   Police said four to six shots were fired during the siege but
were not aimed at anyone outside the house.

<DATELINE>NICEVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rocky Bayou Christian School says it
will let the Internal Revenue Service ``steal'' four years of
Social Security taxes it has refused to pay on grounds they violate
religious freedom.
   The non-denominational school of more than 300 students agreed
Friday to place nearly $90,600 in a bank account that the IRS can
then seize, said school director Bob Grete.
   ``Since we are not going to write a check for that amount,
they're going to steal it,'' Grete said. ``Neither side can
tolerate continuing this conflict.''
   IRS officials who met with Grete at the school Friday declined
comment.
   The school has refused to pay Social Security contributions for
its employees since 1984, claiming the levy amounts to a tax on God.
   The IRS withheld efforts to force collection until the U.S.
Supreme Court last month refused to hear an appeal in a similar
case involving the Bethel Baptist Church of Sellersville, Pa.
   ``We have an obligation to proclaim the authority of God. We're
being asked by human government to do what God would forbid,''
Grete said. ``We can't pay the tax. Sin is sin regardless of
whether the Supreme Court will give us a hearing or not.''

<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trustee for the financially troubled
PTL ministry says he will try to save its religious activities,
even if it means selling its Heritage USA theme park.
   ``PTL is something much more important than a water park or a
hotel,'' David Clark said Friday. ``The heart of PTL must be the
ministry.''
   During a hearing Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds,
who extended the deadline for PTL to present a bankruptcy
reorganization plan by two weeks to May 16, said it ``looks like
the end of the road'' for the ministry.
   PTL officials told Reynolds at the hearing in Greensboro, N.C.,
that they couldn't raise the $5.7 million needed by the previous
deadline of May 2.
   Reynolds ordered Clark to present a plan that would enable the
ministry built by Jim and Tammy Bakker to sell whatever is
necessary while continuing to operate.
   ``It's definitely a liquidation,'' Reynolds said. ``It's just a
matter of how orderly a liquidation.''
   The Internal Revenue Service is seeking more than $55 million in
back taxes and opposes PTL's plan to qualify as a tax-exempt
organization.
   PTL plans to sell 1,700 undeveloped acres it owns on the South
Carolina-North Carolina border and a small attraction at Heritage
USA in Fort Mill called Farmland USA.
   Clark said other assets may have to be sold to preserve the
ministry's religious activities, including the daily ``PTL Club''
show and the satellite TV network.
   He told Reynolds the $10 million water park at Heritage USA will
not open this year for lack of money.
   Clark also told the judge that people who once financed the
ministry aren't contributing any more. ``We had a moral bankruptcy
in the ministry that led to a financial bankruptcy,'' he said.
   He said the ministry laid off about 125 employees Friday,
leaving the full-time payroll at about 685. When Clark arrived at
PTL on Nov. 1, the ministry had about 1,100 employees.
   Clark said representatives of ``a major U.S. financial
institution'' will meet next week with PTL officials to discuss a
possible long-term loan of $45 million.
   But Reynolds was skeptical. ``I don't know who would loan you
money,'' the judge said.
   The financial troubles renewed talk that Bakker, who stepped
down last year in a sex and hush-money scandal, may return.
   ``The second that Clark fails, Jim will be back,'' said Inez
Brown, vice president of the Bring Bakker Back Club, which has been
urging supporters to withhold contributions until Bakker returns.

   Seven masked commandos burst into the home
of PLO military chief Khalil al-Wazir early Saturday and opened
fire with submachine guns, killing him, two bodyguards and a
gardener.
   Government and PLO officials said al-Wazir fired back with a
revolver but his body was riddled by about 170 bullets. PLO sources
in Cyprus and Tunisia said a second group of commandos provided
cover outside the building, but those reports were not confirmed.
   Leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization blamed Israel
for the killings in suburban Tunis. Palestinians protesting the
slaying rioted in the Israeli-occupied territories and Israeli
soldiers killed more than a dozen Arabs in the worst single-day
toll since violence against the occupation began Dec. 8.
   Al-Wazir, 52, also was called Abu Jihad (Father of Holy War). He
was the most senior Palestinian official assassinated since the
Fatah, the largest guerrilla group in the PLO, was founded 1964.
   He was PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's closest aide, a member of
the Executive Committee and the No. 2 man after Arafat in Fatah. He
led Fatah's troops, the main PLO force, and supervised military
operations inside the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   The PLO said the assassination team, which included a woman,
fired about 170 bullets into al-Wazir's body. The commandos
escaped, and Tunisian sources said three vehicles possibly used in
the early morning attack were found on a beach about 25 miles north
of Tunis.
   Israel gave no official reaction to the killings, and U.S.
officials refused to comment on whether the Israelis were
responsible.
   Arafat, who was in Bahrain at the time, was ``quite shocked and
angered,'' said a PLO source there, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Arafat went later to Saudi Arabia and then on to Tunis.
   A special investigation commission formed by President Zine
el-Abidine ben Ali of Tunisia said in a preliminary report Saturday
night a commando group ``armed with silenced submachine guns and
pistols, made up of seven members, including a woman, attacked the
residence of Abu Jihad at 1:30 a.m.''
   It said the killers fired ``several bursts at the Palestinian
leader, his two bodyguards ... and a Tunisian gardener'' and
al-Wazir responded ``using his personal revolver before being hit
in different parts of his body.''
   ``The commandos immediately left on the road to the forest of
Raoued, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Tunis aboard three
vehicles, a Peugeot 305 and two Volkswagen minibuses, found
abandoned by their occupants Saturday at dawn,'' the report said.
   It said the investigation indicated the vehicles had ``been
rented under false identities.''
   Palestinian officials vowed to intensify the guerrilla war
against Israel and the uprising of Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza.
   The PLO is an umbrella group for eight Palestinian factions,
including Fatah. Three PLO groups and a guerrilla organization
outside it challenge Arafat's loyalists.
   A PLO spokesman in Tunis said the attack was carried out by the
``Israeli terrorists of Mossad (the secret service) and their
American backers who are determined to liquidate our people.''
   Bassam Abu Sharif, a top Arafat adviser, said in a telephone
interview: ``Contrary to what the Israeli government thinks, the
murder of Abu Jihad will only increase our determination, and we
shall upgrade both the uprising and military operations to avenge
this act of terrorism.''
   PLO officials said al-Wazir was in the study of his house
reading when the attackers drove up, killed a Tunisian bodyguard in
a car outside, then burst into the house and killed a Palestinian
bodyguard and a gardener.
   ``They then broke into Abu Jihad's study,'' said a PLO spokesman
who refused to give his name. ``Everything happened within seconds.
He had drawn his pistol to defend himself, but they mowed him
down.''
   Al-Wazir's wife, Intisar, his daughter Hanan, 14, and son Nidal,
2, the youngest of his five children, were in the house at the time
but were unhurt.
   Palestinian officials said al-Wazir's wife told Tunisian
authorities that the attackers were masked, dressed in military
fatigues and armed with silenced weapons.
   The area around al-Wazir's home was sealed off by Tunisian
security forces. Police set up roadblocks and were checking
identities throughout the area. All routes out of the country were
being watched.
   Saturday's killing was the second strike at the PLO on Tunisian
territory since the group moved its headquarters there after it was
driven from Lebanon by the invasion of the Israeli army in 1982.
   On Oct. 1, 1985, Israeli jets bombed PLO headquarters at Tunis,
killing about 80 Palestinians and 20 Tunisians and injuring at
least 100 other people.

   A federal grand jury has indicted a couple on
charges of taking more than 180 Holiday Inns in 20 states to the
cleaners for more than $6,000.
   Keith W. Froemming and Joan M. Atwell were indicted on seven
counts of conspiracy, mail fraud and bank fraud.
   The indictment alleged that Froemming wrote managers of each
hotel that coffee had been spilled on his wife's suede skirt when
the couple visited the hotel's restaurant during a business trip.
   Froemming claimed the staff told him to send the cleaning bill,
and he enclosed a bill for $30.16, the indictment said.
   The ploy, begun around March 1, apparently worked, the
indictment said. About 200 checks totaling more than $6,000 were
sent to a private post office box in Vail in March, authorities
said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government acted improperly when it
denied the widow of former Chilean president Salvador Allende a
visa in 1983 by saying the speeches she planned to give were a
potential threat to foreign policy, a federal appeals court has
ruled.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court
ruling that denying a visa to Hortensia Allende violated the 1952
Immigration and Nationality Act.
   But the court also noted that after the lawsuit was filed, the
government approved a multiple entry visa for Mrs. Allende valid
through the end of 1987 and has said it presumably would approve a
visa application in 1988.
   Mrs. Allende has visited the United States several times under
the visa, said one of her attorneys, Allan Rosenberg.
   The court rejected the Reagan administration's argument that
Mrs. Allende's presence would cause ``general harm to foreign
policy.''
   ``The government may not exclude Allende on the bare assertion
that her presence in the United States at any given time may
prejudice foreign policy interests,'' the court said in a decision
Wednesday upholding a U.S. District Court ruling last year.
   Mrs. Allende had planned to address several groups in California
that had invited her to speak on women's and human rights issues.
Her husband, Salvador Allende, was slain during a 1973 coup that
overthrew him and his Marxist government.
   The case was brought by the National Emergency Civil Liberties
Committee, the Boston Area Council on Latin America, the Northern
California Ecumenical Council and four Massachusetts university
professors who had invited Mrs. Allende to speak.
   In a statement, attorneys for the civil liberties organization
said the ruling ``is of historic significance because of the clear
ruling that Mrs. Allende was denied a visa because of the content
of her intended speech and the court's rejection of the
government's right to do so.''

   AIDS cases reported among intravenous drug users
outnumbered cases among homosexuals and bisexuals for the first
time during the first three months of 1988, the city Health
Department reported Saturday.
   ``It has become clear that the gay community has made effective
progress in reducing the spread of new infection, unlike the IV
drug-using population, where the virus continues to spread
virtually unabated,'' said Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, health
commissioner.
   Nonetheless, he said, ``the toll exacted by AIDS among gay men
will continue to increase, as those who were infected in the early
and mid-1980s become sick.''
   A preliminary report shows there were 386 new AIDS cases
reported among intravenous drug users and 385 cases among
homosexual and bisexual men between Jan. 1 and March 11 in New York
City.
   Gay men who used intravenous drugs were counted only in the gay
statistical category, said department spokesman Marvin Bogner.
   As of March 11, the city had a total of 13,839 AIDS patients. Of
the 13,554 adults, 7,320 had male-to-male sexual contact; 4,343
used IV drugs, and 639 had both risks, the Health Department said.

   Thirteen demonstrators were arrested
Saturday after chaining themselves to the gate of a plant that
manufactures tear gas being used by Israeli soldiers against
protesting Arabs, police said.
   Police said 200 to 300 demonstrators, most of whom arrived by
bus from Washington, D.C., West Virginia and Ohio, marched 2{ miles
from a park to the Federal Laboratories Inc. plant to ask for an
end to the manufacture of the tear gas canisters.
   Thirteen chained themselves to the gate until State Police
arrived with bolt cutters. They were charged with criminal
trespass. Most posted bail.
   The national American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has

<HEAD>North Dakota Democrats Pick Delegates to National Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF MEYER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   North Dakota Democrats settled on a largely
uncommitted slate of national convention delegates, but Jesse
Jackson supporters said Saturday they considered it a victory to
win two delegates in this rural, predominantly white state.
   Three of the 15 delegates picked at the party's state convention
are pledged to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, and 10 are
uncommitted.
   Jackson barely qualified for any national delegates at all,
receiving support from 16 percent of the state convention
delegates. Under Democratic Party rules, a candidate must receive
at least 15 percent of the available support to claim any national
convention delegates.
   Dukakis received support from 25 percent of the state convention
delegates, while the uncommitted group accounted for 59 percent of
the state convention delegates.
   ``We feel it's a very good showing for Jesse in a state that
does not have many blacks,'' said Tom Disselhorst, state
co-chairman for the Jackson campaign.
   He said he hoped that Jackson's showing ``sends a message to New
York that Jesse can do well in conservative, predominantly white
states.''
   Nearly 96 percent of North Dakota's population is white.
   North Dakota Democrats began their process last month with
precinct caucuses, in which Dukakis appeared to have enough
strength to claim as many as five national convention delegates. If
those results had been followed at the state convention, Jackson
would have received three delegates and seven would have been
uncommitted.
   North Dakotans, however, tend to focus on issues rather than
candidates, and more than half of those who are counted as
uncommitted actually were supporting issues related to labor and
agriculture
   Ellen Austin, state coordinator of the Dukakis campaign, said
she expected her candidate to attract a number of uncommitted
delegates.
   Six state party leaders, including Gov. George Sinner and Rep.
Byron Dorgan, automatically receive seats as delegates to the
national convention.
   Sinner is uncommitted, and Dorgan, a former supporter of Rep.
Richard Gephardt, is backing Dukakis.

<BYLINE>Celebrants Dance Again At Warsaw's Last Synagogue
^By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last synagogue in Warsaw was filled
Saturday with hundreds of young Jews who prayed, danced and sang
the Israeli national anthem to mark the Jewish ghetto uprising
against Nazi occupation troops.
   An overflow crowd of 1,000 people packed the rebuilt Nozyk
Synagogue, where the weekly Saturday morning services usually are
attended by only several dozen Polish Jews, most of whom are
elderly.
   There are no rabbis still in Poland, but several from Israel,
the United States, Canada and England led the Sabbath services on
Saturday.
   Several thousand Jews from around the world have come to Poland
to mark the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in
which poorly armed insurgents fought a heroic but doomed battle to
resist the final Nazi drive to liquidate the 70,000 Jews left in
the ghetto.
   Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon, who is heading the
official Israeli delegation for the anniversary observances, gave
an emotional speech to the worshipers, speaking in Hebrew.
   ``I want the Hebrew language to be heard here, the language of
the resurrection of the Jewish people,'' said Navon, who later
translated his remarks into English.
   Navon, the highest-ranking Israeli official ever to visit this
communist country, said ``nothing is left'' of Warsaw's
once-vibrant Jewish community.
   Before the 1939 Nazi invasion, Warsaw was home to about 380,000
Jews, or 30 percent of the city's population. Most died of hunger,
disease or in the gas chambers of Nazi death camps.
   ``There are no remains of the ghetto and of the revolt,'' said
Navon. ``For all those who survive there is only one way _ back to
Zion.''
   Afterwards, several hundred young Jews from Israel and other
countries sang Hebrew songs and joined hands to dance inside and in
front of the synagogue, which was destroyed by the Nazis and
reopened in April 1983 during observances of the 40th anniversary
of the ghetto uprising.
   They also sang ``The Hope,'' the Israeli national anthem.
   ``I'm very excited,'' said 15-year-old Tsul Shafil of Tel Aviv.
``I think it is very important for us to come because the blood is
here and we must be here to say that Israel is living.''
   Stanley Shapiro of Venice, Calif., a member of a U.S.-based
committee set up to preserve sites of the Holocaust in Poland, said
watching the young Jews dancing at the synagogue was an emotional
experience.
   ``I think it's a reaffirmation of the vitality of the Jewish
people,'' he said. ``It shows that the Jewish people remember and
do not forget.''

<TEXT>
   The quietest political election campaign in
America is being fought in the U.S. Senate.
   No bands, banners or bumper stickers for these candidates for
one of the nation's most powerful offices. No glad-handing media
events staged for television; indeed, news coverage is discouraged.
   It's the ultimate insider election.
   The winner becomes the Democratic leader of the Senate, and if
the party keeps its hold in the November elections, the winning
candidate will become Senate majority leader.
   The campaign, which has unofficially been under way for more
than a year, began in earnest shortly before 2:30 p.m. last Tuesday
when Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia announced he would not seek
re-election as majority leader.
   Within minutes, three senators let the press know they wanted
the job. Others were said to have sniffed the winds, but were
quietly discouraged by fellow Democrats.
   Because the three who are running didn't call any formal news
conferences, and because they won't even want to be seen as
campaigning, brief profiles are in order:
   _Sen. Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii. Inouye is 63, has served five
terms in the Senate and is secretary of the Democratic caucus, the
No. 3 position in the Senate Democratic leadership. Inouye was
handed a plum last year when he was named chairman of the Select
Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan
Opposition _ the man who ran the Senate's summer-long Iran-Contra
hearings.
   Inouye rates his chances as ``very good'' despite some quiet
party criticism last year that he allowed Lt. Col. Oliver L. North
to steal the show. Disclosure of his maneuvering to get money for
religious schools in France included in a budget bill last December
also hurt, but Inouye has a long record of distinguished service.
   In 1973, he gained prominence as a member of the Watergate
investigating committee. During World War II, he lost his right arm
fighting in Italy. He holds the Distinguished Service Cross, the
nation's second highest military decoration.
   _Sen. George J. Mitchell of Maine. At 54, Mitchell is the
youngest of the three declared candidates, a federal court judge
who resigned his lifetime appointment to the bench in 1979 to
accept an appointment to the Senate. He won on his own in 1982, and
is running again this year.
   Mitchell is considered by some the favorite in the race for
Democratic leader, although it's a contest with a tradition of
surprises. (Byrd won the job in 1977 when Hubert Humphrey conceded
defeat a week before the vote).
   Mitchell gained favor in 1986 as chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, a year the party re-claimed its
majority in the Senate. Consequently, Mitchell was named to the
prestigious Iran-Contra committee and was given the honorary
position of deputy president pro tempore of the Senate.
   _Sen. J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana. Johnston is 55, has been
in the Senate since 1972 and is midway through his third term,
serving as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
   Johnston tried to unseat Byrd for the job in 1986 but conceded
defeat a week before the election. He remains popular with fellow
Southern and oil-state Democrats and says he's ``very encouraged''
by the support he counts this time around.
   Byrd voluntarily stepped down after 10 years in the office,
maintaining he had the votes to keep the job. But, he said, he
would rather devote himself to helping poverty-ridden West
Virginia, using his seniority to become chairman of Appropriations
Committee and president pro tempore of the Senate. First, of
course, he must win re-election in November, and the Democrats must
retain control of the Senate, which they now hold by a 54-46 margin.
   Each candidate offers Democrats a change of image.
   Byrd, who used his knowledge of the Senate and its rules and his
collection of IOUs to originally gain the job, is now perceived by
some party leaders as unsuited to be chief spokesman in the age of
televised Senate proceedings.
   A Washington Post editorial said after his announcement that
Byrd was more the ``attentive stationmaster than a smooth front man
for his party and articulator of its views.''
   He also was a stickler for Senate rules, procedure and historic
custom. His sometimes ponderous leadership style did little to
alleviate the ``quality of life'' issue that left younger senators
fretting and chafing as the Senate sat idle through hours of
``quorum calls'' only to get down to business at midnight.
   It was that ``quality of life'' issue that helped Sen. Dan
Evans, R-Wash., decide against re-election this year. Those who
remain complain darkly that if that quality keeps declining, so
will the quality of future senators.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., says Inouye, Mitchell and Johnston
already have been to see him seeking his vote, and all three
``voiced concern about the quality-of-life issue around here.''
   Dixon said the candidates have probably each visited most of the
other voters, too. With only 53 men and one woman eligible to vote,
the campaign is personal, ``very personal.''
   The Democrats won't elect their leader until after the November
elections.
   Should the Democrats keep control, they'll be electing not just
a party leader, but the senator who controls the floor, deciding
when _ or even if _ to call up bills for Senate action.
   The role of leader also could be shaped by the presidential
election. If the Democrats win both the White House and the Senate,
Democrats may want a leader who can forcefully move the party's
agenda through Congress. If they lose the White House, they could
turn more to someone who can speak eloquently for the loyal
opposition.
   ``But far more important factors are observations of how able
(the candidate is) to work with the process and his colleagues,''
said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.

   Supporters of rival candidates battled
at political rallies throughout South Korea during campaigning
Saturday for legislative elections.
   It was the first day of ``joint'' rallies attended by opposing
candidates in the April 26 balloting.
   Police said about 12 people were injured in fights between
supporters of governing party candidates and opposition parties in
Seoul and other cities.
   In central Seoul, a woman believed to be a governing party
worker was injured when she was hit by an object thrown during a
rally that included opposition speakers.
   Another planned joint rally in Seoul was canceled because of
clashes.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, a dozen students attacked a
police station with rocks and firebombs. No injuries were reported.
   Also in Kwangju, hundreds of governing and opposition supporters
fought during a joint rally, hurling rocks and bottles, and a few
people were injured, police said.
   Other cities were clashes were reported included Chunchun,
Pusan, Inchon and Chonju.
   At stake in the elections are 299 National Assembly seats, of
which 224 are to be filled by direct popular vote with the
remaining 75 seats allocated to parties according to their share of
the overall vote.
   President Roh Tae-woo's Democratic Justice Party is seeking a
majority in the one-house legislature. Divisions among opposition
parties are expected to give the governing party the advantage.
   Roh won the presidency in balloting on Dec. 16 with just 36.6
percent of the vote. Main opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim
Dae-jung split most of the remaining vote.
   In a rare show of unity, four opposition parties announced a
joint petition drive Saturday to urge the government to investigate
former President Chun Doo-hwan and his wife on corruption charges.
   The nation's two main opposition groups, the Reunification
Democratic Party and the Party for Peace and Democracy, and two
minor opposition parties said they hope to collect 1 million
signatures.
   Chun's brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, is awaiting trial on charges of
embezzlement, influence peddling and extortion while he was head of
the semi-official Saemaul Undong, or New Community, development
movement.
   Last week, ex-President Chun resigned as chairman of the
Advisory Council of State Elders, which advises the president on
national affairs, and as honorary chairman of the Democratic
Justice Party. He said he resigned because he had failed to prevent
his brother from acting improperly.

   American evangelist Billy Graham, making his
first visit to China, met Saturday with Premier Li Peng in
Zhongnanhai, a walled compound in central Beijing where many of the
Communist Party's top leaders reside.
   ``We don't have the same god but that doesn't matter,'' Li said
in opening remarks. ``It doesn't prevent us from having a good talk
together.''
   Graham said his wife Ruth was born in China, the daughter of
missionaries, and lived in China until she was 17. He said they
wanted to be good ambassadors for both Chinese and Americans.
   Also attending the meeting was Ren Wuzhi, head of the Religious
Affairs Bureau, and Bishop K.H. Ding, president of the China
Christian Council.
   Graham, 69, who has spoken at evangelical meetings in more than
60 countries, is to deliver a sermon to mainland Chinese for the
first time Sunday, at a Protestant church in Beijing.
   China has 4,000 established churches under the state-sanctioned
three-self movement of ``self-government, self-support and
self-propagation.''
   Religious worship is no longer suppressed as it was during the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution, but proselytizing is banned and
Catholics have been imprisoned for refusing to break ties with the
Vatican.
   According to official estimates there are about 4 million
Protestants and more than 3 million Catholics in China. There may
be others who stay away from the state-approved churches.
   Graham, a Southern Baptist, has met with students at Beijing
University and members of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
   Saturday morning Graham, his wife and their son Franklin visited
the Temple of Heaven, where China's emperors used to pray for good
harvests.
   The official English-language China Daily, in a report Saturday
on Graham's visit, quoting him as saying, ``I am impressed with the
fact that several thousand churches have reopened ... after the
decade of the Cultural Revolution.''
   Graham told the newspaper that Beijing University students ``had
a tremendous religious awareness'' and they talked about
Confucianism, Taoism and Islam as well as Christianity.
   He was asked if had converted any of the students and the paper
reported Graham laughed and said, ``I didn't attempt that. I was
just answering their questions.''

   China's most famous smoker, senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, ran up against the Philippines' most famous anti-smoking
advocate, President Corazon Aquino, at the Great Hall of the People
on Saturday.
   ``Mind if I smoke?'' the 83-year-old Deng asked at the start of
their talks.
   ``I cannot say no to you because I am not the leader of this
country,'' Mrs. Aquino responded as Deng lit up. ``But in the
Philippines for Cabinet meetings, no smoking'' is allowed, she
added.
   Deng, laughing, recalled that at the recent National People's
Congress session he had started smoking and ``a deputy to the
congress handed over a piece of paper criticizing my smoking. I
violated the regulations of the NPC so I stopped.''
   Deng continued smoking after Mrs. Aquino made her commments.
   Deng has acknowledged in the past that smoking and spitting are
his two most serious vices. He is believed to chain-smoke Panda
cigarettes, a high-quality brand unavailable to most Chinese.
   Public health officials in China only recently have begun to
warn the nation's 300 million smokers, including two-thirds of
Chinese men over the age of 15, of the dangers of smoking. Some
efforts have been made to ban smoking in train stations and other
public places.
   Mrs. Aquino, who reportedly suffers from asthma, has imposed
strict prohibitions on smoking in her home as well as at her
Cabinet meetings.

   Workers throughout the Soviet Union participated
Saturday in the 69th annual subbotnik _ a day of unpaid labor
donated to the communist state.
   In Moscow, workers bustled about their jobs on a sunny but cold
spring day.
   The official Tass news agency said nearly 150 million people
turned out for the subbotnik that would provide millons of rubles
for building clinics, hospitals, schools, libraries, clubs and
stadiums. The oncologic and cardiologic centers in Moscow were
built with subbotnik funds, according to Tass.
   Subbotniks have become a part of Soviet life since the first one
in April 1919 when fifteen workers at a Moscow railway depot
voluntarily repaired a steam locomotive without additional pay. A
few days later, after word had spread of the deed, many Moscow
workers put in a day at their usual jobs without pay.
   Vladimir I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, joined in the
expanded subbotnik in 1919. The annual subbotniks now are held on a
Saturday close to Lenin's birthdate of April 22, 1870.
   But subbotniks also can be held to commemorate other dates, such
as the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet state in 1917 and
the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.
   There have been complaints about bosses who forced unpaid work
days on workers.
   The Literaturnaya Gazeta in December said a Volgograd woman was
asked to resign from her job at a wood processing plant after she
wrote a letter to a newspaper saying subbotniks sometimes were
imposed rather than being a voluntary contribution to the public
good.
   Tass reported, also in December, that a group of factory
employees objected to being ordered into the plant on Saturdays to
make up for production problems during the week. The report said
that over a one-year period, workers were told to report for work
on 20 Saturdays.

   Part-time Maine resident George Bush won
all 22 of the state's national convention delegates, one of whom is
his daughter, as the Republicans wound up their state convention on
Saturday.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson, who had once hoped
to stage an upset in Maine's February caucuses, succeeded only in
winning two alternates to the Republican National Convention.
   The delegates elected Saturday include Bush's daughter, Dorothy
Bush-LeBlond, who lives in Cape Elizabeth; Gov. John R. McKernan
Jr., and his mother, Barbara, who lives in Bangor.
   Bush backers had acknowledged a possibility that some Robertson
allies might infiltrate the Maine delegation, but the Bush camp
said it would not work actively to stop the Robertson forces.
   ``There's a spirit here not to cut everything all-out,'' said
Linwood Palmer of Nobleboro, a member of Bush's executive committee
who was ultimately elected as a national delegate.
   ``We're just going to let it go,'' McKernan said mid-way through
the delegate elections. ``If it were going to be a race, we'd play
hardball.''
   More than 1,000 people gathered in the Bangor Auditorium for the
convention, where the outcome of the delegate elections was never
seriously in question. Most of the speech-making amounted to an
advance celebration of the nomination Bush is expected to win in
New Orleans in August.
   McKernan, who has been Bush's most prominent Maine booster,
hailed him as ``the most qualified person ever to seek the
presidency.''
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, who previously professed neutrality
in the presidential race, said, ``No one, in my judgment, comes
better prepared to assume the reins of leadership in this country
than George Bush.''

   Mikhail Gorbachev's chief spokesman poked fun
Saturday at former White House spokesman Larry Speakes' admission
that he concoted quotes for President Reagan.
   Asked about his job during a news conference at the University
of Colorado, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said: ``One difference is I don't put my own words in someone
else's mouth.''
   Gerasimov, who later gave a lecture at the university, also
called the war in Afghanistan ``a bleeding wound, and we're very
happy to have this wound heal'' by withdrawing Soviet troops.
   On Thursday, the Soviet Union, the United States, Pakistan and
Afghanistan signed an agreement calling for Soviet troops to begin
leaving Afghanistan on May 15.
   Gerasimov said Soviet intentions ``to help the revolution'' in
Afghanistan may have failed because ``maybe this revolution does
not have enough local roots to be a real socialist revolution.
Maybe they were too early.''
   Speakes, in his upcoming book, ``Speaking Out,'' said he twice
attributed remarks to Reagan that the president never said.
   In one instance, Speakes said he quoted Reagan as telling
Gorbachev during their 1985 Geneva summit meeting, ``There is much
that divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we
are talking here together.''

   Gang violence has disrupted the easygoing
life of this sunny city, where gang-related killings last year
claimed more than four times the 1987 death toll in Northern
Ireland's sectarian bloodshed.
   ``I can't even walk to the store at night,'' complains John
Stewart, 69, a retired custodian who ives near one of the many
houses used as drug dens in south-central Los Angeles.
   ``It's hell around here. It's crazy,'' said Stewart, whose
poodle Tiffy was killed by a stray bullet two years ago.
   Many residents of the nation's second-largest city live in fear
of gunmen who often are not men at all but rather children with
guns.
   The ``good old days of tire irons and chains are over,'' laments
Ira Reiner, district attorney for Los Angeles County.
   Today's young thugs prefer weapons such as Uzi submachine guns
and Chinese copies of the Soviet AK-47 assault rifle.
   ``This isn't `West Side Story,''' Reiner said, referring to the
musical about New York City gangs.
   ``West Side Story'' featured a love story and fights staged like
dances. A new movie called ``Colors,'' starring Robert Duvall and
Sean Penn, has heightened worries about the Los Angeles violence
because it depicts on film the real rivalry between the city's
biggest gangs, the Bloods and the Crips.
   Minor scuffles at two theaters in the Los Angeles area marred
the opening of ``Colors'' on Friday and resulted in 13 arrests, but
predictions that the movie would incite violence failed to
materialize as police provided heavy security at sold-out theaters.
   Police and community service experts estimate between 70,000 to
80,000 young people belong to about 600 gangs across Los Angeles.
   Last year, 387 people were slain by this city's baby gangsters
who battle each other over drug profits, or kill on a dare or over
taunts that become battle cries.
   During the same period, the ``troubles'' in Northern Ireland
claimed 93 lives.
   There have been at least 89 deaths in Los Angeles County this
year, many of them innocent bystanders.
   ``There are mostly revenge killings. Unfortunately they aren't
very selective on these revenge killings,'' said police Lt. Fred
Nixon.
   The gang killers are children of poverty and come from the
city's toughest streets, in the mostly black neighborhoods south of
downtown or the largely Hispanic districts on the city's east side.
   Before the 1980s, said police Cmdr. Lorne Kramer, most gangs
were Hispanic. Their violence was sporadic and related to
territorial disputes and machismo.
   This changed in the '80s with the emergence of black gangs and
drug profits.
   The scene was further transformed by the emergence of ``rock''
or ``crack'' cocaine, a crystalline form of the drug that is
portable and affordable even in the city's poorer neighborhoods.
   Tension over gang killings has been at an all-time high in
recent weeks, with Police Chief Daryl Gates deploying 1,000
officers at a time to intimidate gangs and make mass arrests of
suspected gangsters.
   Public awareness rose after violence moved from the inner city
to upscale neighborhoods. A young woman was slain on Jan. 30 in
gang crossfire in the fashionable Westwood theater district near
the University of California at Los Angeles.
   That was followed by a Good Friday gang attack that killed one
person and wounded a dozen others.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
complains that too many innocent people are being rounded up in the
sweeps.
   Arrests for littering, blocking sidewalks, jaywalking and
spitting have been common since the sweeps started in March, said
Raymond Johnson, branch president for the NAACP.
   American Civil Liberties Union attorney Carol Sobel also said,
``We are troubled'' and that the organization is examining possible
legal action.
   On a recent weekend, Stewart's neighborhood resembled a combat
zone when police raided a cocaine den and were greeted by shotgun
blasts.
   Afterward, police units that surrounded the house roared off on
another call, sirens blaring in the night, while a police
helicopter thundered overhead.
   ``It's like this every weekend now,'' Stewart said.
   Los Angeles is not the only city in the nation where dangerous
gangs are active. Police in Jackson, Miss., were seeking several
gang members in connection with a shootout that injured at least
five youths in a crowd of about 200 students apparently celebrating
senior skip day Friday.
   Officer Ronnie Thrash said the shooting at Old Trace Park in
Madison County apparently involved two rival gangs.
   And in Trenton, N.J., police say they are increasing their
presence in a tough, crime-ridden neighborhood blocks from the
Statehouse while they investigate gang-related shootings and an
allegedly drug-related death early last week.
   ``It's going to be a long, hot summer,'' said city police Sgt.
Robert Orlowski.

   A Venezuelan marine sergeant was
killed and two other soldiers were wounded when Colombian
guerrillas fired on their barge on on the Arauca River, the Defense
Ministry said Saturday.
   Colombians fired on another Venezuelan vessel in the same area
two hours later but there were no casualties, the ministry said in
a statement.
   The death is the first this year of a Venezuelan soldier in a
border clash with Colombians.
   The fatal attack occurred when the dredging barge was clearing a
section of the river about 360 miles southwest of Caracas. The
river forms part of the border between the two countries.
   ``A group of presumed Colombian common criminals in a canoe .. .
opened fire suddenly upon the dredge, mortally wounding Sgt. Luis
Malave Cordoba and inflicting minor wounds on two other marine
infantrymen,'' the ministry said.
   The ministry did not say if the Venezuelans returned fire or if
there were Colombian casualties.
   Gen. Humberto Camejo Arias said military reinforcements have
been sent to the area to search for ``foreign subversives and
probable accomplices.''
   Venezuela increased its military presence on the border in
January because of an increase in kidnappings of Venezuelans by
Colombians and the use of Venezuelan territory by Colombian cocaine
gangs.
   In January, Venezuelan soldiers killed five Colombians in an
exchange of fire across the Arauca River.
   The two nations agreed to coordinate efforts to cut down on
border activity by Colombian criminals.

   Forty-five years after U.S. fighter
pilots killed the mastermind of the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor, American survivors of the mission dispute who actually shot
down Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.
   Yamamoto was killed April 18, 1943, when American fighter planes
intercepted his bomber near the Solomon Islands. Capt. Thomas G.
Lanphier Jr. of Detroit, who died last year, was credited by the
military with the kill.
   But the eight survivors among the 16 Americans who carried out
the mission said at a reunion Saturday that they could not
corroborate the official account because they had not been
debriefed immediately after the attack.
   They said they also could not determine how many Japanese Zero
fighters accompanying Yamamoto's bomber were shot down.
   ```At this time it's a toss up on who shot down the Betty
(bomber) carrying Admiral Yamamoto. Which one was he in? We didn't
know at that point,'' said Ret. Lt. Col. Besby Frank Holmes of San
Francisco. ``The passage of years hasn't clarified the subject.
These accounts add great confusion to the subject.
   ``I wish there would have been a debriefing years ago,'' he
added.
   Holmes and the seven other survivors spoke at a symposium along
with one of the Japanese Zero pilots.
   The gathering was held here because Fredericksburg is the home
of Admiral Chester Nimitz. Nimitz and his superiors approved the
mission after the Americans broke Japan's code and learned that
Yamamoto was going to be in the Solomon Islands.
   Yamamoto planned the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7,
1941, that triggered the United States' entry into World War II.
   Capt. Roger Pineau, a retired naval intelligence officer, said
Yamamoto's death gave the American war effort a major boost.
   ``In addition to the strategic and tactical effects of the shoot
down of Yamamoto, it was a fantastic morale blow to the Japanese
people,'' Pineau said. ``There was mourning in Japan after the
announcement of his death like is seldom seen except for emperors.
He was highly thought of.''
   The Americans attacked two Japanese bombers, one carrying
Yamamoto and the other his chief of staff, Vice Admiral Matome
Ugaki. The bombers were escorted by six Zeros.
   Holmes said he shot down the bomber carrying Ugaki, and Ret.
Col. Rex Barber of Culver, Ore., claimed on Saturday he shot down
Yamamoto's plane.
   Holmes said fights broke out after other pilots challenged their
account of the number of Zeros shot down.
   Kenji Yanagiya, the lone Zero pilot at Saturday's gathering,
added to the controversy when he said through an interpreter that
all six Zeros made it back to base safely. That brought jeers from
a crowd of about 400.
   Of the 16 Americans on the mission, one was listed as missing in
action, two died during later combat and five have died since the
war.
   Items once belonging to Yamamoto were unveiled in a new exhibit
Saturday at the Nimitz Museum here, including swords Yamamoto gave
to his men with the inscription, ``The fate of Japan's future
depends on the outcome of this war.''
   The items were loaned by Kansas City, Mo., resident Bernard
Brannon, whose brother, attorney John Brannon, acquired them after
World War II.
   John Brannon, who died last year, defended Japanese naval
officers charged with war crimes. In return for his services, the
Japanese officers gave him some of Yamamoto's personal items, said
Bruce Smith, superintendent of the Admiral Nimitz State Historical
Park.

   Trade ministers from the
United States, Canada, Japan and the European Community met in
seclusion Saturday for talks on issues ranging from patent
protection to Japanese quotas on U.S. beef.
   The weekend quadrilateral meeting, held twice annually, took
place at a lodge on Quadra Island near Vancouver. The ministers
hold a final news conference Sunday.
   A dozen peaceful protesters against the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement, negotiated last year but not yet ratified, stood on the
road outside the lodge.
   The focus of Saturday's meeting was progress in the current
round of talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
the 95-nation body governing world trade that was set up in 1948.
   The trade negotiations, involving 15 sub-groups, began in
September 1986 and are scheduled for a comprehensive review in
Montreal in December.
   Those talks have ``the most ambitious negotiating agenda in the
history'' of the world trade group, U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter said in a prepared text for a speech delivered
Friday to the Vancouver Board of Trade.
   Yeutter was joined for the quadrilateral meeting by Trade
Ministers Hajime Tamura of Japan, John Crosbie of Canada and Willy
De Clercq of the 12-national European Community.
   The Reagan administration, joined by Canada, is pressing for new
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules to cover services such
as insurance and computer software, trade-related investment,
agriculture and protection for patents, copyrights and trademarks.
   ``Increasingly, countries are resorting to export subsidies and
non-tariff import barriers to achieve advantages over their
competitors,'' Yeutter said.
   Yeutter said he also is looking for prompt Japanese action to
relax tough quotas for U.S. beef and citrus products, or Washington
will press a formal complaint with the 95-nation group.
   Canadian trade official Sylvia Ostry said the erosion of open
trading principles made the current General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade round critical.
   ``The outcome of this round will determine the outcome of the
multilateral trading system, period,'' she said.

   The sheriff of Louisiana's second-largest
parish, told by a federal judge he may no longer withhold news
exclusively from New Orleans' daily newspaper, extended his news
blackout Saturday to all media.
   Sheriff Harry Lee said in a statement that none of his Jefferson
Parish employees will talk with any reporter, except in an
emergency, until his lawyers examine the injunction issued Friday
by U.S. District Judge Robert Collins.
   ``Until this problem has been resolved, the sheriff's office
shall communicate with the press in the form of written press
releases,'' Lee said.
   Collins ruled that the sheriff cannot adopt a policy of treating
the newspaper's reporters any differently than those from other
news organizations. The injunction was obtained by The
Times-Picayune, which has been the target of a news embargo by Lee
since January, when the newspaper refused to change a story the
sheriff objected to.
   In testimony Friday, Lee also complained the newspaper,
Louisiana's largest daily with a weekday circulation of about
280,000, published inaccurate stories about him and his department.
   Because of Lee's news blackout, Times-Picayune reporters
sometimes were physically barred from news conferences.The
newspaper also got news releases a day or so after the news
happened in a parish with a population of nearly half a million,
equal almost to that of New Orleans.
   The sheriff also filed a $1 million defamation suit against the
newspaper.
   Lee made headlines more than a year ago when he announced he
would have deputies stop and question blacks traveling in white
neighborhoods. The furor from civil rights groups prompted him to
withdraw the order the next day and apologize.

   Jesse Jackson's supporters failed to take
control of the South Carolina Democratic Party on Saturday, but did
pick up nearly two-thirds of its delegates to the national
convention.
   The Jackson forces lost in their attempt to block the election
of Frank Holleman as state party chairman and lost in races for
several other leadership posts.
   The feuding leading up to the state convention had become
heated, but Kevin Gray, state campaign coordinator for Jackson,
said the party was not damaged.
   ``No one's walking out of this convention mad,'' he said.
   Jackson's support slipped somewhat since the March 12 precinct
caucuses, when his 54 percent showing appeared to be strong enough
to win him as many as 33 national convention delegates. When the
final step in the process was completed Saturday at the state
convention, Jackson had won 28 delegates.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, whose 7 percent finish in
the precinct caucuses was too weak to claim any national convention
delegates, won seven delegates chosen Saturday.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., whose 18 percent support in the
precinct caucuses was enough to bring him eight national convention
delegates, managed to win nine delegates in Saturday's balloting.
   The state's political infighting erupted over a list of demands
by Gray, who wanted assurances that the state party would work
toward a black-majority congressional district and consult with the
Jackson campaign on hiring party employees.
   Holleman had been considered a shoo-in, but that fell apart when
he refused to support the changes sought by the Jackson campaign.
   Columbia attorney Tom Turnipseed then entered the race, saying
he would honor the Jackson camp's requests. But within 24 hours,
Turnipseed withdrew after several leading black legislators, who
also support Jackson, expressed their satisfaction with Holleman.
   Gray subsequently struck six black legislators from the list of
Jackson delegates eligible to attend the national convention. He
later returned four of them to the list of delegates, saying it was
a ``gesture of conciliation.''
   ``I've got a little apprehension,'' House Speaker Bob Sheheen,
D-Kershaw, said before the convention opened. ``Obviously, if the
Jackson camp's going to be in turmoil, the convention's going to be
in turmoil,'' he said.

   FBI agents investigating a possible link
between the arrest of a Japanese man carrying pipe bombs on the New
Jersey Turnpike and the fatal bombing of a USO club in Naples went
to Italy on Saturday, officials said.
   Forensics experts and other FBI agents traveled to Italy at the
request of Italian authorities, who believe the bombing there was
carried out by members of Japan's terrorist Red Army, said FBI
agent Jeff Maynard in Washington.
   Yu Kikumura, identified by the Japanese foreign ministry as a
suspected Red Army member, was arrested Tuesday at a New Jersey
Turnpike service area in Ridgefield after a state trooper found
three sophisticated homemade bombs and falsified papers in his
possession, authorities said.
   On Thursday, a bomb planted in a car and parked at the USO Club
in Naples exploded, killing five people, including an American
servicewoman.
   FBI bomb experts were attempting to learn if the explosive used
in the Naples bombing was the same as that found in New Jersey,
authorities said.
   ``There is a lot of interest in this,'' Maynard said. ``It would
be common sense for us to look into it to see if there is any
connection.''
   Kikumura, 35, was ordered held without bail Friday by a U.S.
magistrate in Newark.
   He was charged with using a fraudulent visa to enter the
country, and possession of firearms. A preliminary hearing was set
for April 25.
   Authorities with the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office have refused
to discuss any information they may have about where Kikumura was
headed at the time of his arrest.
   They also declined to comment on a report in Saturday's editions
of The New York Times that suggested Kikumura might have been
headed for a meeting of finance ministers of the world's seven
major industrial democracies in Washington. The ministers,
sometimes referred to as the Group of Seven, ended their meeting
Wednesday.
   ``There are all sorts of press reports and we're not going to
comment on any of them,'' said Jim Knights, an FBI spokesman in
Newark.
   The Red Army claimed responsibility for bomb and rocket attacks
last June 9 on the U.S. and British embassies in Rome while while
the leaders of seven Western nations were holding their annual
summit in Venice.
   The group's attacks also include a massacre at Tel Aviv's Lod
airport in Israel in 1972 that left 28 people dead.
   Meanwhile Saturday, attorneys William Kunstler and Ronald Kuby,
who frequently have taken up the cause of radicals, said they were
denied permission to meet with Kikumura after he had requested to
talk with them.
   They said officials at the jail in New York City where Kikumura
was being held told them they had orders not to allow anyone to
meet with him.
   ``It's a flagrant constitutional violation,'' Kuby said. ``For
two days (Kikumura's) been smeared all over the newspapers as an
international terrorist and now he's not allowed to see an
attorney.''
   Lt. Marcus Fernandez, an official with the Justice Department's
Bureau of Prisons at the jail, directed all inquiries to the
assistant warden on Monday.
   Officials said Kikumura used a passport stolen from a Japanese
hospital worker to obtain a U.S. entry visa from the U.S. Embassy
in Paris on Feb. 29. He entered the country on March 8, authorities
said.
   An FBI explosives expert has described the bombs found in
Kikumura's car as anti-personnel devices. Two-thirds of the 18-inch
containers were packed with gunpowder and the rest with steel
pellets.
   In Italy, meanwhile, the chief investigator of the bombing said
the terrorist suspected of parking the car outside the USO club was
aided by a Japanese woman and a man from the Middle East or North
Africa.
   Romano Argenio, head of the Naples anti-terrorist police, said
investigators had identified two of the three as known members of
the Red Army.

   Hundreds of protesters smashed
windows, blocked streets with flaming barricades and clashed with
riot police Saturday in a violent demonstration demanding the
ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga.
   Police fired tear gas and birdshot as about 400 demonstrators,
most of them members of a women's group, rallied on the north side
of the capital. There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
   About 300 women, joined later by about 100 residents of the
Batania section of the city, set up blazing barricades of trash and
tires across some streets and hurled rocks at police.
   Some windows in homes and shops were shattered by stones.
   The women, members of a Union of Civic Women, marched in the
streets following a Mass at the Roman Catholic Church of Perpetuo
Socorro in Batania. They said they prayed to God ``to bring
conscience'' to the Panamanian military to force Noriega to resign.
   At least 10 small police trucks waited outside the church before
the protest began. The Rev. Manuel Villarreal Nunez, who presided
over the Mass, said police approached him during the protest.
   ``I said what a large number they had used to repress a group of
women,'' he said. ``It was an exaggeration.
   ``They said, `Shut up. Get out of here!' and one gave me a
violent push on the chest.''
   Carmen Cecilia Capriles, a leader of the protest, said the
demonstrators wanted Noriega to resign because ``he has the country
in bankruptcy because of his evil corruption.''
   She said the United States did nothing as long Noriega was under
its control ``but this monster has gotten away from them.
   ``For 20 years, we have been shouting not to arm this nation and
they (the Unitd States) have been arming it,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, government spokesman Jose Hernandez said paychecks
due Friday to employees of the cash-short government were delayed
but would be distributed on Monday.
   He said the delay was one of the government's ways of dealing
with the ``situation of economic asphyxiation'' in the country.
   Noriega, chief of Panama's Defense Forces and the country's
strongman, is under indictment by a grand jury in federal courts in
Florida on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.
   The Reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions on
Panama, including freezing Panamanian assets in the United States,
in an effort to oust Noriega. The measures have caused an acute
cash shortage in Panama that has helped spur anti-Noriega protests.
   After the Mass, the women rallied outside the church waving
white handkerchiefs as a sign of protest. They marched carrying
rosaries and chanting ``Justice, justice,'' and ``We want
hospitals, we want medicines.''
   The economic crisis has forced many hospitals to close or
restrict services and reduce staff. Doctors and pharmacists say
there is an acute shortage of medicines.
   Riot squads in trucks used water cannons that sprayed a mixture
of tear gas and water at the demonstrators.
   The women scattered, but gathered again in small groups and
began pelting police squads and the cannon-trucks with rocks and
trash. Police retaliated by firing tear gas and birdshot into the
air.
   There have been few anti-government demonstrations here in
recent days. On April 11, hundreds of teachers demonstrated
peacefully for Noriega's removal.
   On March 28, riot police smashed a protest march by about 10,000
people and arrested more than 20 members of the opposition. On
March 30, a 10-day-old general strike began to lose ground as some
businesses began re-opening, but the country remains gripped by an
economic crisis.

<HEAD>Soviets claim first in flight of liquid hydrogen-fueled plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet plane fueled by liquid hydrogen has
completed a test flight in a major development in aviation, the
official Tass news agency reported Saturday.
   ``A new page has thus been turned in the history of the aircraft
industry in the U.S.S.R. and the whole world,'' Tass said.
   It reported a Tupolev-154 aircraft with jet engines modified to
burn liquid hydrogen had flown sucessfully Friday but did not say
where the flight occurred.
   The evening television news program Vremya showed a videotape of
the flight, that it said was conducted at an airport outside Moscow
but did not identify the airfield.
   Tass said the converted Tu-154, renamed Tu-155, is a significant
advance in aviation because it will not pollute the atmosphere like
conventional jet aircraft with engines that burn oil-based fuels
and produce hydrocarbon pollutants.
   Vremya showed the aircraft's takeoff and landing and a segment
of what it said was the 21-minute flight. The tape showed the
refitted jet accompanied by a conventional Tu-154, and in the
footage the conventional plane's exhaust was black smoke while
Vremya said the Tu-155 emitted harmless steam.
   In an interview with Vremya, V.K. Orlov, the chief engine
designer of the Tu-155, said the engines combined aviation and
rocket technology. He said the liquid hydrogen was stored in tanks
aboard the plane at subfreezing temperatures.
   Most U.S. and Soviet space rocket boosters burn liquid hydrogen
and liquid oxygen.
   Neither Tass nor Vremya said how the engines operated, gave any
cost estimates or said if they would be installed on commercial
jetliners.
   Tass said special fire and explosion safety devices had to be
designed for the plane and ground support equipment.

   After four years of bitter conflict with Frank
Lorenzo and his airline empire, aviation labor is getting the
sweeping government investigation it wanted.
   But Transportation Department officials reject suggestions by
Lorenzo and his Texas Air Corp. that the probe announced Wednesday
is union-inspired.
   Officials say instead a series of financial ``red flags'' and
Texas Air's own request for approval to spin off Eastern Airline's
lucrative Northeast shuttle put senior department analysts on the
alert.
   With that backdrop, the deciding factor that triggered the
unprecedented investigation, say department officials, was word
from the Federal Aviation Administration of continuing safety
violations at Eastern Airlines.
   ``Other carriers have been in precarious financial positions in
the past and others have had safety violations in the past, but
we're not aware of a carrier having both come together this way at
the same time,'' said Matthew Scocozza, whose DOT office monitors
the major airlines.
   The broad investigation of Texas Air and its two subsidiary
airlines, Eastern and Continental, stunned executives at the
Houston-based airline company. Texas Air stock dropped $1.50 per
share, to $10.25, in two days and executives at both Eastern and
Continental worried what impact the publicity would have on
customers.
   But the turmoil surrounding Texas Air has been years in the
making.
   Lorenzo gained the wrath of organized aviation labor in 1983
when he shut down Continental Airlines, threw out its labor
contracts and within days started a new airline with employees
earning 50 percent less. Since Texas Air purchased Eastern Airlines
in 1986, there have been continuous and rancorous confrontations
over management demands for deep labor concessions.
   Lorenzo blames his troubles with labor for the government probe.
   ``There is no question that this issue is founded in an
old-fashioned labor dispute,'' said a corporate statement. ``The
union leaderships ... have mounted a continuing campaign of
distortion and lies. It is unfortunate that this campaign has
swayed others into action.''
   Eastern Airlines put advertisements into major newspapers the
day after the investigation was announced, saying it welcomed the
probe and hoped it would clear the air about the union's charges
and ``show unfair treatment of Eastern'' by the FAA.
   On Sunday, Texas Air put a full-page advertisement in several
major newspapers that featured an editorial from Friday's New York
Times. The editorial concluded: ``Texas Air has offended organized
labor, the industry establishment and a lot of important people in
Washington. The airline has also irritated a lot of travelers....
It would be a pity, though, if these complaints distracted
attention from Texas Air's constructive role in forcing a
self-satisfied, cartel-minded industry to come to terms with
competition.''
   Ironically, the order to investigate Texas Air came from a
Transportation Department that over the years has been considered
anything but friendly to labor. In nearly two dozen airline
mergers, the department not once has approved formal
labor-protection provisions sought by the unions.
   While the department denies being forced into action by labor,
there is little doubt that the unions' well-financed and determined
campaign drew the government's attention.
   The FAA's intense look at Eastern Airlines last year, for
example, was in part prompted by union reports of alleged
maintenance and safety violations, including charges repeated at
congressional hearings that management was trying to force crews to
fly unsafe aircraft.
   Pilots began sending postcards to aviation committees in
Congress, the FAA and its parent DOT whenever there were
maintenance problems with Eastern planes.
   Labor challenges in court to the transfer of the Northeast
shuttle from Eastern into a separate Texas Air subsidiary also
caused DOT officials concern after a federal judge came down on the
side of the unions.
   When the judge stopped the transfer and found Texas Air in
contempt of court for violating an earlier court injunction, the
department began to question the airline's attitude about complying
with government requirements, said Wayne Vance, the DOT's general
counsel.
   ``We had been aware of what was going on within the world of
Texas Air Corp.,'' said Vance. But he added that with the court
decision on the shuttle ``concern grew and grew.''
   An internal department ``alert memo'' was prepared noting Texas
Air's record losses of $466 million in 1987, and its debts of more
than $5 billion _ requiring $600 million in interest payments.
   New filings, meanwhile, by Texas Air with the Securities and
Exchange Commission raised additional ``red flags,'' Vance and
Scocozza noted. The SEC filings provided more details on a series
of bothersome transactions between Texas Air and Eastern that
suggested assets were being drained from Eastern.
   Texas Air had moved Eastern's valuable computer reservation
system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note likely
worth less than the system's fair market value; Texas Air charged
``substantial fees'' for various services to Eastern; and the
parent company never paid Eastern $16 million it promised as a
reimbursement from costs incurred during its 1986 acquisition of
the airline.
   Amid this backdrop came word from the FAA that a year after
Eastern agreed to pay $9.5 million in fines for safety violations,
many of the same violations seemed to persist. Eastern faces an
additional possible fine of $823,000, and a new round of special
inspections.
   That, say Scocozza and Vance, sealed the case for a broader
inquiry into the Lorenzo aviation empire.
   ``The ball is now in the government's court,'' said Jack Bavis,
head of the pilots union at Eastern. ``We know what the problems
are. What remains to be seen is how well the DOT and FAA follow
through on their announcements.''

   Despite congressional pressure, the Army said
Friday it won't provide the land or help build a large church for
the exclusive use of Mormon employees at a Utah military
installation.
   ``The Army is opposed in principle to the construction and
exclusive use of a private house of worship by any religious
organization on a military installation,'' Assistant Army Secretary
Delbert L. Spurlock wrote in a letter to congressional committees.
   Some 700 Mormon workers at the isolated Dugway Proving Ground
are asking for their own religious facility, claiming the building
now shared by all the installation's religious demominations is too
small.
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, has argued that better space is needed
because so many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints work at the isolated base.
   But Spurlock said in his letter, ``No statutory authority exists
which would permit this at Dugway and, if such authority were
proposed (by Congress), it would likely'' violate constitutional
provisions against the government establishment of religion.
   Moreover, while the Army building now being used by Mormon
employees at Dugway as their church is ``substandard,'' that
building by itself ``is more than twice the religious education
facility size authorized for the entire Dugway population,'' the
service said.
   If the Army obtains money to build new religious facilities at
Dugway, those buildings would have to be shared by all
denominations and will certainly be smaller than the buildings now
used, the Army said.
   Spurlock's comments were contained in a cover letter that
accompanied a special report to the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees on Friday. The report was requested by Congress in
December at the urging of Garn, who is a Mormon.
   The Mormons at the base are currently allowed exclusive use of a
warehouse they have renovated as a chapel, but would like to build
a larger, modern facility at the base.
   Dugway is a research and test site for chemical weapons located
about 90 miles west of Salt Lake City and about 40 miles from the
nearest town. There are about 700 Mormons at Dugway, which employs
roughly 1,700 people. Most of the workers are civilians.
   The Mormon workers turned to Garn for help after the Army
rejected the church's request for a long-term lease on 2.5 acres of
land to construct a building. Garn has said through a spokeswoman
that if the Army doesn't come up with an acceptable plan to provide
adequate space, he will ask Congress to order the Army to issue a
lease.
   Laurie Snow, the senator's spokeswoman, declined comment Friday,
saying Garn had not yet seen the report.
   The report, however, hardly appears likely to satisfy the Mormon
workers.
   Given the ``current austere budget conditions,'' it says, ``it
is not anticipated'' any money could be requested from Congress
during the next five years to upgrade the existing facilities at
Dugway.
   There are at least 55 ``critical Army religious projects'' with
a higher priority, the report states.
   ``And the Army is opposed, on principle, to construction of a
private house of worship by any religious organization on any
military installation,'' the service concluded.
   ``To allow such construction favors religious groups with the
financial resources to build. It also places religious groups that
are without those resources at a disadvantage.''

   President Virgilio Barco declared a
state of siege in the Uraba region, scene of several massacres of
peasants, and gave an army general broad powers to end the violence.
   Barco announced the action Thursday night. The president has
special powers under a state of emergency that has been in effect
throughout Colombia for 30 years because of leftist guerrilla
violence.
   Under the siege, which goes beyond a state of emergency, Barco
gave Gen. Fernando Gomez Barros military, political and civil
control of Uraba, authorizing him to take whatever steps necessary
to bring peace to the rich agricultural and ranching area of
northern Colombia.
   ``The entire nation has followed with an enormous sense of pain
and with complete rejection the situation of unbridled violence in
the prosperous region of Uraba,'' the president said.
   He also announced measures to alleviate the ``deep social and
economic roots'' of the violence.
   Leaders of peasant unions blame the Uraba massacres on ``death
squads'' created by landowners to expel thousands of peasant
squatters. Justice Minister Enrique Low Murtra has attributed the
bloodshed to ultra-rightist groups.
   In the past two months, more than 100 people have been killed in
attacks by armed groups on peasants, workers and others in Uraba
and other eastern and northern sections of Colombia.
   Uraba is in the department of Antioquia and has a Caribbean
coastline extending to Panama, about 550 miles north of Bogota.

   Robert Chambers apologized for the first time
Friday for the ``preppie murder'' case death of 18-year-old
Jennifer Levin as he was formally sentenced to five to 15 years in
jail for manslaughter.
   ``The Levin family have gone through hell because of my actions,
and I'm sorry,'' Chambers said. ``Whoever said time heals all
wounds is definitely wrong, because how can these wounds heal?''
   Despite his statement of remorse, the 21-year-old Chambers
repeatedly shook his head as if to say ``no'' to his plea and
sentencing, and Miss Levin's uncle said afterward the apology
carried little weight.
   Chambers stood silently while state Supreme Court Justice Howard
E. Bell handed down the sentence, which was agreed to by lawyers
for both sides when Chambers entered the guilty plea to a reduced
charge of manslaughter March 25.
   The plea came after the jurors in the highly publicized case
reported they were deadlocked on the murder charge in their ninth
day of deliberations. Chambers began his sentence the day after the
plea was entered.
   Miss Levin's partially nude body was found in Central Park early
in the morning of Aug. 26, 1986, a few hours after they had left a
fashionable East Side bar together.
   Chambers had claimed that the death occurred by accident when
Miss Levin hurt him during ``rough sex.'' By pleading guilty to
manslaughter, Chambers admitted he intended to hurt Miss Levin.
   Miss Levin's father, Steven, who had also asked to address the
court, was not allowed to. But he later released a statement,
saying that Chambers' ``outrageous lie'' had defamed ``the memory
of our lovely child.''
   Chambers sighed deeply before starting his remarks. He
apologized to his family and friends, as well as Miss Levin's, and
thanked more than 150 supporters for letters he said he has
received since being jailed on his guilty plea.
   ``Jennifer's looking down on us now at this circus arena,
looking and wondering why it all happened and I don't know,''
Chambers said. ``I never wished any of this to happen. ... I wish
to apologize to the family and to her friends for all the trouble
they have gone through.''
   Miss Levin's father, his wife and his ex-wife left their
courtroom seats and exited without comment on the sentence or the
Chambers apology. They had approved the plea bargain deal prior to
Chambers' March 25 guilty plea.
   But Miss Levin's uncle did comment, saying Chambers' apology
``in no way cancels out what he did, which was to murder my niece
in cold blood. To me, it was just something he rehearsed by rote
and spit out ... to get away with the least possible sentence.''
   In a 2{-page letter he had initially wanted to read in court,
Miss Levin's father wrote: ``The outrageous lie conceived by
Jennifer's killer to rid himself of all responsibility was used by
his attorney to defame the memory of our lovely child. Never left
to mourn our daughter's death in privacy, our lives became the
media event of the year.''
   The plea bargain also took care of three burglary charges
against Chambers, who received a concurrent five-to-15-year
sentence for a burglary count on Friday.
   Also in the courtroom for the sentencing were several Chambers
trial jurors, whose deliberations ended with Chambers' guilty plea.
   ``I feel sorry for Robert Chambers in that he cannot come to
grips with what he did,'' said juror Cole Wallace, 31, after the
sentencing. ``Personally, I thought it (his statement) was somewhat
self-serving.''

   A state of emergency imposed on Lima in

another two months, the government announced.
   Guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement recently resumed
attacks in Lima after months of relative calm.
   In the past week they killed the Yugoslav manager of a Lima
textile factory involved in a labor dispute, shot to death three
policemen and attacked three government-operated grocery stores in
slum districts.
   Parts of seven states, where more than half of Peru's people

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham announced Friday
he will not fight his Senate impeachment conviction or the
cancellation of Arizona's gubernatorial recall election but will
remain politically active.
   ``We would have to go to the Supreme Court of the U.S., and the
legal costs make that prohibitive,'' Mecham said on KTSP-TV's
``Face the State'' program, which was taped Friday to be aired on
Sunday.
   Mecham, 63, said he plans to write a book about his
accomplishments in office and take a vacation with his wife.
   He also said he will keep his Glendale office open and establish
two politial action committees to help elect candidates who
represent ``the people.''
   ``It's a plain, old ordinary swan song,'' he told reporters
outside the studio where the taping was held.
   Mecham was ousted by the Senate April 4 on charges that he
obstructed justice and misused state money, becoming the first U.S.
governor impeached and removed from office in 59 years.
   Arizona's Supreme Court earlier this week ordered the
cancellation of a May 17 recall election because its target,
Mecham, already had been removed. The former governor had said he
would run in the election unless barred by law.
   Mecham said during the interview Friday he has ``no intention of
plea-bargaining'' in his upcoming criminal trial on charges of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, and added, ``I expect to be
acquitted.''

   An international forum of religious
leaders and legislators declared Friday that the 140 delegates from
60 nations will strive together for ``a fundamentally changed and
better world.''
   A statement at the end of the five-day Global Forum of Spiritual
and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival pledged to work against
the perils of armaments, for balancing resources and populations,
and in aid of ``vulnerable groups, particularly women and
children.''
   ``This meeting is a timely convergence of hearts, minds and
events,'' the statement said. ``Human society is in a period of
intense introspection, gripped by fear, uncertainty and confusion.
   ``We therefore now affirm our shared vision of survival, and we
commit ourselves to work for a fundamentally changed and better
world.''
   The five main religions _ Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism,
Islam and Judaism _ were represented along with African religions,
the Jainism offshoot of Hinduism, and Shinto and Sikhism.
   Among the many speakers were the Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, spiritual head of the Church of England and worlwide
Anglican communion; American astronomer Carl Sagan; Mother Teresa,
the Nobel Peace Prize winner whose organization cares for the poor
and dying in 80 countries; Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the Dalai Lama, the exiled Buddhist
god-king of Tibet.
   ``This meeting was very important and another sign of the change
from confrontation to cooperation after the Soviet-U.S. agreements
on intermediate nuclear missiles and Afghanistan,'' Velikhov said.
   Paul N. Temple, chairman of Energy Development Corp., a U.S.
company sponsoring the forum, said: ``It developed almost a family
spirit across the enormous diversity of religion and national
affiliations. Channels of dialogue are opening that never existed
before.''
   Ayman Abdelkader Ahwal of the Moslem World League's London
office said, however: ``Although it might have been unintentional,
it has been a Christian-orientated conference, as is perhaps the
tone of world politics.
   ``The conference ignored the situation in the Middle East, which
is terribly dangerous. Religion is politics and they cannot be
separated to a truly religious person.''
   Dean James Parks Morton of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John
the Divine in New York, said China did not attend because of the
Dalai Lama's presence, but organizers left two seats vacant on the
leadership body in hopes of obtainig representatives of Taoism and
Confucianism.
   The conference was the idea of Akio Matsumura, a Japanese expert
on population who lives in New York and spent 15 years promoting
this week's meeting.
   On the last day, conference delegates gave a standing ovation to
two American Indian leaders in traditional costume who said their
ancestors foretold the ills of the modern world long ago.
   Thomas Banyacya, a Hopi elder from Arizona, held up a
reproduction of an ancient rock painting near Oraibi, east of the
Grand Canyon, that he said appears to predict nuclear destruction,
space travel and the ravaging of the environment.
   Chief Oren R. Lyons of the Onandaga nation, a history professor
at the State University of New York in Buffalo, read a letter Chief
Seattle wrote to President Franklin Pierce in 1855 that said the
white man's hunger for land would ``eat the Earth bare and leave
only a desert.''
   ``Continue to soil your bed and one night you will suffocate in
your own waste,'' the chief declared.

   A former pre-school teacher was convicted
Friday of sexually assaulting 19 children and endangering the
welfare of a 20th child at a now-defunct day care center.
   Margaret Kelly Michaels, 26, of Pittsburgh, was found guilty of
115 counts and acquitted on 16.
   Parents of the youngsters cried, as did Ms. Michaels, while the
jury read its verdict concluding a 10-month trial and 13 days of
deliberations.
   Superior Judge William F. Harth revoked Ms. Michaels' $25,000
bail and ordered her jailed pending sentencing May 26. Ms. Michaels
could be sentenced to more than 1,000 years in prison and fined
more than $3 million.
   Defense attorneys Harvey Meltzer and Robert Clark said only that
they will appeal.
   Ms. Michaels was accused of sexually abusing, terrorizing and
endangering the children, ages 3 to 5, between October 1984, when
she was hired, and April 1985, when she resigned from the Wee Care
Day Nursery in Maplewood.
   Prosecutors said Ms. Michaels engaged in nude sex play with the
children, including nude pileups, performed sex acts on them with
kitchen utensils, played the piano in the nude and forced the
toddlers to perform sex acts on her.
   The charges ranged from aggravated sexual assault to endangering
the welfare of a child.
   Eighteen children testified by videotape, a 19th child testified
by audio tape, and the father of a 20th child who did not testify
was called to the stand.
   Ms. Michaels testified she could not have abused the children
because of the presence of other teachers and time constraints. The
defense had said there were inconsistencies in the children's
testimony and that they were coached on what to say.
   Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Sara Senser McArdle hugged and
kissed the parents of the children. ``Justice has been served, but
this is not a happy day,'' she told one mother.
   At a news conference, Ms. McArdle said the investigation and
trial were difficult because ``we had extremely traumatized
children ... who felt guilty'' that they had participated in sexual
acts.
   One mother, whose 8-year-old daughter was among the victims,
said of Ms. Michaels: ``I'm sorry for her. But I hate her for what
she did to the children.''

<TEXT>
   About 140 people claiming they
backed fascist Italy's occupation forces in Yugoslavia during World
War II say they should receive Italian war pensions, newspapers
reported Friday.
   The state-run press said the claimants are trying to fight a
sharp drop in living standards by trying to receive the Italian
military pensions, which it said are about three times higher than
the average Yugoslav pension of about $100 a month.
   Communist Yugoslavia is faced with a 170 percent inflation rate,
Europe's highest.
   The citizens from Ljubusko, a town near the central Adriatic
coast, have submitted documentary evidence proving that they
belonged to ``a volunteer anti-communist militia'' formed by
Italian occupation authorities to fight partisans during the war,
the NIN weekly said.
   Media reports said the citizens of Ljubusko got the idea after
several thousand Yugoslavs from the northern region of Istria
recently received back payments from Italy for wartime service.
   The Istria residents were forcibly mobilized by the Italian army
during the war.
   In a critical commentary titled, ``I Request To Be Declared An
Enemy,'' the Borba daily said the fascist Italian militia committed
atrocities and terrorized the local population during World War II.
   Nazi Germany and Italy invaded Yugoslavia in 1941 and fought
Yugoslav partisan troops until 1945, when they were driven from the
country.
   But thousands of Yugoslavs joined the occupation forces and
fought the partisans.
   The Ljubusko citizens submitted their request for Italian
pensions to Yugoslav authorities, said the NIN newspaper. It said
local authorities told the applicants to address their requests
directly to Italy.
   But the press said there was little chance for the claimants to
get Italian war pensions even if it is proved they joined the
Italian occupation troops, because they belonged to a volunteer
body of anti-partisan fighters and not to a regular army unit.
   The Italian Embassy in Belgrade said only Italian pension
officials could decide on the claims.

<HEAD>Court Eliminates Most U.S. Questions in Letelier Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has severely trimmed a
list of questions U.S. prosecutors want answered by a general who
led the Chilean investigation into dissident Orlando Letelier's
1976 assassination in Washington.
   In its ruling, the court said Gen. Hector Orozco could not be
questioned about any official activities related to his role as
military prosecutor in Chile's probe of the killing.
   It said permitting such questions would ``violate national
sovereignty and the justice system'' and Orozco could only be
questioned on matters not directly related to his official actions.
   The court threw out all but 12 of the 33 groups of questions
included in a 25-page document prepared by Washington prosecutors
and presented to Chilean authorities in January.
   It made the ruling Thursday and the decision was reported Friday.
   Letelier and an American aide, Ronnie Moffitt, were killed when
a remote-controlled bomb exploded in their car on Sept. 21, 1976,
as it traveled on Washington's embassy row.
   Letelier, a former ambassador and Cabinet minister in the
government of the late President Salvador Allende, was a critic of
the right-wing military government of President Augusto Pinochet.
   Gen. Pinochet, commander of the army, led the coup in September
1973 that ousted Allende, a Marxist.
   A Washington court in 1978 indicted three Chilean army officers,
all secret police agents, in connection with the Letelier killing.
The Chilean Supreme Court rejected an extradition request, but in
early 1987 one of the officers, Maj. Armando Fernandez Larios,
surrendered in Washington and confessed to an accomplice's role.
   Last year Washington again called on Chile to hand over the
other two officers, former secret police chief Gen. Manuel
Contreras and his aide Col. Pedro Espinoza.
   On the basis of Fernandez Larios' confession, U.S. prosecutors
decided to seek to question Orozco. Fernandez Larios said Orozco
ordered him to lie to the Supreme Court and deny any role in the
assassination. In its new ruling, the court tossed out all
questions about the alleged order.
   The court also struck several questions related to an alleged
conversation between Orozco and Contreras, in which Contreras was
said to have acknowledged ordering Espinoza to arrange the killing.
   Contreras also allegedly said he himself was acting on orders
and, when asked by Orozco from whom, replied ``ask the chief.''
Fernandez Larios, who said he heard about the conversation from a
third party to it, told U.S. authorities he believed ``the chief''
meant Pinochet, who was Contreras' immediate superior.

   Princeton University has gone to court to
block a police request for medical records of 45 students
hospitalized for excessive drinking at two of the Ivy League
school's eating clubs.
   Joining the university in its efforts are the Medical Center at
Princeton, the Mercer Council on Alcoholism and the state Division
of Alcoholism. Arguments are scheduled April 22 in Mercer County
Superior Court.
   Princeton borough police are seeking access to records of 39
students treated at the university infirmary and six students
treated at the medical center after parties at the Charter Club and
Cloister Inn on Feb. 6.
   The eating clubs are private clubs similar to fraternities.
   Princeton police have charged five students who are present or
former officers at the two clubs with maintaining a nuisance, which
carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Police Capt. Thomas Michaud said the medical records will help
in the prosecution of the defendants but are not vital to the case.
   Superior Court Judge Neil Shuster granted police access to the
medical records March 23, but the university won a suspension of
the court order until next week's hearing.
   The university and medical center argued in court papers that
releasing the information breaches the students' privilege of
doctor-patient confidentiality.
   Alexander P. Waugh Jr., an attorney for the medical center and
the university, said Friday that release of the records would
discourage students from seeking treatment for drug and alcohol
problems.
   A friend-of-the-court brief was filed Thursday by the alcoholism
council, which supports the position of the university and
hospital. The Division of Alcoholism also wrote an affidavit in
support of the brief.

<HEAD>Five Detained Journalists Released</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five journalists arrested recently in a
government crackdown on the news media were released Friday after a
90-minute meeting with President Samuel Doe.
   The meeting took place after the Press Union of Liberia
threatened to file a court suit challenging the detentions of the
journalists and the government ban of two newspapers.
   Lamini Waritay, president of the Press Union, said no decision
had been made on whether to pursue the court action. ``We have not
ruled out legal measures but since we see this (the release) as a
goodwill measure we feel we have some room to maneuver,'' he said.
   No details were available on Doe's meeting with the journalists.
   About a half-hour before the five were released, Information
Minister Emmanuel Bowier told The Associated Press he was unaware
any journalists had been arrested.
   After being freed, the five met briefly at the offices of the
independent Observor newspaper.
   Isaac Bantu, a reporter for the banned Footprints Today
newspaper said he was all right but had suffered a leg injury while
in detention.
   Bantu, who does free-lance work for AP and the British
Broadcasting Corp., was detained Monday along with four other
Footprints Today journalists. Last week the government ordered the
closure of the Sun Times newspaper.
   In the interview, Bowier said, ``Up to the last two weeks ... we
had the freest press on the continent of Africa and no one can
dispute this. But we cannot have the press ... inciting people,
talking about secret killings, kinds of situations that do not
happen here.''
   Last week a former Doe aide, David Clarke, testified in court
that he and five other defendants took part in the ritual killing
of two boys so that parts of their bodies could be used to make a
potion to improve the killers' political future.
   News reports of that case were criticized by some officials.
Earlier, Bowier claimed journalists had misrepresented his remarks
about the death in police custody of an alleged coup plotter.

<HEAD>Government Threatens To Close Three Publications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday
warned two anti-apartheid newspapers and a magazine that they would
be shut down if they continue to print material it consideres
subversive.
   Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha, who has state-of-emergency
powers to close publications considered subversive, issued the
threats in a government gazette published Friday.
   Receiving the warnings were Grassroots and Saamstaan, two
community newspapers, and Out of Step, a magazine published every
two months by the End Conscription Campaign that opposes the
mandatory military service for white males.
   Botha said the publications were ``a threat to public safety.''
   He recently closed one black-oriented weekly newspaper, The New
Nation, for 12 weeks and has told several other anti-apartheid
publications they face similar action.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Alistair Teeling-Smith, national secretary of the End
Conscription Campaign, said shutting down his magazine would be
pointless.
   ``Even if the publications are silenced, the issue of
conscription and its problems remains,'' he said. ``A more
satisfactory way of addressing these problems would be to provide a
reasonable system of alternative service.''
   White South African males must serve two years of military
service initially and then are liable for annual training camps.
   The anti-draft group says it particularly opposes the deployment
of conscripts in black townships and in wars in South-West Africa,
also known as Namibia, and in neighboring Angola.

   Police captured a suspect Friday
in the abduction of a wealthy businessman's two sons and recovered
more than $1 million in a ransom payment during a shootout,
television reported.
   TV Globo said one of the suspected kidnappers fled during the
shootout in the southern resort town of Balneario Camboriu, 570
miles southwest of Rio.
   The family paid the ransom on Monday and the two sons of Saul
Brandalise Jr., Saul 14 and Jean Paul 8, were freed Wednesday.
   According to the television network, which showed tape of the
gunfight, police tracked two suspects to a hotel in the resort town.
   It said police and the alleged kidnappers exchanged shots for
several hours and one of the suspects was wounded and surrendered
while the other fled.
   Police recovered more than $1 million of the $1.2 million ransom
paid by the family, the report said.
   The boys were kidnapped April 7 from the family home in Videira,
a rural town 900 miles southwest of Rio. Their father is the
president of the Perdiagao Food Processing Group.

   The government said Friday it will free
all 1,000 political prisoners to help create a ``congenial
atmosphere.'' Opposition leaders claimed at least 8,000 people are
imprisoned for political reasons.
   State-run Radio Bangladesh quoted Interior Minister Abdul Matin
as saying opposition political activists arrested during
anti-government protests will be freed soon.
   Matin did not give a time schedule or specify how many prisoners
were being held, but an Interior Ministry official said the process
had begun to free the prisoners.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least
5,000 political prisoners had been detained since the opposition
launched its anti-governmnent campaign on Nov. 10. But he said that
some 4,000 were released before the March 3 parliamentary elections.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's Jatiya Party won the
elections that were boycotted by opposition leaders.
   ``We will release all political detainees to create a congenial
atmosphere,'' the radio broadcast quoted Matin as telling police
officials meeting in Dhaka.
   The announcement followed the lifting of a 4-month-old state of
emergency on April 12.

   Dozens of offers to adopt Clark the
wander dog have been made since the story of the mutt who hangs out
at a now-vacant transportation complex was circulated, but Clark is
staying put.
   Attempts by Leora Reed to coax Clark from the complex to a new
life with a new owner have been fruitless.
   Clark has been roaming the former Horizon Transportation
Services Corp. site and the adjacent former Clark Equipment Co.
property. Workers at both companies provided a dog house and food
until Clark Equipment closed last fall, followed by Horizon's
demise in March.
   When Horizon's last employee, Barbara Renbarger, left last
month, Clark was alone except for Reed, his new friend. She noticed
the dog several weeks ago and began trying to find him a home.
   ``I have a great love for dogs and I just sort of felt sorry for
the little guy,'' she said. ``I fell in love with him.''
   Clark has returned the friendship through approving wags of the
tail when Reed brings food to him. But he has frustrated her
attempts to capture him or coax him off the properties. She even
hired a veterinarian to use a dart to tranquilize Clark, but two
attempts have failed. Clark was scared and maintained his practice
of keeping his distance from all humans.
   More than 25 people wanted to adopt the dog, including one woman
in Louisville, Ky., who offered to fly Clark to her home.
   The publicity that brought the adoption offers has also brought
Clark a local windfall of edible contributions.
   ``Some have brought prime rib bones or hamburger or chicken,''
Reed said. ``He has at least a 10-course meal every day.''
   Reed said she has given up trying to get Clark to leave.
Horizon's new owners, who have asked that the name of the company
be kept secret for now, have told her Clark can stay and she can
visit him anytime.
   ``I have learned that possibly my way is not the best way,''
Reed said. ``Even though he is living in the wild, he is capable of
taking care of himself. I hate to take his freedom away.''
   Clark will still have his dog house and can wander the property.

   A veteran U.S. Marine sergeant's
account of his company's alleged firefight with mysterious
intruders at a fuel depot near Panama City has left unanswered a
number of major questions.
   Foremost among them: Who were the ``highly professional''
intruders he said moved in military formations, wore dark uniforms,
carried sophisticated night-vision equipment and were ``trying to
provoke'' the Marines?
   First Sgt. Alexander J. Nevglovski declined to speculate Friday
on whether the intruders he said he and his men engaged in a
two-hour firefight Tuesday night were Panamanian soldiers.
   But, asked to assess the motives and actions of intruders he
said appeared Monday and Tuesday night at the Arraijan Tank Farm
near Howard Air Force Base, the 24-year Marine veteran replied:
   ``They were training. They were using us for training aides.
They were harassing us. They were very provoking.''

   For Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, the
Mr. Smooth of the Reagan administration, it was a rare public
relations disaster.
   He had a careful script which called for finance leaders of the
seven major industrial countries to demonstrate close-knit harmony
as a way of reassuring financial markets of their resolve to
continue stabilizing the dollar.
   The group's communique, which included many of Baker's pet
proposals, was approved and issued on schedule Wednesday. But after
that, the script went badly awry.
   Instead of rallying on the news, financial markets chose to
focus the next day on a disappointing report that the U.S. trade
deficit unexpectedly rose in February to $13.8 billion. The bad
news sent the dollar into a nosedive, and the major industrial
countries had to launch hurriedly a multimillion-dollar rescue
effort to try to brake the fall.

   A detailed explanation by Soviet officials of
a mysterious anthrax outbreak in 1979 has left U.S. experts divided
over longstanding allegations that the epidemic stemmed from an
accident related to biological warfare experiments.
   According to a lecture and slide show presented by Soviet health
officials over the last week in Washington, Baltimore and
Cambridge, Mass., the outbreak stemmed from a batch of contaminated
bone meal fed to livestock, whose meat, in turn, caused the deaths
of 66 people in Sverdlovsk, a city of 1.2 million in the Ural
Mountains.
   The long-awaited Soviet explanation ``leaves many questions
unanswered,'' said Gary B. Crocker, a State Department analyst

biological and chemical weapons. ``It does not fit with the

convictions has been set aside to provide a brighter future for

   The University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa has established what is
believed to be the nation's first college scholarship for

   Of the $10,000, about $6,000 came from Social Security checks
that Howard, who died in 1986, had deposited in a bank in Dothan.
The joint bank account was set up by Howard and Jim Loftin, a
former employer who had befriended him, before Howard went to

   The statue of Alma Mater with a ``RAPED'' sign around her neck.
   A student sitting at the president's desk, puffing one of the
president's cigars.
   Police vans rolling across College Walk.
   For a time it seemed revolution had come to the Ivy League. The
dean was held hostage. A professor lost a decade's research when a
protester torched his files. Two students were married in an
occupied building by a minister who crawled through the window.
   About 1,000 people, mostly students, barricaded themselves
inside five campus buildings for a week, closing the college and
drawing international attention to their opposition to racism, the
Vietnam War and the status quo in general.
   Columbia was just one stop on the bumpy road from Berkeley to
Kent State, but a memorable one. ``The atmosphere was like the
French Revolution,'' said Fred Friendly, a journalism professor and
former CBS News producer. ``You expected to see Robespierre on the
next block.''
   Today, Mark Rudd, chairman of Students for a Democratic Society
at Columbia in 1968, still refers to university officials as ``war
criminals.'' And Paul Vilardi, who as a student led opposition to
the revolt, characterizes the protesters as ``nobodies, loners and
oddballs.''
   The rebellion began almost by accident: 500 students, led by the
SDS and the Student Afro-American Society, tried to invade the
administration building April 23, but found the doors locked.
   Someone in the crowd urged a march to the site of a gymnasium
the school had started to build in Morningside Park, a buffer
between elite, white Columbia and impoverished, black Harlem.
   For months, three issues had festered: the gym, which became a
symbol of Columbia's neighborhood expansion; Columbia's links to
the Institute for Defense Analyses, which commissioned military
research, and school disciplinary action against SDS leaders for
previous demonstrations.
   At the gym site, the students tore down a construction fence and
fought with police. Then they marched back to campus, into Hamilton
Hall and up to the door of Acting Dean Henry Coleman.
   When Coleman refused to discuss the students' demands under
those circumstances, the students told him he could not leave.
Later that night, SDS left the building to the black students and
went off to seize Low Library, the domed administration building
whose steps provided a stage for the ensuing drama.
   Coleman was released after about 24 hours, but other groups of
students seized three more buildings. Faculty members ringed the
buildings to prevent violence and tried to negotiate a settlement.
   The rebellion quickly became a happening, with extensive news
coverage and appearances by Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Rap Brown,
Stokely Carmichael, William Kunstler, Herbert Marcuse, Allen
Ginsberg and the Grateful Dead.
   Columbia President Grayson Kirk called in the police April 30.
They cleared the buildings and made 692 arrests, about 75 percent
of them Columbia students or teachers. Hospitals treated 103
patients, 85 of them students or teachers.
   A student strike ensued, and a month later students again
occupied Hamilton Hall to protest the discipline of protest
leaders; again the police moved in, this time with fewer arrests
(68) and more injuries (177).
   Today, those who fought the battle of Columbia reminisce like
the veterans of any war.
   ``We feel good about what we did, and under the same
circumstances we'd do it again,'' said Andrea Egan, 44, who was
married in occupied Fayerweather Hall. ``Some people talk about the
strike now as if it was a panty raid, but it's important for those
of us who were there to say, `It had great significance.'''
   Working from an old arrest list, Ms. Egan has organized a
protest reunion on campus April 22-23.
   ``My guess is that nine out of 10 still put their principles
into practice in some way,'' she said. ``Not many of us can afford
to be full-time activists, but you see the strikers' convictions in
the type of law or medicine they practice, the films they make, or
the way we raise our children.''
   Few, if any, have run for political office. ``Most of us could
not stand the scrutiny candidates get,'' Ms. Egan said. ``Not only
the strike, but sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll. We couldn't do a
(U.S. Circuit Judge Douglas H.) Ginsburg and say, `I only did it
twice.'''
   After the rebellion, the veterans scattered. Cicero Wilson, a
black student leader, wound up at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute. Ted Gold, a member of the radical Weather
Underground, was killed when a homemade bomb exploded in a
Greenwich Village townhouse. David Gilbert is serving a 75-year
prison sentence for his role in a 1981 armored car robbery.
   Rudd, the most celebrated protest leader, resurfaced from the
underground in 1977 and now lives in Albuquerque, N.M., where he is
writing his autobiography and working against U.S. involvement in
Central America.
   Today, he claims victory: ``What we did wasn't futile. We won.
We stopped the war.''
   To Vilardi, leader of the anti-protest Majority Coalition, that
is nonsense. ``I don't really see where anything happened (as a
result of the rebellion),'' said Vilardi, a surgeon in Huntsville,
Texas. ``You'd have to be incredibly naive to think that the people
who made the decisions in Washington cared what a bunch of jerks
were doing up in New York.''
   Orest Ranum, the professor whose papers were burned, moved to
Johns Hopkins University in 1969. He says he's glad he spoke
against the occupation: ``I got out of the library and took a step
further into the types of human experiences that change the world.''
   Coleman, now an educational consultant, says he later wrote law
school recommendations for some of the students who held him
captive. Bill Sales, one of the black students who took over
Hamilton Hall, is back on campus, finishing a stint as a Revson
fellow.
   Columbia ``has changed a whole lot, and not for the better,''
said Sales, who lives in Harlem. ``There's less sense of social
responsibility among students and faculty, and more separation of
town and gown.''
   The university eventually dropped its criminal case against most
students. School disciplinary measures bogged down for months in
the trial-like proceedings established after the uprising.
   A few students were suspended. ``Permanent Censure'' was stamped
on some transcripts. Fellowships were lost, law school admissions
denied.
   Columbia severed its link with the Institute for Defense
Analyses, although some professors continue to do classified
military research. The university regularly incurs the wrath of
some neighbors in its role as a large institutional lanlord and
developer.
   Columbia eventually built a gym on the other side of campus. The
Parks Department says it finally plans to erase the uprising's last
physical scar _ the gym's foundation hole on a rocky hillside in
Morningside Park, unfilled these 20 years.

<HEAD>AT&T Chief's Illness Raises Issue of Management Contingency Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James E. Olson's sudden absence from the helm of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. due to cancer has raised
unsettling questions about how companies prepare for abrupt
management changes and tragedies at the top.
   To a lesser extent, the episode also has underlined the
responsibility a public corporation faces not only to employees,
but shareholders in disclosing that a boss is ill or incapacitated.
Such information can affect stock values.
   Responding to press queries about Olson's rumored ill health,
AT&T said last Monday that the 62-year-old chairman and chief
executive officer was recuperating at home after colon cancer
surgery March 25. The telecommunication giant's stock fell 25 cents
a share to $27.87{ in heavy trading.
   Company officials said they had not promptly disclosed Olson's
disease because it wasn't clear at the time that he faced a
long-term incapacity.
   Moreover, they said, the delegation of authority in Olson's
absence was clearly understood because he had created a five-member
office of the chairman. Robert Allen, president and chief operating
officer, is running AT&T for now, and there is no question that
Olson's outline for its future remains unchanged.
   Despite the outwardly smooth transition in AT&T's case, such
crises almost always have an impact on companies, especially those
that aren't prepared for them, management experts say.
   ``There isn't much catastrophe preparation of that sort. It's
not seen as that consequential, especially in larger companies
where there is an obvious chain of command, like the government,''
said Leonard Sayles, a professor of management at Columbia Business
School.
   ``The more serious problem that should be taken into account is,
how do you reassure people, particularly at more senior levels,
that if there is a true disaster there are continuities?,'' Sayles
said. ``They need assurances that a successor has the same values
as a former CEO.''
   Some say the management style of an incapacitated boss also
plays an important role in how a company fares in his or her
absence. The most vulnerable companies are those run by managers
who don't relinquish authority.
   When entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc.'s autocratic chief
executive Lew Wasserman was hospitalized last summer, for example,
speculation swirled about his health and the company became a
takeover target, forcing it to take steps to thwart any unwelcome
suitors.
   Though Wasserman, 74, has given no indication he plans to
retire, he has since made clear that his successor would be Sidney
Sheinberg, president and chief operating officer, who has been with
the company for 14 years.
   A serious management crisis befell Gulf & Western Industries
Inc. five years ago when its hands-on leader Charles Bluedorn died
of a heart attack while returning from a business trip. Nobody was
prepared to replace him.
   ``That corporation was totally thrown into a barrel of writhing
question marks,'' said Gerald Meyers, a management consultant and
former chairman of the defunct American Motors Corp. ``It took them
a long time to get sorted out.''
   Meyers, who has written a book titled ``When It Hits the Fan,''
detailing management crises and how to avoid them, estimated in a
telephone interview that only about 150 of the Fortune 500
industrial companies have good contingency plans in the event of a
chief's death or incapacity.
   ``It's just a part of that overall mentality that we carry
around with us,'' he said. ``We plan for success, we allow no
negative thoughts to invade our thinking and we get rid of people
who bring up the possibilities, as real as they may be, that we
could face difficulty. With that formula, it's a sure-fire
prescription for chaos if you face an event like that and you're
unprepared.''
   The impact of tragedy at the top is lessened considerably when
the burden of management is shared, as in AT&T's case.
   Another good example was the passage of power at Singer Co. when
its chairman and chief executive, Joseph B. Flavin, died suddenly
last October.
   Flavin, who had helped transform Singer from a sewing-machine
and furniture maker into a leading aerospace-electronics concern,
was replaced immediately by its president and chief operating
officer, William F. Schmied.
   ``There was nothing that went on in Singer in terms of a
management process that Bill Schmied hadn't been involved in.
That's the kind of thing most companies hope for,'' said Singer
spokesman Thomas L. Elliott. ``It was an exceedingly smooth
transition, though it was a shocking event for all of us.''

   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _An unexpected swelling of the February trade deficit frightened
the financial markets and resurrected fears of a weakened dollar,
inflation and higher interest rates. Stock prices fell sharply,
erasing much of their recent gains.
   _Oil prices leaped to the highest level of the year, reflecting
speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would be able to recruit help from outside producers to constrict
world supplies.
   _The government said retail sales surged 0.8 percent in March,
suggesting consumer spending has recovered from a post-crash
decline. Other economic indicators from the government showed
wholesale prices jumped in March, suggesting higher inflation, and
growth of both inventories and industrial production slowed.
   _Federal officials began an unprecedented probe into heavily
indebted Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company, to
determine whether it was financially sound and committed to running
safe planes.
   _Finance ministers of the seven major industrialized reaffirmed
their commitment to stabilize the dollar. But the pledge by the
United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and
Italy had little effect.
   _A poll of more than 1,000 top executives indicated their
confidence in the U.S. economy is recovering in the aftermath of
the stock market's collapse six months ago. The Conference Board
business research concern said its measure of business confidence
rose to 51 after falling to a five-year low of 47 in the final
quarter of 1987. The measure reflects a scale of 0 to 100.
   _New York real estate mogul Harry Helmsley and his wife Leona,
one of the world's wealthiest couples, pleaded innocent to charges
they engaged in a $4 million tax evasion scam.
   _A truce was declared between entertainer Merv Griffin and
developer Donald Trump in their much-publicized battle for casino
conglomerate Resorts International Inc. The deal called for Griffin
to buy Resorts and most of its properties, while Trump will get the
Taj Mahal casino.
   _Among other takeover developments, Occidental Petroleum Corp.
agreed to acquire plastics maker Cain Chemical Inc. in a deal
valued at $2.2 billion; French publisher Hachette S.A. agreed to
buy U.S. consumer magazine publisher Diamandis Communications Inc.
for $712 million, Hachette's second U.S. acquisition this month;
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., agreed to sell its consumer finance
unit to American General Corp. for $685 million; textile giant J.P.
Stevens & Co.'s management recommended shareholder acceptance of a
$1.22 billion takeover bid by investor group Odyssey Partners; and
Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti failed to win shareholder
support in his takeover battle for the massive Belgian holding
company Societe Generale de Belgique SA.
   _A detailed assessment of the nation's business schools found
widespread complacency, poor planning and a lack of contact with
the business world. The 372-page report released at a national
convention of business schools was criticized by deans and
corporate officials.

<TEXT>
   Halfway between the 1987 crash and the 1988
election, Wall Street finds itself at an uneasy crossroads.
   In the view of many analysts, just about all the standard
signals these days seem to be pointing toward higher interest
rates, tighter credit, and a tough setting for a stock market that
is still feeling aftershocks from the collapse last fall.
   The economic news lately has produced a series of
disappointments only a bear could love.
   Hopes for continued progress on the nation's trade problems were
dashed on Thursday when the Commerce Department reported that the
trade deficit unexpectedly widened in February.
   Investors were especially unhappy to see that, while exports
remained strong, imports grew even more rapidly.
   Then, on Friday, the Labor Department said the Producer Price
Index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March for its largest
increase in 11 months.
   All that seemed to give the Federal Reserve two significant
reasons to think about new steps toward tightening credit _ not
only to support the dollar in foreign exchange, but also to keep
the domestic economy from heating up to an inflationary pitch.
   Even before the latest economic developments, the Fed had shown
signs that it was pulling in the reins a bit in its credit policy.
   Allen Sinai, economist at Boston Co. and Economic Advisors Inc.,
described this as an apparent strategy of ``earlier preventitive
action'' intended to forestall the need for more drastic measures
later on.
   But Sinai added that the Fed might have trouble making this
approach work. ``Throughout post-war history,'' he said, ``when the
economy and inflation have picked up momentum, small changes of
interest rates have not had much effect.''
   In the crush of adverse news on trade and inflation, the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials fell 76.26 points to 2,013.93 in
the past week after touching new post-crash highs on Monday and
Tuesday.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 5.03 to
147.00; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
fell 7.93 to 373.90, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index decreased 1.25 to 299.24.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 183.57 million shares a day,
against 170.89 million the week before.
   With Alan Greenspan, a Republican, at the helm, some say the Fed
might be predisposed to keep credit conditions relaxed enough to
avoid hurting the GOP's chances in November.
   But David Levine at Wall Street's Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
says the historical record contains nothing to support this case.
   ``Detailed analysis of the year preceding the last eight
presidential elections shows that the Fed has not hesitated to push
interest rates upward provided that the underlying conditions
warranted such a move,'' he observed.
   Analysts also point out the Fed doesn't operate in a vacuum. If
bond traders think conditions warrant higher interest rates, they
will push rates higher without waiting for any signal from the
central bank.
   Even if it were operating on political motives, some Wall
Streeters believe, the Fed might be inclined to lean in the
direction of tighter credit right now.
   One risk of an overly stimulative credit policy, they say, would
be a new boom-bust cycle in the stock market making headlines just
before the election.

   The Associated Press erroneously
reported April 9 that Tandy Corp. had begun a major push to
increase sales to large companies last year by creating separate

   Tandy began opening separate computer centers in 1978 and did
the $80 million in renovations on outlets other than the computer
centers. The company has 4,900 outlets instead of 8,500 as stated.
In addition, Tandy said it does not intend to sell computers made
by the recently acquired Grid Systems Corp. through Radio Shack
marketing channels.

<HEAD>Inflation Shows First Jump of Year in March Wholesale Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 7 percent in March,
according to a government report that heightened fears of inflation
and sent interest rates up to levels not seen in three months.
   Market reaction to the bad news was restrained Friday. Although
interest rates climbed back to January levels, the dollar held its
ground with the support of central banks, and stock prices were
mixed.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks dropped 101.46
points on Thursday, but rose 8.29 on Friday even though stocks in
the broader market were down by a 9-to-5 ratio.
   The Labor Department said its producer price index for finished
goods rose 0.6 percent last month, marking the biggest increase
since April 1987 and more than erasing a 0.2 percent decline in
February.
   Energy and food prices shot up, as did wholesale prices for a
wide marketbasket of other consumer goods and capital equipment.
   The price report came on the heels of Thursday's surprising
Commerce Department report that the nation's trade deficit expanded
by $1.4 billion to $13.8 billion in February.
   The twin reports raised speculation that the Federal Reserve
would act to curb inflation fears and support the dollar by
tightening credit, which would raise interest rates.
   Lawrence Hunter, an economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
expressed fears that the Fed will ``overreact to perceived
inflationary pressures that some see in the recent data'' and
stymie economic growth
   ``Oversteering in the face of monthly price swings can only feed
fears of inflation,'' Hunter said, referring to figures that show
the annual wholesale price increases of just 3.1 percent when
averaged over the past three months.
   However, Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economist
who specializes in wholesale price trends, said increases in April
will match, if not exceed, those in March.
   ``This isn't a one-month aberration,'' Ratajczak said. ``Strong
increases in raw material prices that have been going on for six
months are widening and spreading. It's not runaway inflation, but
it's a little worrying.''
   In another report Friday, the Commerce Department said that
businesses planning to increase their capital spending by 8 percent
this year after raising it by only 1.7 percent in 1987.
   The Commerce report reflected increasing optimism about the
economy among businessmen who, when last surveyed in December, said
they planned to increase their capital spending by 7.3 percent this
year.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial
production edged up just 0.1 percent in March. Analysts said that
report was the only indication that the economy is not overheating
following a long string of data suggesting that it is.

   Larry Speakes slalomed through 2,000 press
briefings during his six-year stint as White House spokesman, but
he made a major public relations miscalculation when it came to his
own foray into self-promotion.
   The president's former PR man quit his lucrative job as chief
spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Co. on Friday following the
revelation in his upcoming book, ``Speaking Out,'' that he
concocted quotes for President Reagan.
   Fabricating quotes is not an offense of such magnitude to lock
Speakes out of the public relations profession altogether, but his
credibility has been severely damaged and it probably will be
reflected in his paycheck, PR people said.
   One New York public relations executive, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said clients would be very reluctant to
hire Speakes because he showed ``a certain amount of
insensitivity'' in confession to the creation of quotes.
   ``If we went out and said we did this or that for a client, it
would make anyone else look at us twice before trusting us with
confidential information,'' the executive said.
   Industry insiders said Speakes is going to have a hard time
matching his $200,000-plus Merrill Lynch salary.
   ``There aren't that many $250,000 jobs around in my
profession,'' said Howard J. Rubenstein, president of an
influential New York-based public relations firm that bears his
name.
   But because Speakes remains a ``major name in the business with
powerful connections,'' he probably won't be standing in
unemployment lines, said Pamela Talbot, manager of the Chicago
office of the public relations firm Daniel J. Edelman Inc.
   She predicted Speakes would find a job, ``but not one with as
high a profile or at such a high level.''
   Lawrence W. Fisher, president and chief executive of the Los
Angeles public relations firm Braun & Co., agreed that Speakes
``will not have any trouble finding a job _ but maybe not in the
communications field.''
   Meanwhile, industry executives recommend Speakes jump on the
lecture circuit, where he can make a fine living ``just like Spiro
Agnew,'' one insider said.
   Ultimately, his peers predicted, Speakes will be absolved, just
as Richard Nixon and Gary Hart regained some public dignity.
   Quitting Merrill Lynch ``will probably hype sales of his book
and that's fortunate for him, because it may be a long time before
he finds a job as lucrative as the one he gave up,'' said one New
York-based public relations executive, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

   The phony quotes that Larry Speakes ascribed to
President Reagan while running the White House press office have
come back to shatter his 14-month-old Wall Street career as chief
spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Co.
   The 48-year-old senior vice president of communications at the
investment giant quit Friday after creating an uproar by admitting
in a new book that he twice concocted quotes for Reagan.
   The confession had raised serious questions about his
credibility as a communicator for Merrill Lynch, which like other
Wall Street firms have become extremely sensitive to their public
image since the stock crash six months ago.
   Sources inside Merrill Lynch, who spoke on the condition they
not be identified, said the company's senior management was alarmed
over the impact of Speakes' disclosure and relieved when he told
them he was resigning.
   ``We took the attitude that he, being the communicator, knew
very well what this torrent of publicity was doing to him as our
chief spokesman and the image of Merrill Lynch as its chief
spokesman,'' one source said.
   Speakes said in a brief written statement that his decision was
``the best course of action for Merrill Lynch and for me
personally. Merrill Lynch is a great firm and the industry leader,
and I've enjoyed being part of it.''
   Merrill Lynch said in the statement: ``We accept Larry Speakes'
resignation with regret. Larry has made a significant contribution
to our firm during his time here, and we wish him well in every
regard.''
   Fred Yager, a Merrill Lynch spokesman, declined to elaborate on
Speakes' resignation, saying: ``I think the statement speaks for
itself. I'm not going to veer from the statement.''
   Speakes was not in Merrill Lynch's New York headquarters when
the announcement was made and company officials said they did not
know his whereabouts.
   He joined Merrill Lynch with much fanfare in February 1987,
earning an annual salary that sources said tripled the $77,400 he
made at the White House. He oversaw a staff of about 70 people with
responsibility over Merrill Lynch's press relations, corporate
advertising and in-house communications.
   The controversy began Monday when Speakes disclosed that in his
upcoming book ``Speaking Out'' he recounted two occasions when he
attributed to Reagan quotes that the president never said.
   ``In restrospect, it was clearly wrong to take such liberties,''
he wrote in the book. But, he added, ``I had been able to spruce up
the president's image by taking a bit of liberty with my P.R. man's
license.''
   In one instance, Speakes recalled, he quoted Reagan as saying
after Soviet gunners shot down a Korean Air Lines passenger jet in
1983 that the incident didn't pose a Soviet-U.S. problem, but a
``Soviet versus the world problem.''
   Speakes said that comment really came from Secretary of State
George Shultz. Speakes said he also credited Reagan with some
suggestions for possible retaliatory measures, which also had been
made by Shultz.
   In the other instance, Speakes said, he quoted Reagan as telling
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev during their Geneva summit,
``There is much that divides us, but I believe the world breathes
easier because we are talking here together.''
   He said in the book that he and a press aide, Mark Weinberg,
concocted this quotation.
   The disclosures created an uproar among the present White House
press office staff and was criticized by a broad range of
professionals in the public relations business, who said it damaged
his credibility.
   Although Speakes said he had told Reagan about the phony quotes,
Reagan denied it Wednesday and expressed anger over what he called
a ``kiss & tell'' piece of fiction. Reagan said ``no comment''
Friday when asked for a reaction to Speakes' resignation.
   Speakes' successor Marlin Fitzwater, who had denounced Speakes
earlier in the week for the bogus quotes, told reporters Friday,
``I'm sorry for him, personally.'' Fitzwater said he would comment
no further.
   Asked for reaction to his resignation, some public relations
executives said he might have trouble finding another prestigious
PR job.
   ``Credibility is requirement number one in this business. When
you have lost your credibility you have lost a hell of a lot,''
said Lawrence W. Fisher, president and chief executive of Braun &
Co. in Los Angeles.

   United Airlines has begun to put the squeeze on
frequent-flier freebies.
   Alarmed by the mushrooming popularity of the bonus programs and
their potential financial impact, the Chicago-based United
announced new restrictions Friday that could be imitated by other
major U.S. airlines.
   The frequent-flier plans reward passengers with free tickets or
upgrades to first class after they have flown a set number of
miles. United's new program sets up a two-tier system of travel
awards.
   On the one hand, it increases the mileage that must be
accumulated in order to fly free without restrictions. At the same
time, the program creates a new category called ``saver miles,''
allowing travelers to qualify for free flights with fewer miles
earned than before _ but with restrictions on the bonus tickets.
   ``The frequent-flier programs were getting out of control and,
quite frankly, they were heading toward extinction,'' said United
spokesman Dan Sheehy. ``We wanted to bring some logic and order to
the program.''
   Under United's current system, for example, a passenger can get
a free round-trip coach ticket to Hawaii after flying 35,000 miles
with the carrier. With the new plan, the mileage requirement rises
to 60,000 for a normal, unrestricted ticket to Hawaii. With 30,000
miles in credits, a flier can get a restricted free ticket.
   A limited number of the restricted tickets will be available for
use on each United flight, and they cannot be used during holiday
periods.
   On the plus side, United is allowing frequent fliers to transfer
their travel awards to other people, while currently they can only
be given to relatives.
   The number of awards available has been reduced from 140 to only
34.
   ``We're giving a little and we're taking away a little,'' Sheehy
said. The airline, a subsidiary of Allegis Corp., has about 4.5
million members in its frequent flier program.
   Many observers had expected United to make even more drastic
cuts in its program, after one of its senior executives said in a
speech in early March that the airline was considering imposing
restrictions. John Zeeman, executive vice president for marketing
and planning, had said the options under review included requiring
that travel awards be redeemed by a certain deadline, and even
eliminating free trips and providing only first-class upgrades
instead.
   Many other airlines have recently slapped restrictions on their
bonus programs _ most notably by limiting the number of free
tickets for any one flight.
   Mike Ribero, vice president of marketing programs for Eastern
Airlines, said Eastern is studying possible changes to its program,
operated jointly with Continental Airlines, like Eastern a
subsidiary of giant Texas Air Corp.
   American Airlines spokesman Al Becker said the carrier _ ranked
No. 2 after United _ also is studying the issue.
   Delta Air Lines, the third largest, doesn't plan to make any
changes in its program, said spokesman Jim Lundy.
   The U.S. airline industry is facing a staggering revenue loss if
the estimated 8 million people enrolled in frequent-flier programs
start redeeming their bonuses and bumping paying passengers. The
accumulated value of those bonuses is around $1.24 billion,
according to Julius Maldutis, senior airline analyst for investment
firm Salomon Brothers Inc.
   That compares with total industry revenue of around $46.7
billion in 1985, $50.5 billion in 1986 and just over $60 billion
last year.
