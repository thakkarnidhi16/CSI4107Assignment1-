<HEAD>House Approves Ban on Disposal of Sewage Sludge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Wednesday to bar authorities
in New York and New Jersey from disposing sewage sludge in the
Atlantic Ocean after 1991.
   The measure, passed by a voice vote, would impose stiff fines
for any dumping after Dec. 31, 1991. The fines are aimed at making
the dumping prohibitively expensive, and the penalty fees would be
used to pay for alternatives.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said the bill was ``a major
breakthrough in reclaiming our oceans and shores. This legislation
gives local sewage authorities the clear message that they must
find alternatives to ocean dumping _ not sometime in the distant
future, but right now.''
   President Reagan is expected to sign the bill, which is a
compromise between differing sludge-dumping bills passed by the
Senate in August and the House earlier this month.
   Nine agencies in New York and New Jersey dump about 8 million
tons of sludge a year at a site about 106 miles east of New Jersey.
Another site 12 miles offshore was closed in 1987.
   The new bill would set a fee of $100 per ton of sludge dumped
beginning Jan. 1, and the dumpers would be expected to negotiate
with federal authorities toward a timetable to end their dumping.
   Those that cannot work out a deal would see their fees rise to
$200 a ton by the end of 1991.
   Starting in 1992, penalties starting at $600 per ton would be
added to the fees. The penalties would rise by 11 percent a year
for continuing violators, and eventually would total tens of
millions of dollars.
   In 1978, Congress set a 1981 deadline to stop ocean sludge
dumping, but New York sued and got the ban suspended, saying the
deadline would be impossible to meet. However, a bipartisan
coalition of East Coast lawmakers worked in favor of a ban.

   Bill Hipple, a reporter whose career spanned
five decades working for Trans-Radio Press, the Honolulu Star
Bulletin, The Associated Press and Newsweek, died Friday of cancer.
He was 74.
   He was greeting cruise ships for the Honolulu Star Bulletin when
the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Hipple quickly left the islands
to begin working as a war correspondent for AP and Newsweek
magazine.
   He landed with American forces on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Guam and
Bougainville.
   With Newsweek, Hipple interviewed the two biggest names in the
Pacific Theater, Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and Gen. Douglas A.
MacArthur. Those interview coups resulted in a White House summons.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Hipple to relate what
Nimitz and MacArthur, who made a point of avoiding each other,
might have said about their sometimes-strained relationship.
   After the war, Hipple became northern European director of
public relations for American Overseas Airlines, and when those
routes were sold to Pan American Airways, he joined American

<HEAD>Dukakis Still Searching for Convincing Argument to Sway Voters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With less than three weeks left, Michael
Dukakis seems to be still searching for something that has escaped
him all fall: A compelling reason for voters to toss out the
Republicans and turn to him.
   Dukakis has jumped from theme to theme in his search for an
economic message that resonates with the American voters. ``Swiss
cheese economy,'' ``bring prosperity home,'' ``middle-class
squeeze,'' and ``Making America No. 1'' have all had their moments
as staples in his speeches.
   Each has been an attempt to capsulize what he is offering the
American voters and to give voters a reason to turn to the
candidate who represents change.
   The Democratic presidential nominee's campaign has been
frustrated so far, however, in seeing his messages fail to register
as Republican George Bush succeeded in painting him as a
traditional, northern liberal.
   Dukakis has settled for now on an appeal to economic
nationalism, borrowing rhetoric from former Democratic rival
Richard Gephardt in hitting the Republicans on the trade deficit.
   It is an appeal some Democrats have long advised Dukakis to make
_ but one, they say, he has seemed reluctant to take on after
shunning protectionism in the primaries against Gephardt.
   Dukakis aides say their plan all along was to make their case on
economic issues, depicting Bush as the candidate of the wealthy and
privileged. But there is an urgency, almost desperation now as
polls show Dukakis slipping farther behind after their final
debate, and the clock running out.
   ``He has to give people a reason to vote for him in the final
three weeks,'' said Dukakis adviser Francis O'Brien. ``That's the
next step.''
   Dukakis' inability to make a forceful case is bound up in the
problems of running as the candidate of change at a time of
relative peace and prosperity.
   As Bush has succeeded in running as the heir to President
Reagan, Dukakis has been pointing to economic unease about the
future, based on mounting deficits and the trade imbalance. But as
in 1984, voters haven't seemed to share the concern, and Bush has
portrayed Dukakis as representing threatening and uncertain change.
   ``He's had difficulty there, and you have to have some sympathy
for him,'' said Larry Sabato, University of Virginia political
scientist.
   ``It's a time of peace and prosperity for all practical
purposes. ... And you have a natural heir apparent to the
administration that's produced peace and prosperity. That is a
tough combination to beat.''
   Worse from Dukakis' point of view, the election is coming at a
time when the unemployment rate is at a low and public approval of
Reagan's performance is at a high point.
   ``He's made the case that he offers some interesting new
politics, but I don't think he's given people a strong case to vote
for him as the candidate of change,'' said William Schneider,
analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
   Dukakis has also been frustrated in seeing the debate turn on
issues raised forcefully by Bush, and by Bush's powerful television
advertisements. They include accusations that Dukakis is soft on
crime, weak on defense, and in the South and West, that he would
advocate gun control.
   Dukakis has been getting plenty of advice as Democrats see their
best shot at retaking the White House slipping away.
   ``He needs to tell people this has been a terrible campaign ...
that there are issues where they have fundamental differences that
haven't been addressed,'' said Seattle Mayor Charles Royer, a
supporter who believes Dukakis will carry Washington state. ``He
needs to be telling people what he will do and what he's about, as
he did at the Democratic National Convention.''
   Dukakis has been urged by some to buy a block of network
television time, 30 minutes or so, and hope a dramatic speech on
the economy could turn things around.
   But he also has been assailed within his own party for failing
to assert himself more forcefully.
   ``He's got to show some passion, commitment, leadership,'' said
Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark. ``He may have made an A-plus in
political science, but so far he hasn't passed politics.''

<HEAD>Underground Report Warns of Ecological Catastrophe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's industrialization, the absence
of environmental protection measures and official carelessless
spell ecological disaster for that communist nation and its 23
million citizens, an underground study says.
   A copy of the 22-page, hand-written report was received this
week by The Associated Press. The study was signed by 13 members of
the little-known Romanian Democratic Action, a small, underground
opposition group reportedly established in 1985.
   Western analysts said the survey, written this year, was the
first concrete attempt to define a platform for a possible
ecological opposition in Romania.
   Although its authors had no access to official statistics, the
study contains many facts and details in contrast to scant and
sporadic information in the state-run media, which usually avoid
discussing ecological failures.
   It said Romania's economic crisis ``threatens to become an
ecological catastrophe,'' with the Bucharest authorities pursuing
``a primitive concept of intensive and pitiless exploitation of the
soil and nature.''
   The survey denounced the regime of President Nicolae Ceausescu
for allegedly ignoring the general deterioration of the environment.
   It reported heavy pollution in the metallurgical centers of
Galati in eastern Romania, Hunedoara in the west and Tirgoviste in
the south.
   ``The effort to write off at any cost Romania's foreign debt
(now estimated at about $4 billion) has led to the aging of
industrial installations,'' said the study.
   ``That's why the industrial complexes, left at the level of the
1970s, are big energy spenders and polluters.''
   ``A huge, red-colored cloud hangs day and night over
Tirgoviste,'' it went on, noting that an attempt to provide a
filtering system for the local alloyed-steel combine was a ``total
failure.''
   Similarly, the chemical industry poses a ``particularly high
risk'' for the environment, it said.
   Six major accidents took place at a pharmaceutical plant in
Bucharest in the past 10 years, followed by ``considerable leaks of
unidentified toxic gases which alarmed residents'' living in the
area, said the report.
   ``Nobody said anything and no measures of any kind were taken,''
the report said.
   A dense chlorine gas that repeatedly escaped in recent years
from a chemical complex in Giurgiu in southern Romania drifted over
the northern Bulgarian city of Ruse, causing a rift between the two
Soviet bloc allies.
   The Bulgarian BTA news agency said in February that the sharp
smell of chlorine made breathing difficult, forcing people to clamp
handkerchiefs over their mouths and race for shelter.
   In an attempt to stop what Bulgarian media called ``an
ecological disaster'' in Ruse, the two countries last fall set up a
joint commissiom to take measures toward ending the chlorine
pollution in the border area.
   It was not known if the problem still exists in the area.
   The report said weapons factories at Mirsa and Zarnesti in
central Transylvania pose a ``constant danger'' for the local
population, following ``catastrophic explosions'' in 1980, 1983 and
1984.
   The study appeared to confirm unofficial accounts of the
accidents which purportedly led to the death of hundreds of people
and triggered ``enormous leaks of chlorine and a mixture of
chemical solvents.''
   It said the ecological balance is being destroyed in the
vicinity of Romania's paper factories for apparent lack of filters
and other preventive installations, damaging the health of nearby
residents.
   According to the survey, Romania's coal-fired power plants,
using low-grade coal, ``spew hundreds of thousands of tons'' of
toxic gases and residues into the atmosphere.
   Abuse of chemical fertilizers and insecticides in Romania's
state-owned agriculture reportedly led to ``advanced'' land
deterioration and erosion in some areas.
   Even Ceausescu publicly complained in February about ``overuse
of herbicides and of various chemical products to combat various
diseases in agriculture,'' following official reports about
livestock deaths resulting from contaminated fodder.
   Western observers and Romanian sources said it was the first
time Ceausescu warned of the dangers of ``chemicalized
agriculture,'' a long-standing practice of Communist planners to
increase crop yields.
   The report said water pollution was also a serious problem, and
many rivers have been turned into virtual sewers.
   Drinking water is already reported rationed in many towns. To
compensate for lack of adequate filters ``large amounts of
chlorine, above admissible doses,'' are being used, it said.
   Improvised dumping sites are being tolerated, toxic substances
are thrown directly into rivers, and car batteries, lubricants and
expired drugs are being indiscriminately dumped, the report said.

<HEAD>Bush Paints Improving Rural Picture; Dukakis Sees Economy Still
Ailing</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Another in a series on key issues in the presidential race.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Many American farmers have endured tough times
during the Reagan era, capped by a withering drought that played
havoc with crops in this election year.
   But that same drought has driven up prices and mopped up
surpluses, and that could strengthen Republican George Bush's
appeal for farm votes that many politicians thought once were
locked up for Michael Dukakis and the Democrats.
   In agriculture, Bush sees a rural America on the mend and headed
for greater prosperity built around a free-market philosophy.
   Dukakis sees a rural economy still seriously ailing and in need
of government help to support the family farmer and guarantee
reasonable prices for crops.
   ``The difference between the two is Bush is happy. We think
there's a crisis still out there,'' said Ted Mondale, the Dukakis
Midwest political director.
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., a Bush agricultural adviser, called
the Dukakis program ``a big mystery that is causing anxiety in farm
country.''
   ``They seem to be in favor of massive cutbacks in production,''
Cochran charged.
   The Democratic nominee has not endorsed the stringent production
controls that two farm state Democrats, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, have sought. Their bill died in
the 100th Congress.
   Mondale said Dukakis supports the concept, but not the
particulars, of the Harkin-Gephardt legislation.
   Dukakis, in his position paper on agriculture, said U.S. farm
policy ``must include a combination of supply management and
reasonable price supports in a way that makes it possible for
family farmers to earn a decent living from the land.''
   While Bush often refers derisively to Dukakis' ``supply
management'' ideas, the 1985 Farm Bill that Bush lavishly praises
also gave the government supply management powers, and Mondale said
the Reagan administration's price supports and set-asides were all
supply management tools.
   Bush has said the bipartisan 1985 Farm Bill is just beginning to
pay off for farmers. It has led to lower commodity prices which,
coupled with the drop in the dollar's value, helped boost farm
exports 18 percent last year, he says. And he boasts that net cash
farm income last year was a record $57 billion.
   ``Rural America has been strongly tested in recent years.
However, I believe we have seen the bottom and are headed back
up,'' says Bush.
   The vice president says he would press ahead with efforts ``to
phase out over a reasonable period those subsidies that distort
agricultural trade if, and only if, other countries do the same.''
But he promises to ``preserve a true safety net to ensure the
viability of the family farm and rural America.''
   Dukakis says farmers and ranchers are ``being squeezed at both
ends,'' facing lower commodity prices and a shrinking share of each
food dollar (down from 32 percent in 1976 to 25 percent now).
   ``Still lower prices are not the answer,'' the Democrat argues.
``Our present policy seems to be guided by a desire to drive
commodity prices lower and lower in the hope of some future
recovery of lost markets.''
   Dukakis promises to target farm program benefits to family
farmers ``who need them most.''
   Dukakis hopes to narrow the federal deficit by reducing farm
subsidies. In his last debate with Bush, the Massachusetts governor
said he was ``sure'' a Dukakis administration could ``give our farm
families a decent income without spending $20-to-$25 billion a year
in farm subsidies.''
   Farm subsidies shot up from $5 billion in 1980 under the Carter
administration to $25 billion in 1986 under Reagan. This year the
administration and Congress came up with nearly $4 billion in
emergency drought aid.
   But the drought-fed higher crop prices also reduce the need for
government price supports.
   Mondale, son of the former vice president, said ruefully that
Bush was claiming credit for higher prices and exports that really
belongs ``to the weather and the Democrats.'' Farm state
legislators, most of them Democrats, had to ``shove the export
enhancement program down the Reagan administration's throat,'' he
said.
   Bush constantly reminds rural audiences of the Carter
administration's 1979 grain embargo against the Soviet Union and
implies that Dukakis is liable to try another. Bush promises he
won't ``use farmers and ranchers and their families as foreign
policy pawns.''
   But Dukakis says, ``In no instance would I impose an embargo.''
   Dukakis says the productivity of U.S. farmers ``should be viewed
as a blessing, not a curse. Surplus farm commodities should be
better used to feed hungry people both at home and aborad.'' He
favors barter with countries ``that want our farm goods but don't
have the needed currency.''
   Bush has promised to devote an economic summit meeting with the
major U.S. allies to the subject of agriculture.
   Both candidates support wider use of ethanol, the alternative
fuel made from gasoline and alcohol.
   Dukakis has also promised help for ailing rural hospitals and
other steps to revitalize rural communities.
   Bush suggests rural enterprise zones to help distressed
communities.
   Whether rural America perceives its own glass as half-full or
half-empty may decide which candidate wins the farm state vote.
   ``There's a lot of optimism in agriculture today compared with
several years ago when huge surpluses were hanging over the
market,'' said Cochran. With inflation under control and interest
rates at least stable, ``farmers are feeling they may be able to
work their way clear of some indebtedness.''
   Mondale said, ``The key to this election is whether we can get
Mike Dukakis' ag program out so that people on Main Street
understand it and see that it's a reasonable one.''

   A man who was starting a trash fire says he
accidentally ignited his cat, which ran into his barn ``like a ball
of fire'' and torched the structure.
   Wendell Lane saved his cattle from the blaze Monday but
apparently not the cat. The animal was not found after the fire,
said Lane, who feared it did not survive.
   ``I was starting a trash fire out back and poured just a little
bit of kerosene to get the fire going,'' he said. ``Somehow our cat
was in the trashpile. ... He took off like a ball of fire and
headed straight for the open door of the barn.''
   Lane found the cat rolling in hay trying to put the flames out.
   Lane tried to put out the fire with an extinguisher and a garden
hose, said Fire Chief Patrick McGinley. When the flames got ahead
of him, he took his cattle out and called the fire department.
   The blazes destroyed the wooden barn, including all his winter
hay for livestock.

   Michael Dukakis is adding bodies to his field
operations in target states and tougher rhetoric to his speeches
and television ads in hopes of overtaking Republican George Bush in
the three weeks before voters choose the next president.
   Dukakis aides said Tuesday that dozens of workers at the
Democratic campaign's Boston headquarters are being assigned to
states for the final push. Joining them will be more than 1,300
volunteers recruited in Washington.
   The new infusion of personnel comes at a time when Dukakis is
adding fresh attacks on Bush to his speeches.
   ``George Bush cares about the people on Easy Street,'' Dukakis
said Tuesday in Michigan. ``I care about the people on Main Street.
He's on their side. I'm on your side.''
   That rhetoric fits with Dukakis' attempt to portray Bush as a
candidate of the rich, a theme the Democratic nominee supports with
a scornful reference to ``George Bush's one new idea'' _ a tax
break for the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.
   Dukakis also has decided to attack Bush over the airwaves with a
new ad, set to begin airing tonight, that shows the vice president
meeting with suspected drug trafficker Manuel Antonio Noriega. The
ad scoffs both at Bush's job as the Reagan administration's leader
in the drug war and his proposal to give Dan Quayle that job in a
Bush administration.
   With polls giving Bush a double-digit lead, senior Dukakis aides
met with headquarters staffers Tuesday to reassure them victory was
within reach and to discuss transfers.
   At that meeting, senior Dukakis aides said the campaign will
focus on about 25 states in which Dukakis either is leading or
remains competitive, according to a source who attended the session.
   Jack Corrigan, dirctor of operations for Dukakis, said in a
telephone interview that about 60 percent of the Boston staffers
and volunteers would be reassigned to the field. He could not
provide a specific number.
   Also shifted into a new role was Marcia Hale, who was helping
prepare for a transition to a Dukakis presidency until being tapped
to help direct, from Boston, political activities in Southern
states in which Dukakis is competitive, principally Georgia and
Louisiana.
   Wendy Sherman, who runs the campaign's Washington office, said
she has recruited more than 1,300 volunteers to assist the field
effort in target states on projects ranging from precinct politics
to helping with phone banks and distributing campaign literature.
Many of them are congressional aides with prior election
experience, she said.
   Dukakis' closing strategy also calls on the candidate to make
the most of opportunities to appear on television news programs.
Also being considered, according to sources, is the purchase of
network television time for a direct Dukakis appeal to voters.
   While that plan is reviewed the campaign is adding to its
repertoire of paid TV ads.
   After nearly a week of airing two positive ads featuring a
conversational Dukakis, the Democratic campaign is launching a
direct assault on Bush and running mate Quayle.
   The new ad blasts both Bush's role in the Reagan
administration's anti-drug effort and the vice president's promise
to put Dan Quayle in charge of that effort if elected.
   ``Cocaine traffic up 300 percent,'' the narrator says while a
photo of cocaine bundles flashes on TV screens.
   ``Panamanian drug lord Noriega kept on the payroll,'' the ad
continues as the Bush-Noriega photo appears. ``That's the Bush
record on fighting drugs.''
   The ad then features a clip of Quayle saying, ``I'm gonna be
coordinating the drug effort.''
   It ends with the narration: ``If George Bush couldn't handle the
job, how do you think Dan Quayle is going to do?''
   Additional network ads challenging Bush's record also are
planned, as is a flurry of commercials tailored for specific target
states, including Ohio, California and Texas, according to Dukakis
aides.

   Rep. Pat Swindall is portraying himself as a
modern day David facing a government Goliath as he prepares for
trial next Monday in Atlanta on a 10-count federal indictment
charging him with lying to a grand jury investigating money
laundering.
   ``It is a very simple case,'' Swindall said in an interview
Tuesday. ``It is called trial by ambush. They've had one year to
prepare their case. I'm going to go in and face the entire
resources of the IRS, the FBI and the Justice Department.''
   Swindall, a second-term Republican who is facing a tough
re-election fight in his suburban Atlanta district Nov. 8, was
indicted Monday on charges of lying to a federal grand jury. The
grand jury was hearing evidence gathered during a nationwide money
laundering ``sting'' operation by the Internal Revenue Service.
   He sought and was granted an expedited trial in hopes of
clearing his name before the election. He said that move forced him
to act as his own attorney, since no lawyer would be able to
prepare for the trial in just one week.
   Swindall said he has not tried a criminal case in seven years
and has tried only four criminal cases in his entire legal career.
In all four cases, he said, he was assisted by another lawyer.
   Swindall said he intends to call U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr
Jr. as a witness to explain why he waited until less than a month
before the election to seek an indictment based on grand jury
testimony given eight months earlier.
   While refusing to speculate on the Republican prosecutor's
motives, Swindall said his election-eve indictment indicates that
the government either has ``a very weak case ... or it's a very
political case.''
   ``I don't think I would have ever even been scrutinized but for
who I am,'' he said. ``If I were John Q. Citizen, I would not have
ever had to testify (before the grand jury). I could have told the
government to take their grand jury and stick it in their ear.''
   The perjury charges against Swindall stem from his grand jury
testimony about discussions he had last year with Atlanta
businessman Charles LeChasney and Michael Mullaney, an undercover
IRS agent posing as a money broker, about an $850,000 home mortgage
loan he was seeking.
   Swindall accepted a $150,000 check from LeChasney at one point
during the negotiations, but returned it uncashed three days later.
When LeChasney was indicted in January, Swindall said he contacted
the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta to tell them he had had
dealings with LeChasney.
   The indictment accuses Swindall of lying when he told the grand
jury he did not report the loan negotiations to authorities because
``I never satisfied myself of anything with respect to
criminality.''
   He also is accused of lying when he denied there had been
discussions about trying to conceal the trail of the money and when
he denied that Mullaney specifically informed him that source of
the loan could be illegal drug money.
   The charges carry a possible punishment of up to 50 years
imprisonment.
   When he returned to Washington on Tuesday following his
indictment Monday, Swindall received a letter from President Reagan
congratulating him on his 38th birthday.
   ``May your special day be filled with joy and may the year to
come bring you every happiness,'' Reagan wrote.

   Voters must provide the passion to elect
Michael Dukakis while the Democratic presidential nominee should
devote his attention to the issues, says former candidate Jesse
Jackson.
   ``The issue is not Dukakis' passion; it's Bush's lack of
compassion,'' Jackson told a rally Tuesday at Tulane University.
``When Dukakis talks about housing, energy, jobs, day care and the
rights of women _ he's going in the right direction. ... We the
people provide the passion. Let him provide the priorities.''
   The former contender for the Democratic nomination has come
under attack recently for his less than passionate support for his
party's ticket. Jackson, in a telephone interview earlier in the
day, said that it's absolutely false to say his support has been
less than strong.
   ``No Democrat since Atlanta has traveled more miles, spoken to
more people and registered more Democrats for the ticket than I
have,'' the Democratic runner-up said from his Chicago home.
   During the Tulane rally _ one of two New Orleans campus rallies
added to Jackson's schedule Tuesday night _ he listed an itinerary
of 18 appearances in 16 cities around the country.
   ``A week ago, my schedule was _ typical, but expresses my own
commitment and determination,'' said Jackson. ``I challenge you to
work, too.''
   Mark Goodin, a Bush spokesman in Washington, said Jackson has
done ``a tremendous disappearing act.''
   ``I think that's probably by design'' of Dukakis strategists,
Goodin said. ``If you're a liberal trying to run as a moderate,
Jesse Jackson, who doesn't hide his liberalism, is not a plus for
you.''
   In his speech, Jackson hit hard at Republican nominee George
Bush's stands on social issues and at his attacks on Dukakis as a
liberal and member of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``Why assume that those who want to change things are somehow
subversive?'' Jackson asked the crowd of 1,900 students at a
get-out-the-vote rally in the Tulane auditorium.
   Jackson's wholehearted support for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket is
considered essential in a handful of states where he won primaries,
especially those with heavy concentrations of blacks. Those include
Georgia and Louisiana, where the Democrats are still competitive.
   Jackson, in the earlier interview, said he was urging everyone
to do their part rather than judging anyone.
   ``We have 26 Democratic governors, 53 senators, 270 House
members and the majority of urban Democratic mayors,'' he said,
slightly misstating the numbers. ``If each of those leaders with
portfolio will pull their weight ... if they will cast their net
with this ticket ... we'll have enough votes to win.''
   He did single out the Democratic Leadership Council, which was
formed in 1983 to try to draw so-called ``Reagan Democrats'' back
to the fold. Members of that group influenced Dukakis' choice of
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as vice presidential nominee, Jackson said.
   ``This is the time for the DLC to make its presence felt,'' he
said.

   Freezing temperatures and shifting winds
combined to shut off all escape routes for three stranded whales
Tuesday as rescuers readied for a dangerous, go-for-broke attempt
to free the animals.
   The effort has become a race against time complicated by the
wind, bitter cold and shifting ice. The young California gray
whales early Tuesday were tired. At least one may have pneumonia.
Their barnacle-encrusted snouts were worn raw from grating on the
jagged ice surrounding their tiny breathing holes.
   At Prudhoe Bay, some 200 miles to the southeast, an Army
National Guard Skycrane helicopter was rigged to hook onto a
185-ton icebreaking hovercraft barge owned by VECO Inc. for the
tricky journey across the desolate Arctic Ocean to reach the whales.
   But late Tuesday, the trip was put on hold until Wednesday
morning. The journey was delayed when the barge became stuck in the
ice, then for refueling before the barge was moved a short distance
late Tuesday.
   Col. Tom Carroll of the Alaska Army National Guard, said the
barge was pulled from the dock but it moved slowly.
   Mike Haller, a National Guard spokesman, said crews would work
through the night to lighten the barge by removing fuel.
   ``We're looking at seeing if it makes things a little
smoother,'' he said. ``We'll go after it again at first light
tomorrow.''
   The whales, whose length ranges from 24 to 30 feet, became
trapped nearly two weeks ago while migrating south to warmer
waters. They were hemmed in by new ice 18 miles northeast of this
Inupiat Eskimo village. The whales are in shallow water only a few
hundred feet offshore.
   The trip from Prudhoe Bay to Point Barrow is expected to take
25-40 hours and crews must be careful, authorities said. If the tow
cable were to snap and wrap in the helicopter rotors it could be
disastrous.
   President Reagan telephoned the commander of the operation to
offer his support, telling him that Americans' ``hearts are with
you and our prayers are also with you.''
   ``I just wanted to tell you that everybody down here, their
hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you,'' Reagan
told Carroll.
   Marvin King, VECO chief of operations at Prudhoe Bay, said the
barge was ready to go Tuesday, but would not budge. Workers freed
the barge later Tuesday.
   The helicopter cannot lift the barge, said Haller. The Skycranes
can only lift about 22,500 pounds, but when the barge is on its air
cushion, the aircraft will be towing only about 18,000 pounds, he
said.
   The barge pulverizes ice with a combination of its weight and
the vibration from its engines.
   The effort had been scheduled to begin Monday, but was delayed
when it was discovered the barge needed repairs.
   A National Weather Service analysis of the ice in the Point
Barrow area Monday provided little hope for the animals.
   A satellite photo shows the nearest open water is 200 miles to
the west, in the Chukchi Sea, he said. The next ice analysis was
scheduled for Wednesday.
   Last week, the ice around the whales' breathing holes was so
thin that biologists did not dare walk on it. By early Tuesday, the
ice was 18-24 inches thick. The California gray whales, despite
their size and mass, have shown no inclination to bull their way
through the ice pack.
   Haller said authorities were aware of the analysis but were
going ahead with the attempt. ``We're committed to this,'' Haller
said. ``We're going to go ahead and see what happens.''
   As the world watched and waited, biologists and North Slope
residents worked with chainsaws to keep the whales' small breathing
holes open. One of the holes is 24-by-20 feet; the other, 24-by-10.
   Biologists said they were overwhelmed by the interest shown in
the trapped whales. The drama has prompted scores of calls from
people with ideas to free the animals. They ranged from using
explosives or dropping bowling balls to break the ice to netting
the animals for transport elsewhere.
   ``Every year, probably dozens of grays drown or are crushed by
the ice, but nobody ever knows about it,'' said North Slope
biologist Craig George.
   To underscore his point, 20 miles offshore, the flipper of a
bowhead whale is frozen in the ice and has attracted more than a
half-dozen foraging polar bears. Biologists said they were
surprised the bears had not found the stranded gray whales. The
scientists have begun carrying shotguns onto the ice, just in case
the bears get lucky.
   Nobody was sure how long the whales could last. They have been
swimming against a current since they were trapped. Exhaustion
could kill them, but food is not a likely problem, biologists said.
   The gray whales feed on the bottom, stirring up organisms that
they filter through finger-like projections called baleen. ``These
guys are kind of the vacuum cleaners of the whale family,'' George
said. ``But all members of the great whale family have the ability
to fast for long periods.''
   He said the whales had just completed their summer feeding
period and should have started their ordeal in peak condition. Gray
whales usually do not feed much as they migrate south, he said.
   The whales were spotted because they were trapped relatively
close to shore and biologists stationed in the area were alerted.
   The population of endangered California gray whales numbers
about 20,000 and has been growing at an annual average of 2.5
percent for the past decade, authorities said.
   The whales spend their winters in the warm waters off Mexico and
Southern California.

<HEAD>Dukakis Campaign Kicks Off Quayle-Drug Czar Ad; Bush Releases
`Tank' Ad</HEAD>

   Dan Quayle, drug czar?
   ``We think that's a fairly frightening thought that people need
to be reminded of,'' says Dave D'Alessandro, ad chief for
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   The Dukakis campaign scheduled a network television ad on the
theme starting today. The ad criticizes Republican George Bush's
proposal to put Quayle, his running mate, in charge of the nation's
war on drugs.
   The ad says cocaine traffic rose 300 percent, drugs in the
schools increased and ``Panamanian drug lord Noriega (was) kept on
the government payroll'' while Bush himself was in charge of the
Reagan administration effort to stem the flow of drugs into this
country.
   ``And now George Bush wants to put Dan Quayle in charge for the
next four years,'' the ad says, showing a debate clip of Quayle
saying he'll be coordinating the drug effort. ``If George Bush
couldn't handle the job, how do you think Dan Quayle is gonna do?''
the ad concludes.
   The Dukakis offensive came a day after Bush began airing an ad
telling viewers the Massachusetts governor has opposed ``virtually
every defense system we developed,'' a charge the Dukakis campaign
says is false.
   The Bush ad shows a helmeted Dukakis riding a tank, a campaign
appearance that was designed to counter his anti-military image but
ended up backfiring with voters.
   ``He opposed new aircraft carriers. He opposed anti-satellite
weapons. He opposed four missile systems, including the Pershing 2
missile deployment. Michael Dukakis opposed the Stealth bomber and
a ground emergency warning system against nuclear attack. He even
criticized our rescue mission to Grenada and our strike on Libya,''
the ad says. ``Now he wants to be our commander-in-chief. America
can't afford that risk.''
   Dukakis spokeswoman Lorraine Voles called the spot ``just more
distortions from the Bush campaign.'' She said Dukakis did not
oppose the actions in Libya and Grenada and supports the Stealth
bomber and the Trident 2 sea-based missile.
   He opposes two missile systems, the Midgetman and the mobile MX,
but has said he would ``work with Congress to find a sensible,
affordable way to maintain the effectiveness of the land-based leg
of the defense triad,'' Voles said.
   She said Dukakis also supports the development of a new advanced
tactical fighter and nuclear attack submarines.
   Since Friday the Dukakis campaign has been running two ads
nationwide _ both of them low-key, relatively positive spots
featuring Dukakis talking directly into the camera about family
concerns and America's international economic status.
   Bush has been running two network ads that tout his
international experience. One says he ``led the way'' on the recent
U.S.-Soviet arms reduction treaty, and the other says he would be
ready immediately after taking office to negotiate with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev while Dukakis would have to be trained
for the job.
   Both campaigns continued to run regional television advertising,
much of it focused on crime and environmental issues in key states
such as California and Texas. And Dukakis began a new series of
economic spots in Ohio, all three produced by Jerry Austin, who
managed Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign.
   The new spots, which may be used elsewhere in the Midwest, focus
on Dukakis' plan to help families buy their first homes, the loss
of U.S. jobs to foreign workers, and Bush's record as chairman of a
commission examining U.S.-Japanese trade relations.
   Both campaigns are planning television drives to woo Hispanic
voters, the Dukakis ads scheduled to start this week in
high-intensity Hispanic areas. Bush also plans a large TV drive
aimed at Hispanic voters closer to the Nov. 8 election.

   A teller was shot to death during a bank
robbery Tuesday by three men wearing masks and gloves, officials
said.
   The three men, armed with shotguns and pistols, entered the
Mercantile National Bank branch in this Chicago suburb shortly
after 10:30 a.m. The teller was shot in the head and a security
guard was disarmed, said Detective Sgt. Ray Myszak.
   The trio escaped with an undetermined amount of money, Myszak
said.
   The teller was identified as Evelyn Sostaric, 60, of Hammond,
the wife of an investigator for the Lake County prosecutor's office
who is also a retired police officer.
   Mrs. Sostaric was pronounced dead at St. Margaret hospital about
an hour after being shot, said hospital spokeswoman Rose Hand.
   Mercantile Bank Chairman Joseph Morrow offered a $20,000 reward
for information leading to the arrest of the gunman.
   ``This was done to her with no provocation whatsoever,'' Morrow
said of the shooting.
   A witness who had pulled into the bank's drive-up window told
police Mrs. Sostaric had tried to tell her the bank was being
robbed.

   A man who was one of the 52 U.S. hostages
held for 444 days in Iran reached a settlement Tuesday in his $60
million libel lawsuit against the Daily News' former publishers,
both sides said.
   The terms of the settlement with the Los Angeles newspaper were
not disclosed, but former hostage Jerry Plotkin said in a statement
that he was compensated for substantial damages.
   ``At last I am truly a free man,'' Plotkin said.
   Plotkin and the other hostages were freed in January 1981. A day
later, the Daily News said in a front-page story that police had
investigated Plotkin before he went to Iran, and that he was the
target of a federal drug trafficking probe.
   The story was attributed to unidentified law enforcement
sources. Police and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials
later denied such allegations had been made.
   At the time the story was published the Daily News was owned by
the Van Nuys Publishing Co., a subsidiary of the Chicago-based
Tribune Co.
   Van Nuys Publishing released a joint statement Tuesday in which
it did not admit to wrongdoing, and said, ``We believe that the
article was published ... with a good-faith belief in the truth of
the statements contained in it.
   ``The article was not intended to convey the impression that Van
Nuys Publishing Company had any information that Mr. Plotkin was in
Iran for any improper or illegal reasons,'' the statement said.
``All of the evidence which has been developed during the pendency
of Mr. Plotkin's lawsuit establishes that he went to Iran for
completely legitimate business purposes. Such evidence further
establishes that he was not the target of any law enforcement
investigation of any kind at the time he left for Iran or since.''
   The statement noted that Plotkin had dropped as defendants in
the case the reporters who wrote the story.
   ``We have settled the case with Mr. Plotkin in order to avoid
further lengthy and costly litigation and to bring this matter to a
close,'' it said. The Daily News now is owned by media and sports
entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke and its current management and owners
were not involved in the Plotkin lawsuit.

<HEAD>Shamir Boards City Bus In Defiance Of Arab Stone-Throwers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, flanked by a
crowd of cheering supporters, rode a city bus through Palestinian
neighborhoods where Israeli passengers often face stone-throwing
attacks.
   Supporters shouted ``Shamir, Shamir'' and clapped their hands
Tuesday as the No. 25 bus rolled through the Arab village of
Shuafat in Arab east Jerusalem on its way to the Jewish
neighborhood of Neve Yaakov.
   Hours later, police fired rubber bullets at Arab stone-throwers
near Shuafat, injuring one, a police spokesman said.
   Shamir, who leads the right-wing Likud bloc, made the symbolic
gesture shortly after declaring that the 10-month-old Palestinian
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip was a ``useless
struggle.''
   The future of the occupied territories is a key campaign issue
in the Nov. 1 national elections.
   Shamir opposes territorial concessions. His main rival, Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres of the left-leaning Labor Party, favors a
land-for-peace deal with Israel's Arab neighbors.
   ``Israel will never move under the pressure of (the uprising),''
Shamir told reporters in Jerusalem. ``All of this suffering, all of
these victims ... it doesn't bring any results. Therefore, it will
come to an end.''
   At least 301 Palestinians have died since violence broke out
Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, captured by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war. Six Israelis also have died.
   Peres, meanwhile, warned Tuesday that keeping the territories,
where 1.5 million Palestinians live, could lead to Israeli
annexation of the region and create an Arab majority in the Jewish
state.
   ``Some Israelis want to give up the people and not the land,''
Peres told members of the U.S.-based United Jewish Appeal. ``We
never would agree to become a nation of slaves and we should not be
tempted to become a nation of masters.''
   Peres said balloting should be held in the occupied lands so a
delegation can be elected to represent the Palestinians, alongside
Jordan, in peace talks with Israel.
   Shamir called Peres' peace plan unworkable and dismissed the
call for elections as a campaign gimmick that ``people will forget
about.''
   A poll published Tuesday in the daily Maariv newspaper showed
that 30 percent of the 1,200 Israelis questioned supported
annexation while 24 percent favored joint Israeli-Palestinian rule
over the territories without PLO participation.
   Israel refuses to deal with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which it views as a terrorist group.
   The radical Moledet (Homeland) movement, which advocates
expulsion of Palestinians from the occupied territories, broadcast
its first campaign ad Tuesday.
   The ad featured a stern-looking Rehovoam Zeevi, the party leader
and a retired army general, telling voters: ``Peace can be achieved
by separation of two peoples ... now it is time to transfer Arabs
(from the occupied lands.)'' Pictures of Arab rioters appeared in
the background.
   Zeevi's Moledet and the Likud are expected to benefit from
Tuesday's Supreme Court decision barring the anti-Arab Kach
movement led by U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane from participating in
the elections.
   The court, in a 5-0 ruling, said Kahane's anti-Arab party
``incites racism and negates the democratic character of the
state.''
   The court also ruled 3-2 that the Progressive List for Peace, a
leftist party that advocates an independent Palestinian state
alongside Israel, could take part in the elections.
   The Likud and other right-wing parties have demanded that the
PLP be disqualified on grounds it threatened to destroy the Jewish
character of the state.

``I was too tall and so uncomfortable around the more boisterous

   Former child star Shirley Temple

misappropriated her name for commercial purposes in sales of
``Shirley Temple Soda Pop.''
   The lawsuit against Shirley's Temple Inc., the soft drink maker,
and Walker International Specialty Foods, both of nearby Santa

   Black's attorney has since written to request that production of
the drink halt, but has been told that would result in financial
ruin for the company.
   Shirley's Temple Inc. attorney, Donal Lewin, said his client has
risked everything he owns to bring the drink to the market and
hasn't used Black's image to promote the product or implied she was

   Lewin also said similar soft drinks have been sold worldwide for
years. A hearing on the court action is set for Nov. 10.

   Soul singer James Brown has been ordered to
undergo treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, and prohibited from
driving while traffic charges against him are pending.
   Municipal Court Judge Carl C. Brown Jr. imposed those conditions
Tuesday as he granted a motion filed by the singer's lawyers
seeking a jury trial in Richmond County State Court. The
entertainer's case had been assigned to Municipal Court, which does
not have jury trials.
   Brown, on tour in Europe, did not attend the hearing.
   The singer was charged last month with driving under the
influence, driving with a suspended license and improper movement
on the roadway. The arrest was the latest in a string of run-ins
with the law Brown has had this year.
   A trial has not been scheduled.

<HEAD>When You're Out of Zhiguli, You're Out of Soviet Beer</HEAD>

   Glasnost could come to this: American
television ads proclaiming, ``Zhiguli, the czar of beers _ when
you're out of Zhiguli, you're out of beer.''
   It's pronounced zee-GUH-lee, as in the best-selling beer in the
Soviet Union.
   And if a new joint venture between the Soviet government and
American investors is successful, Zhiguli will be just one of a
number of Soviet products trying to make a dent in the giant
American market.
   The group also has high hopes for Laggidze Waters, a
fruit-flavored soft drink made from mineral waters from the
Georgian region of the Soviet Union.
   The new joint venture, called Torg International, the Russian
word for trade, was launched Tuesday with toasts of Soviet
champagne at the Soviet embassy.
   The participants credited Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
campaign of perestroika, the economic restructuring designed to
overhaul the stagnant Soviet economy, as the guiding force behind
the new effort.
   ``This is a joint venture with the aim of selling in the United
States some Soviet goods, Soviet soft drinks, Soviet beer, Soviet
candies, Soviet chocolates, perhaps some other goods of high
quality,'' said Soviet Ambassador Yuriy Dubinin. ``It is one more
step in the development of Soviet-American relations.''
   The new company, which is 51 percent owned by American investors
and 49 percent owned by the Soviet government, will have exclusive
marketing rights in the United States for a range of products
including beer, soft drinks, wine, brandies, vegetables, nuts,
fruits and other types of food.
   While American companies have often formed joint ventures in
order to do business in the Soviet Union, this will be the first
between a U.S. company and the Soviet government in this country.
Any profits will be split between the American investors and the
Soviet government.
   Plans call for Laggidze (lah-GEED-zee) Waters to begin appearing
on store shelves by next May, followed shortly thereafter by
Zhiguli beer.
   Officials in the new enterprise said they were undaunted by the
huge advertising budgets or market shares now held by American
soft-drink giants.
   ``These are not your traditional American soft drinks,'' said
George Carroll, who will serve as president of Torg International.
``These soft drinks are 100 percent natural products. There is no
caffeine, no additives of any kind. There is no sugar.''
   As an added selling feature, the mineral water comes from the
mountains of Georgia, the region of the Soviet Union famous for the
longevity of its residents, Carroll said.
   He said his company, the Cleveland Export Import Trade Co., was
prepared to spend $10 million initially in starting the new
enterprise.
   While the company that produces Laggidze Waters has been around
for 100 years, the Soviets' bottling process is so antiquated that
all of the labels are still put on by hand.
   Carroll said the American investors would be sending
label-pasting machines to the Soviet Union along with filtration
systems to increase the shelf-life of the soft drinks.
   Carroll said the Soviet products will be aimed at the same
upscale market that buys Stolichnaya, the Soviet vodka.
   ``We are not upgrading the quality of their goods. The quality
of their goods is excellent,'' Carroll said. ``What we are doing is
helping them with the logistics of marketing.''
   Carroll said the soft drinks will be introduced first, followed
by the Zhiguli beer and then wine and Soviet champagne.
   Since Gorbachev met with U.S. businessmen on his trip to the
United States last year, the Soviets have stepped up their efforts
to interest Western businesses in doing business with the Soviet
government.
   Vadin Ignatov, vice chairman of the Soviet agricultural
ministry, said Tuesday that another of his country's goals is to
use the technical expertise learned in the new joint venture to
increase the quantity and quality of consumer goods available to
Soviet consumers.
   ``We think this joint venture will be in the interest of both
the American and Soviet people,'' he said. ``I think this is very
significant that the first major trade we are going to be doing is
something as peaceful as soft drinks.''

   Donations to charity decrease as incomes
increase, according to a Gallup poll which says low- and
moderate-income Americans are more generous than their upper-income
counterparts.
   ``Giving and volunteering in America is a stark contrast between
heart-warming generosity and bone-chilling selfishness,'' said
Brian O'Connell, president of the Independent Sector, a nonprofit
coalition of 650 corporate, foundation and volunteer organizations
which commissioned the survey.
   The March survey of 2,775 adults 18 years and over produced
profiles of the most and least generous Americans according to
income, family status, church membership, community size and region.
   Those most likely to make contributions and volunteer their time
were members of low- to moderate-income families, churchgoers,
rural residents and Midwesterners.
   The least generous were the affluent, single individuals, the
non-churchgoing, city dwellers and Southerners.
   ``Contrary to popular opinion, the well-to-do in America cannot
be described as generous,'' O'Connell said.
   O'Connell said at a press conference Tuesday that contributing
households with incomes below $10,000 gave an average of 2.8
percent of their income to charity. Those with incomes from $10,000
to $29,999 gave 2.5 percent, while those between $30,000 and
$49,999 gave 2 percent.
   Contributing households with incomes between $50,000 to $74,999
gave 1.5 percent; those earning $75,000 to $99,999 donated 1.7
percent, and those with incomes of $100,000 or more gave 2.1
percent.
   Overall, the survey found that 70 percent of the households in
America make charitable contributions.
   The average amount of annual contributions per household was
$790.
   Members of almost half of the households _ 45 percent _ also
volunteered time to charitable activities. The average per
household was 4.7 hours a week in 1987.
   Extrapolated to the entire U.S. population, the figures would
translate into 80 million people giving a total of 19.5 billion
hours worth $150 billion in time contributed, O'Connell said.
   The study indicated a link between religion and charitable
support, with 79 percent of church members contributing money and
51 percent volunteering time. Among non-members, 55 percent made
donations and 33 percent volunteered time.
   However, more than one in five of the church members _ 22
percent _ contributed only to religion and not to any other
charities.
   Eugene C. Dorsey, head of the group's ``Give Five'' campaign to
increase volunteerism, said the study shows it is possible to reach
the organization's goal of motivating Americans to donate at least
5 percent of their incomes and five hours a week apiece to the
causes of their choice.
   But Dorsey, who also serves as president of the Gannett
Foundation, said the findings also confirm the need for
establishment of ``a basic standard of what we owe to our
communities.''
   Virginia A. Hodgkinson, the coalition's vice president for
research, said its previous surveys had missed the link between
rising income and decreasing support for charity. She said the
earlier studies measured only the amount given without regard to
what percentage of income the donated amount represented.
   She said the profiles of the most and least generous Americans
were based on the averages for weekly volunteerism, contributions
as percentage of income and the percentages of family members who
were volunteers.
   Using this formula, the Midwest was first with individual
volunteers donating 2.5 hours of their time and 1.5 percent of
their income, followed by the West (2.4 hours, 1.5 percent of
income), the East (2.0 hours, 1.2 percent) and the South (1.8
hours, 1.7 percent).
   Although those questioned in the South reported giving a greater
percentage of earnings to charity, Hodgkinson said this group had a
lower overall proportion of households with volunteers and fewer
volunteers overall in the general population.
   Rankings by size of community, using the same criteria, were:
rural (2.4 hours, 1.8 percent of income), suburban (2.2 hours, 1.5
percent), and city (2.0 hours, 1.3 percent).
   Married people gave an average of 2.5 hours a week and donated
1.5 percent of their income, compared with singles who gave 2 hours
a week and just 0.5 percent of their income.
   Those with three or more children gave 2.7 hours a week and
donated 2 percent of their income, compared with 2.5 hours and 1.4
per cent of income for those with fewer children.

<HEAD>Appeals Judges Suggest Support for Air Control Drug Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of federal appellate judges is
suggesting that random testing for drug use by air traffic
controllers and guards at chemical-weapons depots might be
justified by concerns about safety.
   An attorney for two employees' unions was confronted with sharp
questioning about the safety issue at a hearing Tuesday about drug
testing of nearly 30,000 Transportation Department and 9,400
civilian Army employees.
   ``Doesn't the government have a legitimate employer concern in
finding out whether the guard watching that nerve gas is on
hard-line drugs?'' Circuit Judge Abner Mikva asked union attorney
Joe Goldberg during the hearing.
   ``We all placidly and docilely go through the airport metal
detectors,'' said Patricia Wald, chief judge of the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here. ``Why not put the guy minding the nerve gas
on the same side as airport detection'' of potential hijackers, she
asked.
   Goldberg argued that the test the government was using was an
unconstitutional invasion of privacy because it could not determine
whether an employee was impaired by drug use while on the job.
   All the urine test can do is determine that an employee had used
illegal drugs in the past five days, he said.
   ``Before the government can cast its net over assumedly
non-using employees, there must be some reason for the invasion
into the private lives of employees that has some relationship to
work-related conduct,'' Goldberg said.
   He urged the appeals court to apply the standard it adopted last
year when it said testing of District of Columbia school employees
was justified as part of physicals if the test could predict
on-the-job impairment.
   But during repeated questioning by Wald, Mikva and Circuit Judge
David Sentelle, Goldberg conceded that a positive test for an
employee in a sensitive job might raise proper concerns over
whether the person could do the job safely.
   ``In certain positions, a positive drug test could very well
have an employment nexus,'' Goldberg said.
   ``Why is not that the end of the argument?'' Wald said.
   Goldberg said that still didn't resolve the issue of whether the
government could ``justify a warrantless random search'' without
suspicions of drug use by particular people.
   ``The question is: Is the test justified in its inception and is
it narrowly related in scope?'' he said.
   Assistant Attorney General John Bolton argued that the
government had ``taken the step of limiting drug testing to a very
narrowly defined category of individuals'' including guards at
nerve-gas arsenals and a base where directed-energy laser weapons
are being tested.
   The Transportation Department testing, which was upheld last
year by a lower court judge, covers air traffic controllers,
drivers, airplane inspectors, sky marshals and other ``sensitive
and critical'' positions.
   The Army program was declared unconstitutional earlier this year
by another federal judge in the case brought by the American
Federation of Government Employees and the National Federation of
Federal Employees.
   A ruling on both cases might be held up until the court receives
word next spring from the Supreme Court on two other cases
involving drug testing.
   The high court is set to hear arguments Nov. 2 on testing of
railroad crews after accidents and U.S. Customs Service agents
seeking promotions.
   Mikva voiced concern that employees with prostate problems might
lose their jobs if they couldn't provide a urine sample within a
two-hour period mandated by the regulations.
   Bolton replied that two hours was a ``reasonable time period.''
   ``I won't put you to the test, Mr. Bolton,'' Mikva said.

<HEAD>Soviet Military Shipments to Nicaragua Decrease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has cut back on the amount of
arms it is providing to Nicaragua but Reagan administration
officials say they doubt Soviet support for the Sandinista regime
has diminished.
   The arms shipments ``are down in dollar value and tonnage,'' Dan
Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said Tuesday.
   ``Apparently, it's a move from the supplying of heavy equipment
_ everything from bulldozers to tanks to artillery _ to providing
them more sustainability, like ammunition supplies. You can draw
your own conclusions about what that is about.
   ``But we don't necessarily conclude that this means the Soviets
are backing off from their support for Nicaragua. Certainly, the
war-fighting capability (of Nicaragua) has not gone down.''
   During the first nine months of the year, the Soviets and their
Warsaw Pact allies shipped 13,000 metric tons _ or about 14,300
regular tons _ of military equipment to Nicaragua, according to the
latest Defense Department estimate.
   By comparison, shipments of Soviet equipment during calendar
1987 arrived at an average rate of 1,808 metric tons per month _ or
16,272 metric tons for the first nine months of 1987. That
translates to 17,899 regular tons.
   The drop in tonnage in 1988 also is reflected by intelligence
estimates of the dollar value of the arms received.
   The Pentagon estimated the materiel delivered during the first
nine months of this year was worth $350 million. Shipments in 1987
were worth about $42 million a month _ or about $378 million for
nine months.
   During all of 1987, the Nicaraguans received 21,700 metric tons
of arms valued at $505 million, the Defense Department estimates.
   Despite evidence of an arms slowdown, Howard said Nicaragua was
still maintaining the largest military force in the region and that
thanks to previous arms deliveries, ``they're extraordinarily well
armed ... (and) constitute a threat to their neighbors.''
   The slowdown in deliveries to the Sandinistas comes at a time
when American military aid to the Contra guerrillas has been cut
off completely for eight months. The Reagan administration, under
congressional pressure, ended its military assistance to the rebels
at the end of February, three weeks before a truce and cease-fire
took effect.
   The truce has failed to produce a permanent peace, and
skirmishes are still being reported between Sandinista forces and
the rebels. Absent a major Sandinista offensive, however, President
Reagan announced last week he would not attempt to win
congressional approval for more lethal aid.
   Until this year, Soviet arms shipments to the Sandinistas have
climbed steadily, rising from only about 1.6 metric tons in 1980 to
a record 22,000 metric tons in 1986 and last year's near-record
21,700 metric tons.

   The commander of U.S. military forces in
the Middle East says he believes American journalists ``tell the
story better than we do'' and should be given as much access to
military operations as possible.
   Gen. George B. Crist, commander of U.S. Central Command, said
officials should not try to interfere with reporting of adverse
developments or incidents that reflect unfavorably on the military.
   ``There's always the chance of terrible things, but we're going
to tell them anyway if it goes wrong, right? If we had a disaster
out there, we're going to have to say it anyway, so we might as
well have the press out there to see what the hell happened and
explain it,'' he said.
   Crist, a four-star Marine Corps general, retires next month
after three years in charge of U.S. military affairs in the Middle
East. He made his remarks in an interview during a farewell tour of
the Persian Gulf.
   The Navy's gulf operation during the past 17 months is its
largest undertaking since Vietnam, costing $15 million to $20
million a month, according to Pentagon estimates.
   ``In terms of shooting at ships and other things we've done it's
the biggest since World War II,'' said Capt. Donald Dvornik, a
senior aide to Crist.
   Crist himself noted that some historians described a one-day
series of clashes with Iran on April 18 as the biggest U.S. naval
engagement since the battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944.
   The United States now has 26 warships in the region, including
10 in the gulf, but plans cutbacks if the Aug. 20 cease-fire
continues to hold. The truce ended eight years of hostilities
between Iraq and Iran.
   Crist indicated that his views on news media coverage of
military operations were strongly shaped by the 1983 invasion of
Grenada, in which the Pentagon barred the media from accompanying
U.S. forces.
   That decision was seen as contributing to highly negative news
coverage of the mission, which the Reagan administration said was
to prevent a Cuban-backed communist takeover of the Caribbean
island.
   The Grenada dispute led the Pentagon to set up standing
``pools'' of print and broadcast reporters to cover U.S. military
operations. The system, itself controversial, saw its first test
under combat conditions in the gulf.
   During the year ending last July, rotating groups of journalists
were allowed to report from aboard Navy warships. Their material
was not censored, but was subject to ``security review'' to screen
out militarily sensitive information.
   Crist, who is described by subordinates as a security-conscious
taskmaster, witnessed the Grenada invasion as a Pentagon staff
officer working for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``If we had brought the correspondents in the second day, after
the heavy fighting was over, and let them see what I saw, it would
have been different coverage,'' he said.
   ``And I was convinced when we came out here, that I wasn't going
to do that ... The American press gives better coverage, they tell
the story better than we do.''
   He said he had seen instances where ``the news was coming as
fast as we knew what was going on. We and you and the American
public were all getting it about the same time, and they all
learned that great lesson _ never believe the first report.''

   Laser-protected homes, pocket telephones and
interactive television will be commonplace in the United States of
the future, but the nation could face a potentially devastating
AIDS epidemic and a growing threat from high-tech terrorists,
researchers say.
   In its annual summary of predictions, the World Future Society
says AIDS could have the impact of a world war by the end of the
century.
   The predictions for 1989 and beyond summarize, but do not
detail, reports published during the past year by the society, a
non-profit educational group based in Bethesda, Md., which
encourages study of issues affecting the future.
   On the positive side, the society foresees technological
advances in the home, improved quality of life in America's cities,
and better working conditions as corporations give more attention
to job satisfaction.
   Workers over age 50 will find a growing demand for their
stability and experience, the report said.
   Company policies in support of families will become much more
common as the Baby Boom generation moves into the upper echelon of
management. These will include on-site child care, flexible working
hours and sick leave for children's illnesses.
   Among the society's other projections:
   _City downtowns will become more livable. Many will plant trees
and establish cultural and entertainment facilities such as arts
districts, children's museums and aquariums. Shopping areas will
increasingly be combined with educational, cultural and
entertainment facilities.
   _Many homes will be protected by laser shields and artificial
intelligence security systems, with surveillance by heat-sensitive
monitors and even satellites becoming possible.
   _Pocket-sized telephones will become available, someday
replacing public phones.
   _Interactive television will play a large role in the classroom
of the future, giving students in remote locations the ability to
see, hear and talk to a professor hundreds of miles away.
   _Businesses will need to provide continuous employee training as
the automation and computer revolutions eliminate many low-literacy
jobs.
   _Computers will become a popular target for terrorists. Attacks
on high-tech targets, such as computer networks, telecommunications
facilities and defense computers could pose a major threat.
   _Fraud may become the crime of choice in the future as America
grows older, replacing burglary which requires the speed and
agility of youth.
   _New discoveries in biotechnology and genetic engineering could
lead to the replacement of nerve cells, arteries, hormone-producing
cells and even brain cells. Artificial implants will become more
common.
   _Coastal structures ranging from cottages to airports built on
reclaimed land will face a threat from rising sea levels as the
greenhouse effect melts the polar ice caps.
   _Major disease problems of the next century will include
immune-system disorders, viral conditions, bacteria that have
become resistant to today's antibiotics, allergies to new chemicals
and mental health problems such as alcoholism, drug dependence and
mood disorders.
   The society says total deaths from AIDS _ acquired immune
deficiency syndrome _ could top 50 million worldwide in the 1990s,
more than the Black Death of the Middle Ages. The World Health
Organization recently estimated that as many as 10 million people
worldwide now have AIDS and that another 1 million victims could be
recorded by 1993.
   But the society says the crisis brought by AIDS could spur a
boom in medical research that might avoid a plague while also
benefiting people suffering from other diseases. Another positive
side effect could be establishment of national health insurance
systems, the futurists say.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact
with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons.
   As of Oct. 10, AIDS had been diagnosed in 75,437 Americans, of
whom 42,432 had died, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   The society's summary of predictions is being published in the
November-December issue of its Futurist magazine.

   A technician who plugged an
electrical cable into the wrong slot is being blamed by NASA for a
flash electrical fire that damaged the $216 million Magellan probe
being readied for a mission to Venus.
   The space agency reported Tuesday the damage was not serious and
would take five to seven days to repair. Officials said there would
be no impact on Magellan's launch aboard the space shuttle
Atlantis, scheduled for April.
   Smoke and a 2-to-3-inch flame spurted from a spacecraft battery
when a worker tried to insert a cable connector into the wrong
receptacle Monday night, Vince Wirth, a project spokesman, told a
news conference Tuesday.
   ``Technicians on the scene quickly put out the fire within a
minute with a halon fire extinguisher,'' Wirth said. ``But by then
the damage was done. It resulted in a short that damaged the
battery and wire harness and insulation blankets near the battery.''
   Wirth played a videotape that showed some soot damage around the
battery area. The battery, he explained, was being used to run
routine power system checks in the spacecraft's forward equipment
module and is not part of the flight equipment.
   He said Magellan, because of its planetary mission, must be
contamination-free and that the soot would have to be carefully
removed by cleaning experts flown here from NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and from Martin Marietta in Denver,
where the craft was built.
   Because an electrical short was involved, engineers were
checking to make certain there was no damage to other electrical
components such as the spacecraft signal processor, Wirth said.
   ``Apparently the wrong plug was put in the power supply, James
C. Fletcher, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
administrator, told reporters in Washington. ``I don't know whether
you ever tried to put a multipronged plug into a socket, but it's
hard to do. It wouldn't fit, so he pushed it a little bit and it
shorted out the battery.
   ``We shouldn't allow this kind of stuff,'' Fletcher added.
``It's a human error. ... We'll have an investigation and take some
steps so it won't happen in the future.''
   Wirth said the technician who made the mistake worked for Martin
Marietta, which delivered Magellan here Oct. 8. The spacecraft is
being assembled and checked in a processing building and when
complete it will stand 21 feet and weigh 7,800 pounds.
   Wirth said because of the recent delivery, many electrical
components still had not been installed, reducing the possibility
of damage, and several protective shipping covers were still in
place, cutting down on the spread of soot.
   Atlantis' astronauts are to release Magellan from the shuttle
cargo bay, starting it on 446-day voyage to Venus. The craft is to
orbit the planet and map its surface with a radar camera.

<TEXT>
   Gambling helped build the reputation of
this Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down during
a poker game 112 years ago. Now city officials hope a return to
gambling will help preserve it.
   Voters statewide will be asked Nov. 8 to approve a
constitutional amendment allowing the Legislature to permit limited
gambling in Deadwood with the proceeds dedicated to preservation of
historic buildings. Deadwood voters also would have to approve the
final plan by 60 percent.
   ``We've always said Deadwood has the potential to be the Aspen
of the Midwest,'' said Bill Walsh, an owner of the Franklin Hotel,
at one end of the colorful Main Street. He said he wants to see
gambling limited to a few card tables and slot machines in existing
establishments.
   Walsh said gambling will draw more visitors year-around,
creating more jobs in service industries and pumping dollars into
the economy of the entire Black Hills.
   But others oppose gambling on moral grounds and say the
Constitution shouldn't be changed for the sake of one town.
   ``I'm opposed to any kind of gambling,'' said the Rev. Dick
Ward, a United Methodist minister in Rapid City who is mobilizing
opposition statewide. ``It preys on people that are weak. It gives
them the idea that they are going to get rich quick.''
   South Dakota's 99-year-old Constitution forbids games of chance,
but allows the Legislature to approve gambling for charitable,
religious, educational or public spirited purposes. In 1986, voters
amended the document to allow a state-run lottery, which began last
year.
   Other attempts to approve gambling have failed, including one
that would have allowed all communities to make local decisions on
games of chance.
   But city officials claim widespread support for gambling. They
say people are committed to historic preservation, and the money
has to come from somewhere.
   Mayor Tom Blair said it will take about $20 million to save more
than 100 buildings. He said his town of 1,800 people is overwhelmed
by the task of restoring and preserving the buildings Deadwood
built a century ago when 10,000 people lived in this boisterous
mining community.
   ``We have had a real unique stewardship handed to us by the
National Park Service,'' Blair said, adding that Deadwood is the
only entire city in South Dakota to be registered as a National
Landmark.
   Age, neglect and fire threaten to destroy that legacy unless
expensive restoration begins right away, the mayor said.
   The city got a painful reminder of that last December when fire
destroyed two historic buildings in the heart of the commercial
district, stopping at the wall of Saloon No. 10 where Hickok, the
frontier marshal, was shot to death Aug. 2, 1876, while playing
poker.
   ``I think it's true that a lot of people had their eyes opened
up on this after this fire,'' said Herb Haist, city planner.
   Most of the city's buildings were erected in the 20 years
between 1880 and 1900, Blair said. Earlier buildings were lost in
previous fires.
   Stately brick buildings, now turned into tourist shops, line
both sides of historic Main Street. Grand houses perch recklessly
on the steep sides of Deadwood Gulch, forming a city seven blocks
wide and three miles long.
   People across South Dakota should vote for the amendment the
future in mind, Walsh said. ``So South Dakotans can say, `Hey, we
saved Deadwood. We saved a part of our past.'''

<HEAD>Opposition Party Calls for End to Policy of Isolation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The major opposition party has issued a
platform calling for an end to Burma's policy of isolation and the
replacement of the socialist economy with a free enterprise system.
   A nine-page policy statement issued Tuesday by the the National
League for Democracy said it would seek closer relations with
foreign countries along with foreign investments and would
participate in international and regional economic organizations.
   But few observers gave the National League a chance of winning
elections even if they are held.
   After weeks of violent political protests, the military-backed
government reasserted control on Sept. 18 but allowed the formation
of opposition political parties and promised general elections, but
set no date.
   So far 22 parties have registered including the ruling National
Unity Party that has wielded power for the past 26 years.
   The ruling party and military have been in control since the
coup in 1962 led by Ne Win, who stepped down in July. Ne Win's
government adopted isolationatism and socialism and waged war
against a dozen insurgent groups seeking greater autonomy from the
central government.
   The National League for Democracy is headed by ex-Defense
Minister Tin Oo, former military officer Aung Gyi and Aung San Suu
Kyi, the daughter of the legendary freedom fighter Aung San.
   In its policy statment, the league said nationalized firms would
be returned to their original owners and all but a few state
enterprises vital to the nation would be privatized.
   It said the first priority would be ending the insurgencies by
various ethnic groups that are ``draining the country's resources
and hampering development.''
   ``Foreign investments will be permitted and a favorable
investment climate will be created by introducing measures such as
non-nationalization guarantees and favorable tax and labor laws in
accordance with international practice,'' the statement said.
   It also said ownership of land would be restored to the farmers
who would be allowed to grow and market their produce freely.
``Peasant and workers unions, independent of party politics, will
be encouraged as class organizations to protect their legitimate
righjts,'' the statement said.
   Radio Rangoon announced Tuesday that a curfew, in effect since
Sept. 18, has been shortened by one hour and will now be enforced
from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. But it did not say if the order affected
Rangoon only or the entire country.
   The government has said more than 450 persons have been killed
in the crackdown ordered last month to restore order.
   Independent estimates put the death toll much higher.

<HEAD>Civilian, Military Leaders At Odds Over Staff Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon military leaders are resisting
suggested cuts of up to 3,500 jobs that civilian defense officials
claim can be eliminated without harming security.
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff is arguing that no more than 500
positions should be cut from U.S. military commands worldwide,
while civilian manpower authorities believe the figure should be
between 3,000 and 3,500, officials said Tuesday.
   The two sides are ``not even close'' to agreement on a figure,
said one official, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
``The military guys are already starting to cry that they can't do
more with less.''
   Sources said the dispute is scheduled to be resolved by Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in time to be reflected in the fiscal
1990 budget when it is submitted to Congress in January.
   ``You can be sure that Carlucci is going to force more than 500
cuts out of the military, but it's hard to predict how many more,''
said one source.
   ``And since it's a lame-duck budget submission, his decision may
or may not hold,'' added another official. ``He is serious about
this, though.''
   The current fight dates to an internal study ordered by Carlucci
last December, shortly after he assumed the post of defense
secretary.
   The study was performed by a 22-member panel chaired by Derek J.
Vander Schaaf, the Pentagon's deputy inspector general. In
unusually blunt terms, it concluded in February the Pentagon could
eliminate 7,309 jobs from headquarters around the world _ or 12
percent of the total _ without jeopardizing readiness.
   Such cuts would save more than $300 million a year in operating
costs and eliminate duplication that in some cases almost
guarantees America's military forces will have a hard time fighting
any war, the study asserted.
   The panel found the Unified and Specified Commands around the
world were supported by 59,510 civilian and military staff, adding:
``The review disclosed significant areas of overlapping
responsibilities, duplication of functions, layering and
opportunities for saving manpower.''
   The panel's conclusion that 7,309 jobs were superfluous was sent
for review by the Pentagon's office for force management and
personnel and then by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the six-member
body that includes the nation's highest-ranking admirals and
generals.
   One source said the Pentagon's civilian manpower officials do
not agree with the 7,309 figure but ``certainly found plenty of
room for cutting,'' adding that they recommended cuts of up to
3,500 jobs.
   ``That's not even half of what Vander Schaaf recommended, but
the (Joints Chiefs) still says it's totally unacceptable,'' the
source said.
   The study panel criticized by name several commands as
overstaffed or unnecessary, including the U.S. Forces Caribbean
Command in Key West, Fla.; the Army's Western Command in Hawaii;
the Strategic Air Command, and the separate air and ground defense
command structures for Alaska.
   The panel also suggested 286 positions could be slashed from the
staff of the Joint Chiefs itself, which now numbers 2,005.

<HEAD>Massive Swarm of Bees Under Control; New Worry Is Mite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the 250,000 honeybees that broke
free from an overturned tractor-trailer in rush hour traffic have
been killed or caught, but state officials are still a mite worried
_ or worried, that is, about a mite.
   The state Department of Agriculture on Tuesday quaranteed four
metropolitan Atlanta counties to ensure that the parasite found on
some of the bees doesn't contaminate local hives.
   Samples analyzed from the bees showed traces of the Varroa
jacobsoni mite, which attacks adult and young bees, said
Agriculture Department spokesman Carlton Moor. It can cause bee
mutations and spreads quickly through the hive but poses no threat
to humans.
   The quarantine means no bees can be moved in or out of Cobb,
Fulton, Cherokee and DeKalb counties until the department verifies
the area is free from the Varroa mite.
   The bees were released from 200 hives that shattered when the
18-wheel flat-bed tractor-trailer hauling them from Wisconsin to
Florida flipped over Monday afternoon at the intersection of
Interstates 75 and 285 north of Atlanta.
   Witnesses said the collective hum of the insects was loud enough
to be heard above the sound of car radios as they swarmed through a
busy intersection. No one, however, reported being stung.
   State workers, aided by private beekeepers, used a garden-grade
insecticide to kill ``a whopping pile of them'' Monday night, said
Department of Transportation worker William Haithcock.
   Moore said the department was concerned that some of the
beekeepers that showed up to round up the escaped bees Monday
carried them back to their own hives.
   The bees were being shipped by West Virginia-based JimCo from
Dodgeville, Wis., to De Land, Fla., said JimCo dispatcher John
Holbrook in De Land.

<TEXT>
   Don't look now, but the drought is still with
us.
   Sure, the photos of stranded barges and withered corn have
disappeared from the front pages of newspapers and the evening news
shows.
   And it has rained a bit most places, quite a bit in some.
   But that doesn't mean all is well.
   ``The long-term drought is still there,'' said David Miskus,
editor of Weekly Climate Bulletin produced by the Climate Analysis
Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   The dryness isn't as bad today as it was _ a situation
illustrated by the fact that the special weekly drought advisory
issued by the Climate Analysis Center was discontinued Sept. 29,
with the conclusion that the summer had been the driest since 1936.
   But that final report added that chances were ``not favorable''
for ending the drought in the most severely affected Midwestern
states by Nov. 30.
   Miskus calculates that the Midwestern drought is now 31 weeks
old.
   ``The problem is that the northern Great Plains and northern
Rockies are entering into their normally dry period ... things
don't look too good unless something unusual happens,'' he said.
   The northern plains states don't normally get a lot of rain at
this time of year, and after the dry summer they are so far behind
that, without abnormally heavy rains, it will take a long time to
recover, said Thomas Headinghouse, editor of the Weekly Weather and
Crop Bulletin of the Department of Agriculture.
   ``Areas of the corn belt are also extremely dry. They did get
some good rains in the eastern corn belt (Monday), but on a
long-term basis it's still severely dry,'' said Headinghouse.
   A series of cold fronts produced showers and thunderstorms over
parts of the central Great Plains and Upper Midwest in September,
the Climate Analysis Center reports.
   But unusually dry conditions continued over large portions of
the corn belt with many stations having received less than 60
percent of normal rainfall since April 1, the center said.
   Planting the Midwest winter wheat crop is off to a good start,
according to Headinghouse, but that grain depends on winter
snowfall for moisture so farmers must wait and see what will
develop in coming months.
   Some rain and snow fell on fire ravaged areas of Yellowstone
National Park in September, yet precipitation in most of Idaho and
Wyoming was still less than 50 percent of normal for the month.
   Along the West Coast conditions have improved somewhat, but this
should be the start of the rainy season there and rainfall hasn't
begun to pick up significantly, he noted.
   The main area of recovery is the Southeast, Headinghouse said,
with conditions especially wet along the Gulf Coast, although
rainfall continues to be lacking in the mountains of western North
Carolina.
   But parts of the Southeast have been suffering from unusual
dryness for four or five years, Miskus added. Even though there has
been considerable rain in the region in recent weeks, many sections
have experienced a shortage of 40 to 60 inches over the last few
years.
   ``I don't know how you ever make up for that,'' Miskus said.
   Low water is no longer stranding barges at Memphis, but the
Mississippi River remains below normal, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey.
   Indeed, with a daily flow of 102 billion gallons per day at
Vicksburg, Miss., the river was some 44 percent below normal for
the month of September, the agency said.
   The Columbia River is also running low, 40 percent below normal
at The Dalles, Ore., the survey reported. It averaged 37.5 billion
gallons per day.
   Of the nation's three largest rivers only the St. Lawrence was
near normal last month, just 6 percent low at Massena, N.Y. It
averaged 157 billion gallons a day, topping the Mississippi which
usually carries the largest volume of water.
   New England and the Northeast, which had been spared the worst
of the summer drought, experienced drier than normal conditions in
September.

<HEAD>Administration Dilutes Opposition To Khmer Rouge in Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sponsors of a congressional resolution on
Cambodia are dismayed by administration reluctance to take a
stronger stand against Chinese support for the Marxist rebel group
accused of the mass murder of Cambodian civilians a decade ago.
   On Tuesday, President Reagan signed the resolution, the main
features of which call for an end to Vietnam's military presence in
Cambodia and efforts to ensure the Khmer Rouge, which ruled
Cambodia for 3{ bloody years in the late 1970's, do not return to
power.
   The administration has said repeatedly there must be ``effective
safeguards'' to ensure that the Khmer Rouge, now a powerful
guerrilla force, do not achieve a dominant role again in Cambodia.
   Nonetheless, the State Department fought hard during
negotiations with the Congress to protect the interests of the
Khmer Rouge's chief supplier, China, and the rebels' other regional
ally, Thailand.
   A key clause in the original resolution asserted that the United
States ``should attempt immediately'' to halt the flow of arms and
military equipment to the Khmer Rouge. At administration
insistence, the word ``immediately'' was deleted. There were other
changes which had the effect of watering down the resolution.
   Both China and Thailand have as their highest priority the
withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and believe that
the Khmer Rouge is in the best position to hasten that process.
   China is worried about being encircled by pro-Soviet regimes and
believes that public commitments by Vietnam to withdraw from
Cambodia by 1990 are the direct result of Khmer Rouge military
pressure, according to administration officials.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest of the three rebel groups
fighting the pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia. The other two, both
non-communist, are supported by the United States.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., a Senate sponsor of the resolution,
has said that the ``self-imposed silence of the American
government'' enabled China to nurse ``the Khmer Rouge beast'' back
to health.
   The chief House sponsors, Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on East Asian affairs, and
Chester Atkins, D-Mass., were out of town and unavailable for
comment Tuesday.
   But aides said both were disheartened by the administration's
deferential attitude toward China and Thailand at the expense of a
stronger stand against a group which is accused of killing between
1 million and 2 million Cambodians during their rule.
   Solarz and Atkins acquiesced in the change, fearing that a
protracted fight over wording could have led to an impasse, the
aides said. This could have meant congressional adjournment this
week with no Cambodia resolution at all.
   A State Department official, insisting on anonymity, said China
is adamant on continuing its support for the Khmer Rouge and no
amount of congressional pressure could alter the Chinese position.
On that basis, the administration fought the original wording of
the resolution.
   The official said China has come part way toward the
administration view of the Cambodian situation. He noted that China
indicated this past summer for the first time that the Khmer Rouge
should not have a dominant role in the formation of a new
government in Cambodia once Vietnam withdraws its troops.

   The mood in Congress is still strongly against
renewing military aid to Nicaragua's rebel movement, but the Senate
says that could change if the leftist government fails to comply
with peace accords calling for more democracy.
   The Senate on Tuesday approved a non-binding ``sense of the
Senate'' resolution declaring its support for unspecified
``continuing efforts to strengthen the internal democratic
opposition and the independent media of Nicaragua.''
   It also called for ``maintaining the Nicaraguan freedom fighters
as one of the few `pressure points' on the Sandinistas by providing
the resistance urgently needed humanitarian assistance.''
   The dwindling Contra forces are subsisting on $27 million in
food, clothing and medical supplies approved by Congress last month
as part of a Pentagon money bill.
   They haven't received any weapons from the United States since
February, when lethal aid was suspended. But Congress has agreed to
permit President Reagan to request the release of $16.5 million in
weapons, if certain conditions are met.
   Reagan said last week he might call the Congress into special
session to release the aid should the Sandinista forces strike hard
against the Contra guerrillas before the 101st Congress convenes
next January.
   ``It's important for the Senate to send a message, not only to
the resistance in Nicaragua, but to people throughout the world,''
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
   McCain was the chief author of the non-binding ``sense of the
Senate'' resolution. It was approved on a voice vote after an
earlier attempt to kill it was defeated, 54-12.
   The resolution was attached to an unrelated bill affecting more
than 6 million acres of federal wilderness lands in Montana.
   Also attached to the bill before it was passed on a voice vote
were resolutions endorsing Chile's movement toward restoration of
democracy and urging U.S. allies to block Soviet efforts to win the
approval of loans worth millions of U.S. dollars.
   The legislation faces an uncertain future as Congress heads
toward adjournment. The House has yet to approve it, and any
changes from the Senate-passed legislation would have to be cleared
by a House-Senate conference committee.
   The Chilean proposal, sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, was
added to the Contra measure on a voice vote.
   Chileans voted Oct. 5 to reject a new presidetial term for Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, the military leader who has ruled the nation
since a 1973 coup overthrew the socialist civilian president,
Salvador Allende.
   ``We've had a long night of despair in Chile, from the coup in
1973 to until this year,'' said Harkin. ``It's incumbent on us to
support the Chilean people, to support this election they had, to
say that we are going to work with them in this restoration of full
democracy.''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., termed the proposal ``a feel-good
amendment'' and said Pinochet had saved Chile from going communist.
   The Soviet loan amendment, approved 64-2, was proposed by Sen.
Steven Symms, R-Idaho.
   He said the Soviets are trying to secure loans of U.S. dollars
through third nations. ``The Soviets are using the eagerness of the
Western allies to play one nation off against another, to get them
to compete with each other for the opportunity to donate hard
currency to finance socialist economic failures and Soviet foreign
policy.''
   The wilderness bill affects more than 6 million acres of Montana
and is the result of a compromise worked out among competing
interests, including conservationists and the timber and lumber
industries.
   The bill designates about 1.43 million acres of Forest Service
land as wilderness, 360,000 acres as special management areas, and
another 20,000 acres as federal study areas. It also releases for
non-wildnerness uses more than 10 million acres in Montana's 10
national forests.

<HEAD>World French-Fry Fad Means Sizzling Spud Sales</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The homely potato has turned glamorous as a
U.S. export item and is finding new ways of seducing American
consumers, says an Agriculture Department report.
   ``Powered by the popularity abroad of fast-food chains featuring
french fries, American potato exports are sizzling,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said. ``At home, frozen use
has never been higher, and the microwave oven has given the fresh
potato a new lease on life.''
   By next summer, the agency said, french fries will be available
from vending machines in some cities. Ore-Ida Foods Inc., which
plans to begin the operation, says the machines will dispense 200
servings of hot, crispy fries in 3{-ounce portions at about 75
cents per serving.
   ``Potatoes pull in nearly $1 of every $5 received by American
vegetable producers,'' said USDA economist Gary Lucier.
   In the last five years, potato farmers grossed between $1.4
billion and $1.9 billion annually. Exports of fresh potatoes have
been relatively stable in recent years, with Canada receiving
nearly all the shipments. Sales of frozen products, however, have
soared to 112,000 metric tons last year from 64,000 tons in 1984,
with Japan the biggest market.
   Lucier and other economists say in the October issue of Farmline
magazine that the potato industry's future growth will depend
greatly on the new ``free trade'' agreement with Canada and on U.S.
access to some foreign markets that have small entry quotas for
potatoes.
   The agreement with Canada, which is aimed at wiping out most
trade barriers between the two countries, was approved by Congress
and signed by President Reagan on Sept. 28. It has not yet been
cleared by the Canadian Parliament.
   Some potato industry people have criticized the pact, claiming
it will give Canadian producers an unfair advantage because they
receive price and transportation subsidies from the government.
Growers in the Northeast are generally opposed because of competing
imports of Canadian round, white potatoes. But Western growers are
mostly in favor of the agreement since they export russet potatoes
to Canada.
   The report said South Korea is an example of a fast-growing
economy which could support greater imports of U.S. potato products
if trade restrictions were eased.
   ``The tantalizing taste of increased export potential has been
offered by the example of Japan, which bought 83 percent of U.S.
french fry exports in 1987,'' the report said. ``That represented
more than 70 percent of total 1987 frozen vegetable exports to
Japan.''
   Shannon Hamm, another economist, said U.S. per capita use of
potatoes, on the average, has been fairly constant since 1970. The
big change has been in a shift from fresh to processed potato
products.
   But since 1978, she said, fresh potato use has stabilized with
the baked potato appearing on fast-food menus and the increased use
of microwaves in the home. The use of frozen potatoes, which was
less than half of fresh in 1970, nearly is equal to the use of
fresh potatoes today.
   Lucier, noting the shift toward frozen potatoes, said about 80
percent of those are consumed as french fries.
   ``If the popularity of fast foods continues and a newly
perfected fresh fry vending machine finds favor, continued growth
in frozen use is likely,'' he said.

   Rice exports are expected to gain about 7
percent in the 1988-89 marketing year, rebounding from a 14 percent
decline last season, according to the Agriculture Department.
   Exports for the year that began Aug. 1 are forecast at 2.45
million metric tons, milled rice equivalent, up from 2.29 million
tons in 1987-88, the department's Economic Research Service said
Tuesday in a new outlook report.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. There are slightly more than
22 hundredweight of rice in a ton.

<HEAD>Regulators Approve Plan Designed To Prevent Reoccurrence Of Stock
Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the eve of today's first anniversary of the
October stock market crash, federal regulators approved a plan that
likely would have prevented the 508-point plunge, or at least kept
it from happening all in one day.
   After markets closed on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said they
authorized a one-year experiment providing for coordinated trading
halts _ or circuit breakers _ during steep market dives.
   The plan calls for a one-hour trading halt in the event the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plummets by 250 points or
more from the previous day's closing. A drop of 400 points would
trigger a two-hour trading halt.
   One year ago today, the Dow fell a record 508 points, wiping out
an estimated $500 billion in paper wealth in a single day. Because
most of the crash occurred in the last hour of trading, a circuit
breaker plan such as the one approved Tuesday likely would have
limited the damage to 400 points.
   The New York Stock Exchange, the nation's largest stock market,
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the largest market for trading
stock-index futures, proposed the experiment on July 7.
   Other markets, including the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities
Dealers' over-the-counter system, are joining in.
   Because Congress failed to agree on market reforms this year,
circuit breakers are the most substantive change stemming from the
crash.
   Government approval is effective immediately. It is up to the
exchanges to decide when to begin.
   ``We're ready to implement this as soon as Thursday. We think
this is a very significant action to remedy what problems there
were in the market a year ago,'' said Andrew Yemma, a spokesman for
the Chicago Merc.
   The plan is designed to provide an orderly halt to trading
before one market _ stock or futures _ breaks down, shifting all of
the trading to the remaining market. It is also intended to allow
time for buyers to step in and counter overwhelming sell orders.
   Another part of the plan gives individual investors, as opposed
to pension and mutual funds, preference in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange when the Dow moves either up or down by 25 points.
The rule applies to orders of 2,099 shares and smaller.
   After the crash, many individual investors complained that their
orders were shunted aside, in some cases for hours, while larger
buy and sell orders from institutional investors were executed.
   The market halt plan is one of the key recommendations offered
after the crash by a presidential task force headed by Nicholas
Brady, a New York investment banker who is now Treasury secretary.
   The NASD said earlier this month that it was going along with
the plan only reluctantly because it did not want to be the only
market left open when all others were closed.
   But NASD President Joseph R. Hardiman argued that a
pre-announced trigger for market halts could act as a ``magnet,''
pulling the market down faster. As the market approaches the halt
point, it could be flooded with orders from traders fearful they
will be prevented from selling, he said.
   With the SEC approval, a previous six-month experiment to curb
computerized index arbitrage ends. The earlier program had provided
that when the market moved by 50 points or more, index arbitrage
orders were not allowed through the NYSE's automated trading system.
   Index arbitrage is designed to take advantage of momentary price
discrepancies between the stocks and futures markets. It involves
the buying and selling of massive blocs of stocks and futures
contracts and was criticized for making last year's crash more
precipitous.
   However, the so-called 50-point collar experiment ran counter to
the Brady commission's finding that stock and future markets were
in effect one market and that disconnecting them could be dangerous.
   A new rule taking the place of the collar is aimed at providing
more orderly index arbitrage. When the Standard and Poors 500 index
falls by more than 12 points, the equivalent of 96 points on the
Dow, index arbitrage orders will be shunted into a side file of the
trading computer. If buy and sell orders can be matched, the trades
will go through. If not, trading in individual S&P 500 stocks could
be halted.

<HEAD>Tests Show Soybean Oil Could Supply Fatty Acids Found In Fish Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laboratory tests show the human body rapidly
converts a part of the soybean oil used in some ordinary food
products into the same kinds of fatty acids found in fish oil,
according to an Agriculture Department scientist.
   Chemist Edward A. Emken of the department's Agricultural
Research Service, said healthy people on a typical American diet
may have to look no further than their salad dressing for benefits
that some people are seeking from fish oil capsules.
   Two men in a preliminary study consumed the soybean oil
component, linolenic acid, and within a few hours their bodies had
coverted it into the same omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and
marine oil, he said.
   ``Think of it this way: the body can naturally make its own fish
oil omega-3 fatty acids from the linolenic acid in soybean oil,''
Emken said in a report released Tuesday by the USDA agency.
   Emken led the study at the agency's Northern Regional Research
Center, Peoria, Ill., and was helped in the work by St. Francis
Medical Center, Peoria.
   The report said capsules of fish and marine oils have been
``touted by advertisers and debated by nutrionists'' as dietary
supplements. Whatever the merits, it said, the capsules have become
popular with any consumers hoping to ease or prevent conditions
ranging from heart disease to rheumatoid arthritis.
   ``Our study is the first to show that linolenic acid is rapidly
converted to omega-3 fatty acides found in marine oil,'' Emken
said. ``The study also provides direction for further research to
learn which dietary fatty acids, including those in fish and
soybeans, best meet human nutritional needs.''
   Soybean oil is the only major domestic vegetable oil that
contains much linolenic acid and makes up 79 percent of the
vegetable fats in the average U.S. diet, the report said. The fats
are in such foods as shortening, margarine and cooking oil as well
as in salad dressing.

<HEAD>East Germany Apparently Ready to Pay Some Reparations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist East Germany has agreed to pay some
reparations to Holocaust victims and their families, and is
considering steps to improve ties with Israel, according to the
president of the World Jewish Congress.
   Both steps mark a significant departure from East Germany's
previous policy.
   World Jewish Congress President Edgar M. Bronfman, speaking at
the end of a three-day visit to East Germany, said Tuesday a plan
for East German reparations to Holocaust victims had been completed.
   Bronfman declined to give any details and did not say how much
would be paid out. Heinz Galinski, leader of West Germany's Jewish
community, said earlier that East Germany would pay up to $100
million to Holocaust victims.
   In his news conference, Bronfman referred to an international
Claims Conference backed by the WJC that has handled reparations
issues for Holocaust victims.
   ``I understand that the negotiations that took place between the
(East German) government and the Claims Conference have been
completed,'' Bronfman said. ``They will be lived up to and the
details and communications will be worked out and reported.''
   ``I am completely satisifed with the results,'' he said. ``I
have nothing further to say on the payments question. It is not my
responsibility to discuss the details.''
   Since its founding in 1949, East Germany has argued that it
bears no responsibility for Nazi atrocities because the nation was
born after World War II. It has also stressed that communists had
also suffered under Nazi persecution.
   This summer, however, the government said it would provide
unspecified ``humanitarian aid'' to Holocaust victims.
   State-run media also have reported in recent months on
government efforts to improve relations with East Germany's tiny
Jewish community. There are an estimated 450-600 practicing Jews in
East Germany.
   ``I am totally satisfied on two counts,'' Bronfman said. ``The
first is the one that concerns me the most. That is the moral
position that East Germany is taking on its responsibilities on the
Holocaust. The second point is payment to the sufferers and
survivors.''
   Bronfman, 59, also said he hoped for improved contacts between
East Germany and Israel. The two countries have never had
diplomatic relations and East Germany has been a staunch Arab
supporter.
   During his three-day stay in East Berlin, Bronfman held talks
with East German Communist Party leader Erich Honecker, Foreign
Minister Oskar Fischer and other officials.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Veterans Legislation; Reagan Expected To Sign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's largest block of voters
will receive new status and rights if President Reagan, as
expected, signs into law three major veterans' bills headed for
congressional approval.
   One of the bills, elevating the Veterans Administration to
presidential Cabinet status, is headed for Reagan's desk following
Senate passage by voice vote.
   The other two, also passed Tuesday night by the Senate on voice
votes, must be returned to the House for final votes. But approval
there is considered assured.
   The bills would give veterans, for the first time in 170 years,
the right to have courts review VA decisions denying benefits, and
would provide a package of cost-of-living payment increases to 2.2
million veterans and 310,000 widows and orphans.
   A new Department of Veterans Affairs would be the 14th Cabinet
agency and the fifth created in the past 28 years. It would replace
the VA, the federal government's fifth-largest agency.
   The VA serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or
survivors. Its $30 billion annual budget includes $14 billion
annual payments for income maintenance and $626 million for
education and rehabilitation assistance.
   The agency and its 240,000 employees administer about 90,000
patient beds in 534 health facilities. VA doctors will see about 20
million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and
will bury about 300,000 veterans in the next 12 months.
   The Congressional Budget Office said switching the VA to a
Cabinet department will cost $33 million over five years. Most of
that will go for changing signs on VA buildings.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veterans'
Affairs Committee, said the new department's ``first order of
business'' should be to investigate a deficiency in VA hospital
beds.
   ``Sick veterans are being turned away from VA hospitals across
the country,'' Cranston said, because ``the Reagan administration
misled Congress about the VA's real needs'' and the VA medical
system faces a $635 million budget deficit.
   The appellate review bill creates a new, independent ``U.S.
Court of Veterans Appeals'' to replace the current Board of
Veterans' Appeals. That panel is part of the VA and is now the last
resort of veterans who are unhappy with decisions to reject their
claims.
   Decisions of the new court could be appealed to the existing
U.S. Court of Appeals for the federal circuit on any legal matter,
but not on factual findings.
   The measure also eliminates a Civil War-era law which limits
attorney's fees for veterans' claims to $10 per claim. That made it
difficult for veterans to hire lawyers other than those provided by
the VA.
   The bill is a ``historic advance in veterans' rights,'' Cranston
said.
   On Oct. 3, the House approved somewhat similar legislation by a
400-0 tally, but minor differences between the two bills mean
another House vote is required.
   Before passage, the Senate added an amendment which could
provide interim health care payments to some Vietnam veterans who
were exposed to Agent Orange, a highly toxic defoliant used by U.S.
forces in Southeast Asia.
   The VA would assume that two types of cancer _ non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma _ were caused by Agent Orange.
Veterans could receive benefits while the U.S. government, which
hasn't finally agreed that Agent Orange caused cancer, studies the
problem.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a Vietnam veteran, said Agent Orange
provisions will have ``a very limited effect.''
   ``I find it highly disturbing that those people who went to
fight the VC in Vietnam spend too much fighting the VA back here in
this country,'' Kerry said.
   The Senate also added an amendment to permit the VA to offer
Vietnam-era veterans flight training courses under the auspices the
GI bill.

<HEAD>Ozone Layer Has Suffered More Damage Than Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ozone layer that protects the
earth from excessive solar radiation has suffered twice as much
damage as expected, a United Nations environmental expert says.
   The protective layer in the outer reaches of the earth's
atmosphere is 4 percent thinner than it was in 1986, according to
Dr. Mostafa Tolba, the executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program.
   Last year, scientists predicted this year's reduction would only
be 2 percent, Tolba told reporters Tuesday. He is in the Hague for
a two-week conference on the ozone layer problem.
   The sun's ultraviolet rays reaching the earth's surface
unfiltered by the ozone layer have been linked to a variety of
environmental and health problems ranging from stunted plant growth
to skin cancer in humans.
   It is also held partly responsible for the gradual heating of
the earth's atmosphere known as the ``greenhouse effect.''
   Damage to the ozone layer is mainly caused by a group of
man-made chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, which are
widely used in aerosol cans, refrigerators, air conditioners and
various types of plastic foam used for packaging and insulation.
   The UNEP-organized gathering of scientists from more than 30
nations is the first meeting of its kind since last year's signing
of the Montreal Protocol, which calls for the production of CFCs to
be cut to half its 1986 levels by 1998.
   However, Tolba said chlorofluorocarbons production should
ultimately be cut to 15 percent of those levels or even phased out
completely if there is to be no further damage to the ozone layer.
   Since the late 1970s, the ozone layer, which forms naturally but
is gradually depleted by the emissions, has contained a large hole
over the South Pole.
   Tolba said the hole appeared slightly smaller this year than in
1987, although he added it is normal for its size to fluctuate from
one year to the next. He said climatic factors, and not a lessening
of the CFC problem, were responsible.
   The Netherlands and West Germany, both major CFC-producing
nations, have already called for a complete ban on production of
the dangerous chemicals.
   Under the Montreal Protocol, a review of the ozone layer
situation is scheduled to begin in 1990, but Tolba said that
process will be accelerated and begin next year.
   Later this week, scientists at the conference will discuss the
use of harmless substitutes for CFCs. The conference ends Oct. 28.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says US Would Accept Interim Farm Subsidy Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is willing to consider a
``down payment'' on its ambitious goal of eliminating all farm
subsidies by the year 2000, a U.S. official says.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the Reagan
administration would accept an interim agreement calling for
targets of reducing farm subsidies in 1989 and 1990.
   But he insisted that U.S. negotiators would not go along with
the interim subsidy reductions unless they receive in return a
strong commitment to pursue the total elimination of farm subsidies
as part of the current Uruguay Round of trade talks.
   Those talks, held under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, the international body which governs trade,
began in Uruguay in 1986 and are scheduled to conclude in 1990.
   The 96 nations holding the discussions will meet in Montreal
beginning Dec. 5 for a mid-term negotiating session to review
progress so far and set goals for the next two years.
   ``I believe strongly that a short-term down payment in Montreal
would be highly desirable for everyone,'' Yeutter said. ``It would
set an excellent tone for the final two years of the (Uruguay)
negotiations. It would get the reform process underway.''
   Yeutter said the United States ``is not about to embark on this
proposition unless we also receive a satisfactory commitment to
long-term reform.''
   The $200 billion farm subsidy war has been the most heated topic
of discussions in the trade round. Reagan has called for the
elimination of all subsidies by the end of this century, but most
European countries and Japan have called that goal unrealistic.
   At this year's economic summit in Toronto, the administration
was able to get only an agreement for a watered-down proposal to
work toward reducing subsidies, rather than totally eliminating
them.
   Yeutter, at a briefing for reporters Tuesday, insisted that
America's willingness to accept an interim subsidy reduction was
not a signal that the United States was moderating its position.
   He repeated warnings that Congress could very likely increase
farm export subsidies next year, just as lawmakers did in 1985,
unless progress is made on the farm issue at the Montreal meetings.
   He said a proposal advanced recently by Australia and various
other farm exporting nations provided a useful outline for an
interim agreement.
   That proposal, which addresses reductions in domestic subsidies
to farmers, export subsidies for farm products and market access
for other countries ``is in the ball park of potential short-term
reform and with some alterations and editing between now and
December, my guess is that it could constitute the basis for
short-term reform,'' Yeutter said.

<TEXT>
   The Senate sponsor of a procurement fraud bill
says the legislation's severe penalties would give prosecutors a
powerful new tool to use against defense contractors cheating the
government.
   ``Defense fraud rips off American taxpayers and endangers the
lives of our fighting forces'' by providing them with defective
parts, Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said after the Senate
passed the measure by voice vote Tuesday.
   The bill would allow prosecutors to seek up to $10 million in
fines for large-scale procurement fraud against the U.S. government.
   The bill must return to the House, which earlier approved a
similar version.
   The Defense Department estimates procurement fraud cost
taxpayers $99.1 million for fiscal years 1986 and 1987, Metzenbaum
said, adding, ``This bill gives our government a powerful new
weapon aimed at punishing and deterring defense fraud.''
   A person or corporation would be subject to the penalties if
convicted of a scheme or act to defraud the government in
connection with a contract of at least $1 million. The size of the
fine would be determined by the severity of the offense.
   Conviction for each act of fraud could result in maximum
penalties of $1 million and 10 years in prison. There would be an
overall cap of $10 million for a single defendant.
   The Senate bill would prohibit contractors from recovering legal
fees in proceedings where the contractors were found to engage in
wrongdoing.
   This language was not in the House bill, and that chamber must
concur before the bill can go to President Reagan.
   Current law allows contractors to recover significant amounts of
legal fees from the government as an allowable cost of the contract.
   A whistleblower protection provision allows anyone fired or
punished for furnishing information to the government to sue for
reinstatement, and receive twice the amount of lost pay.
   The measure also would authorize $8 million for more U.S.
attorneys to prosecute fraud cases, and increase the statute of
limitations from the current five years to seven years.

   Actress Robin Givens' tearful discussion with
Barbara Walters about her rocky marriage to boxing champ Mike Tyson
got ABC's ``20-20'' its highest rating since Walters interviewed
Donna Rice last year.
   ``20-20'' ranked 10th in the weekly A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings
with a 17.2 rating. The installment on which Rice appeared last
summer rated an 18.2.
   Otherwise, it was a battle of baseball in last week's top 10.
NBC had the first two games of the World Series between the Oakland
A's and the Los Angeles Dodgers. ABC had the last two games of the
National League championship playoff between the Dodgers and the
New York Mets.
   NBC, which suffered disappointing ratings for its Summer
Olympics coverage, appeared headed for another possible
disappointment when the series became geographically undesirable _
two West Coast teams.
   But the rating for game two, 22.9, was up 5 percent over last
year's game two in the series between Minnesota and St. Louis. Game
one of the World Series and game six of the National League playoff
also made the top 10.
   NBC won the week with a rating of 15.7. ABC had 14.5; CBS 12.4.
   Each rating point measures the percentage of the nation's 90.4
million TV homes.
   ``The Cosby Show'' had a rating of 23.1, lagging below its
performances in previous years, but good enough for No. 1.
   The rest of the top 10 were: ``Oakland vs. Los Angeles Dodgers,
Game 2'' on NBC, ``New York Mets vs. Los Angeles Dodgers, Game 7''
on ABC, ``A Different World'' on NBC, ``Oakland vs. Los Angeles
Dodgers, Game 1'' NBC; ``New York Mets vs. Los Angeles Dodgers,
Game 6'' ABC; ``60 Minutes'' CBS; ``Winnie'' NBC; ``ALF'' NBC; and
``20-20'' ABC.
   ``Winnie'' was NBC's Monday movie, starring Meredith Baxter
Birney as an institutionalized woman who aspires to live life on
her own.
   The ``CBS Evening News'' continued to win the tight news race
with a rating of 10.1. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 9.8
despite baseball pre-emptions. ``NBC Nightly News'' had 9.4.
   The week's lowest-rated prime-time shows were: ``West 57th,''
``A Family Again,'' ``The Ultimate Stuntman,'' ``Sonny Spoon,''
``Destined to Live,'' ``Magical World of Disney,'' ``Live! Dick
Clark Presents,'' ``Incredible Sunday,'' ``All Star Celebration:
The '88 Vote'' and ``America's Favorite Movie.''

   A two-day auction of rare books and manuscripts
from a California seminary, including a 175-year-old edition of
``Pride and Prejudice,'' brought $4.1 million, Christie's auction
house reported.
   The sale from the Edward Laurence Doheny Memorial Library of St.
John's Seminary in Camarillo amassed more than twice the presale
estimate of $1.9 million, Christie's spokeswoman Roberta Maneker
said Tuesday.
   It was estimated, for instance, that the Jane Austen novel
``Pride and Prejudice,'' printed in London in 1813, would be worth
from $4,000 to $6,000 because of worn spines and corners and other
decay. But it brought $49,500.
   The books and manuscripts had been housed in the seminary since
the 1940s. They were left by the will of the late philanthropist
Carrie Estelle Doheny.
   Los Angeles Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony said,
however, that ``the needs of the seminary system of Los Angeles are
such that we can no longer afford the luxury of maintaining a
valuable and little used asset.''

   In a ruling that took the bite out of a
city ordinance, the state Supreme Court overturned the conviction
of a man who was fined $50 for allowing his dog to run free.
   The high court Tuesday unanimously reversed a conviction issued
by a municipal court in Bismarck and upheld by a county court,
saying prosecutors presented no evidence that the pet owner knew of
the violation.
   David Sholy of Bismarck, who acted as his own lawyer before the
Supreme Court, had been convicted of violating a city ordinance
that made it ``unlawful for any owner or keeper of a dog to permit
the animal to be at large.''
   The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the word ``permit''
requires some knowledge of the crime or negligence that led to it.
   ``Because the city introduced no evidence of culpability at the
trial, the conviction is reversed,'' the court said.

<HEAD>War Criminal's Widow Barred From Italy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian authorities say they have barred the widow
of a Nazi war criminal from entering Italy to promote a book about
her husband's escape from prison.
   Annelise Kappler had hoped to tour in connection with the book
that detailed how she helped her husband, Herbert Kappler, flee to
West Germany from a Rome military prison in 1977. He reportedly had
been concealed inside a large trunk.
   Kappler, an SS colonel in Rome during World War II, was
sentenced to life in prison for his role in the reprisal slaying of
335 Italian civilians in 1944. Seventy of the victims were Jews.
   Kappler died of cancer in West Germany a year after his escape.
   Italian officials, including Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti,
a Christian Democrat, and Justice Minister Giuliano Vassalli, spoke
out against the visit, and the Interior Ministry announced Tuesday
she would be turned back at the border as an undesirable if she
tried to enter Italy.
   Mrs. Kappler said Tuesday that she had postponed the trip at
Vassalli's request, but hoped to come to Italy at a future date.
   ``Mr. Vassalli requested in a telegram that I not come out of
respect for those who suffered under the crimes of the Nazis,'' she
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from her home in
Soltau, West Germany.
   Publication of her book will be delayed, her publisher said.
   ``I believe it opportune to take my distance from the
intransigent attitude of Mrs. Kappler and put off the book
presentation until a calmer moment,'' publisher Cesare Ardini was
quoted as saying by the Italian news agency AGI.
   The outcry arose as Italian Jews were holding a convention to
commemorate the racial laws enacted in 1938 by Benito Mussolini's
fascist dictatorship, which foreshadowed deportations to Nazi death
camps.
   The 200 people attending the convention, held in an annex of the
Parliament building, broke into applause when a message denouncing
the visit by Kappler's widow was received from Nilde Iotti, the
Communist speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.
   ``The gesture of Mrs. Kappler, who wants to exalt the figure of
her Nazi criminal husband, is a challenge to the human conscience
and the Italian people,'' Ms. Iotti's message said.
   Tullia Zevi, president of the Union of Italian Jewish
Communities, which represents the country's 35,000 to 40,000 Jews,
praised the intervention by Italian officials and said Mrs. Kappler
was ``trying to make a mockery of Italian justice.''
   Mrs. Zevi said she sees the Kappler book, an attempt to justify
her husband's role and the reason she spirited him out of the
country, as part of a trend to rewrite the history of World War II
and relegate the suffering of the Jews to no more than an accident
of the war.
   She said the convention is aimed at recalling the Italian
legislation so that today any such laws can be be fought ``no
matter under what form they are presented.''

   The U.S. Food for Peace program is expected to
provide less grain and other items to needy countries in the next
year because of higher commodity prices.
   Acting Undersecretary of Agriculture Richard W. Goldberg said
Tuesday that allocations for the 12 months that began Oct. 1 total
about 3 million metric tons of grain equivalent valued at $663
million.
   Under the program a year ago, allocations totaled 4.4 million
tons of food commodities worth $648 million.
   Goldberg said $139.5 million in unallocated funds has been set
aside as a reserve to provide commodities ``for unforeseen needs''
during the year. Last year the reserve was $85.6 million.

   West Germany should either prosecute an
alleged Nazi collaborator or send him to the Soviet Union ``so he
can be held accountable for his crimes,'' two Jewish activists say
in a letter to the West German ambassador to the United Nations.
   ``It would be an injustice to allow Boleslavs Maikovskis to
escape punishment for his crimes,'' wrote Brooklyn, N.Y., District
Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman and Menachem Rosensaft, founding
chairman of the International Network of Children of Holocaust
Survivors.
   Maikovskis, 83, fled the United States for West Germany, where
he has asked for political asylum, West Germany authorities said
Tuesday. He had been living in Mineola, N.Y., since 1951, but had
been slated for deportation since 1986.
   As chief a Nazi-created police force in Latvia during World War
II, Maikovskis he allegedly ordered the mass arrest of residents in
the village of Audrini. The letter said all the villagers were
later killed.
   In 1965, the Soviet Union sentenced Maikovskis to death in

<HEAD>Dukakis Pledges to Wipe Out Trade Deficit; Bush Battles Notion
Race is Over</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Bush speech at 11 a.m. EDT; Dukakis event at 11:30 a.m.; Top
planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis promised to erase the nation's $150 billion
trade deficit in four years as the Democratic nominee waged his
uphill fight for the presidency. Republican front-runner George
Bush claimed the underdog label in his battle with the notion that
the race for the White House is over.
   Dukakis portrayed the election as a choice between a candidate
for the wealthy and a nominee who is committed to working class
Americans as he took his case to voters in Michigan.
   The Democratic nominee received an enthusiastic response Tuesday
in Kalamazoo when he told the crowd, ``George Bush cares about the
people on Easy Street. I care about the people on Main Street. He's
on their side. I'm on your side.''
   Dukakis also accused the Republican administration of failing to
halt the growing trade deficit and doing nothing to solve the
problems that led to the 1987 stock market crash, which occurred
one year ago today.
   The vice president, who traveled to Fulton, Mo., site of former
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famed ``Iron Curtain''
speech, focused on U.S.-Soviet relations in his address at
Westminister College.
   But in opening remarks to the students and comments to
reporters, Bush sought to convince listeners he doesn't have the
presidential election in hand.
   ``The worst thing to do would be to show a complacency I don't
feel or an overconfidence that I do not feel,'' said the GOP
nominee, who led by 17 points over in this week's NBC News-Wall
Street Journal poll.
   A Dukakis aide, however, said a new Harris poll put the gap at
about nine percentage points. Barbara Winkour, a spokeswoman for
Louis Harris & Associates in New York, said Harris would be
releasing a poll today, but declined to comment Tuesday on its
results.
   Two other surveys found Bush leads of about that size. In the
first poll of 1,002 registered voters surveyed Saturday through
Monday, Bush led 49-39 percent. The second poll of 1,201 likely
voters Friday through Monday gave the GOP ticket a 49-40 percent
lead.
   Both were ongoing tracking polls _ in which the newest day's
result is added and the last day's is dropped _ done by KRC
Communications Research in Cambridge, Mass. They had margin of
errors of three percentage points either way.
   Front-runner Bush was stressing his foreign policy themes today
at a series of appearances in Dearborn, Royal Oak and Saginaw,
Mich. The industrial state, with its 20 electoral votes, is a key
battleground.
   Dukakis was traveling through rural areas of Illinois and
Missouri, visiting a farm in Hull, Ill., and attending a livestock
auction in Mexico, Mo. The Democratic nominee is hoping to break
the Republican lock on the rural vote in a year in which the farm
economy has suffered.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen was
spending his second day in California, the biggest electoral prize
with 47 votes. Republican Dan Quayle was campaigning in Missouri
and West Virginia.
   Bensten, who has hinted at dissatisfaction with his running
mate's limited response to GOP attacks, accused the Republican
ticket of a ``vicious campaign that violates the public trust.''
   ``They've said things about Mike Dukakis that in Texas we
wouldn't say about a rattlesnake on a lawn at a church picnic,''
Bentsen told about 2,000 students at the University of California
at Los Angeles.
   For his part, Dukakis lashed out at Bush, charging that his
rival has ``no convictions, no ideas, no plans.''
   ``We've got to end the Republican rainbow coalition of red ink
for our children, pink slips for our workers, greenmail for sharp
operators on Wall Street and golden parachutes for top corporate
executives,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor said his solution to the trade
deficit would be to reduce the budget deficit, increase foreign
trade, invest in education and training and place a greater
emphasis on research and development.
   While the candidate stepped up the offensive on the campaign
trail, Dukakis' ad chief said the campaign is releasing a network
television ad today criticizing Bush's plan to make Quayle the
nation's drug czar.
   ``If George Bush couldn't handle the job, how do you think Dan
Quayle is gonna do?'' the ad asks.
   The vice president, expanding on his own campaign ad suggesting
that only the Republican nomine is experienced enough to negotiate
with the Soviets, told the Fulton audience he would remain wary of
Soviet intentions despite the reforms instituted under the
leadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the
Soviet Union,'' Bush said.
   Questioned about his claim that he will ``campaign like an
underdog,'' Bush said that his staff ``will not lighten up. We're
going to stay right down to the wire. ... If I find anybody letting
up in my campaign, they're history.''
   Quayle also was warning against overconfidence, but was upbeat
after greeting cheering college students in Illinois.
   ``I'm beginning to feel what it's going to be like on election
night,'' Quayle said.

   Shimon Peres' Labor Party, which has pledged to
return some occupied territory in exchange for peace, actually
plans to keep West Bank land where the Arab population is growing
fastest, a newly released study says.
   The U.S.-financed study by respected Israeli researcher Meron
Benvenisti also said some 1.75 million Arabs live in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, 250,000 more than Israel's latest figure
of 1.5 million.
   Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, told a news
conference that Arab living conditions in the territories have
deteriorated during Israel's 21-year occupation, in contrast to
Israeli claims.
   He blamed the hardships for spurring the 10-month-old
Palestinian uprising, during which more than 300 Arabs and six
Israelis have died.
   ``If you take indicators like the number of hospital beds per
1,000 Palestinians, the length of road per capita, even the amount
of water, the situation is worse,'' said Benvenisti, whose study,
``The West Bank and Gaza Atlas,'' was financed by the Ford and
Rockefeller foundations.
   ``From land expropriation to the pitiful planning to ... the
dual system of infrastructure available for Arabs versus Jewish
settlers ... Here you can find the reasons for the intefadeh,''
Benvenisti said, using the Arabic word for ``uprising.''
   Benvenisti said the left-leaning Labor Party's announced plan to
return parts of the West Bank to Arab control would keep for Israel
large areas where the Palestinian population is growing fastest.
   ``These areas are precisely the areas where the fastest growth
of both Arab and Jewish population have occurred,'' he said, adding
that more job opportunities were causing the expansion.
   According to Labor's plan, about half of the West Bank would be
kept by Israel, including the Arab cities of Ramallah and
Bethlehem, the 50-mile-long Jordan Valley and all of the
territory's 118 Jewish settlements.
   The area Labor would return includes the largest Arab cities of
Nablus and Hebron, as well as Tulkarem, Jenin and Jericho, the
researcher said.
   The rival Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, which
faces Labor in Nov. 1 parliamentary elections, opposes returning
any occupied territory.
   Among the evidence Benvenisti cited to show a decline in West
Bank living conditions was a drop in the number of hospital beds.
He said there were 2.15 beds per 1,000 Arabs in 1970 as compared to
1.8 beds per 1,000 in 1983.
   He also said Palestinians have less water than West Bank Jewish
settlers, as reflected in consumption statistics.
   In 1982, he said, annual water consumption per capita was 15
cubic meters for village Arabs, 35 cubic meters for Arabs in towns,
and 90 cubic meters for Jewish settlers.
   Shlomo Khayat, co-author of the study, noted Palestinian anger
also grows when Israel's lack of planning leads to such practical
problems as delays in granting building permits.
   ``This is why you see so many Arab buildings going up illegally
and then being demolished by the Israeli authorities,'' he said.

   Heavy rains and whirlwinds have struck
central Vietnam in recent days, killing at least 26 people, news
reports say.
   The storm ruined more than 247,000 acres of fields and pulled
down nearly 2,500 houses as it tore through a stretch from Thanh
Hoa to Phu Khanh provinces, the official Vietnam News Agency said
in a report broadcast Tuesday and seen in Bangkok today.
   Many roads and railway lines were damaged, the report said.
   The official domestic Radio Hanoi said Tuesday that flashfloods
due to swelling rivers submerged many houses and 10 people drowned
in Nghe Tinh province, where the floods affected some 230,000
people.
   Flooding levels in the province's Lam River neared record highs
on Monday and were expected to rise Tuesday, the broadcast said.
The Central Floods and Typhoons Control Committee has ordered
authorities there to protect the major reservoirs and dams.
   Badly hit was Dai Loc district of Quang Nam-Danang province,
where floods and whirlwinds killed 12 people, the radio said. It
reported that 832 houses and classrooms and 82,000 acres of rice
and other crops were destroyed.
   Earlier Vietnamese media reports indicated that the storms began
early last week.
   Tropical storms, some of typhoon force, annually cause
considerable loss of life and damage in Vietnam, one of the world's
poorest nations. Last year, northern Vietnam also was plagued by
what the government said were severe food shortages due to a
prolonged drought.

   Share prices rebounded moderately Wednesday on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the dollar fell against the Japanese
yen.
   The dollar closed at 126.85 yen, down 0.85 yen from Tuesday's
close of 127.70 yen. Opening at 127.15 yen, the currency moved
lower while ranging between 126.85 and 127.60 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Exchange of 225 selected issues, which lost
126.76 points the previous day, regained 151.69 points, or 0.56
percent, to close at 27,293.67, compared to Tuesday's closing at
27,141.98 points.
   News reports predicting lower interest rates on
government-issued bonds and an apparent lack of opposition by the
Bank of Japan spurred buying on the stock exchange Wednesday, said
a dealer with Daiwa Securities.
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business and financial
daily, reported that interest rates on 10-year government bonds to
be issued in November will be trimmed to 4.8 or 4.9 percent from
the current 5.0 percent.
   When interest rates fall, share prices normally rise because
investors funnel their money out of the credit market and into the
stock market, the dealer said.
   In foreign exchange trading, potential dollar-sellers were
discouraged by another Nihon Keizai Shimbun report that said the
Japanese and U.S. central banks were willing to coordinate action
if the dollar falls to the 125-yen level, traders said.

<HEAD>Mount St. Helens Approaches Two Years Without A Burp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mount St. Helens is approaching a landmark of
sorts: two full years without any new blasts of smoke and ash, or
even burps of lava.
   The last ``eruptive episode'' occurred Oct. 21-24, 1986, when
the southwest Washington volcano added a new lobe to the top of the
lava dome that sits in its gaping crater.
   The dome remains dwarfed by the cavernous crater, even though it
has built to a height of 875 feet above the crater floor.
   The volcano first stirred to life in this century in March 1980,
when it began venting steam and ash from its peak. Its May 18,
1980, eruption leveled 230 square miles of evergreen forest, left
57 people dead or missing and sent up an ash cloud that circled the
globe.
   It also knocked the top 1,300 feet off the peak, which is now
8,365 feet high.
   Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey cautioned, however,
that the quiet period does not necessarily mean the volcano has
lapsed into long-term inactivity.
   ``Mount St. Helens could erupt again at any time,'' said Don
Swanson, scientist in charge at the USGS observatory in Vancouver,
Wash.
   Throughout its recorded history, Mount St. Helens has had active
periods that lasted for years with relatively short spans of
inactivity. Before the 1980s, the last eruptive period was from
1800 to 1857, with intermittent periods of quiet lasting months or
years, according to the USGS western region office in Menlo Park,
Calif.
   The volcano's most recent eruptions have been quiet,
dome-building affairs, in which the mountain pumps out thick lava
to increase the size of the crater dome. Swanson said, however,
that explosive eruptions such as those in the spring and summer of
1980 remain possible.
   The last eruption added about 3 million cubic yards of material
to the dome, which now contains about 101 million cubic yards of
cooled lava and other volcanic material.
   Seismic activity also has decreased at the mountain, Swanson
said. The volcano and surrounding area are continuously monitored
for earthquake activity by a joint USGS-University of Washington
program.
   Since October 1986, seismic activity has remained at
``background levels,'' scientists said.
   Sulfur dioxide gas continues to escape from cracks in the lava
dome, but has also remained at inconsequential levels of less than
50 tons a day, Swanson said.
   By monitoring seismic activity and other signals, scientists
have correctly predicted 16 of the volcano's 17 dome-building
episodes.

<TEXT>
   An Indian Airlines jetliner with 135
people on board crashed Wednesday and exploded in central India and
130 people died, authorities said.
   The Indian Airlines jet slammed to the ground at 7:40 a.m.
(10:10 p.m. EDT Tuesday) on its final approach to Ahmadabad
airport, about 300 miles southwest of New Delhi, according to Capt.
J.D. Rao, operations manager of Indian Airlines in Bombay.
   The plane made more than one attempt to land, said G.K. Rawal,
police inspector at the airport. Rawal said 130 bodies had been
recovered and that five survivors had been taken to hospitals.
   Airline officials said there are several foreigners aboard the
plane, but they did not know their nationalities.
   Authorities did not know immediately what caused the crash of
the Boeing 737, flying to Ahmadabad from Bombay with 129
passengers, including five children, and a crew of six.
   However, Rawal said, the plane was attempting to land in heavy
fog. Airport workers were searching for the plane's ``black box,''
he said.
   There were conflicting reports about the crash.
   An Ahamadabad airport controller said the jet had started its
final approach when it crashed near an industrial area and
exploded. He said no one on the ground was hurt.
   Rawal said the plane exploded in the air.
   News reports said the aircraft suddenly fell from the sky, hit a
tree and then a high-voltage power line and exploded. The wreckage
and bodies were scattered in a field near an industrial area,
reports said.
   Airline officials said the company's managing director, Gerry
Pais, and the federal minister of civil aviation, Shiv Raj Patil,
had gone to the crash site.
   Ahmadabad is about 220 miles from the Pakistan border in Gujarat
state.
   The aircraft, acquired in 1971, is one of the oldest in the
airline's fleet.
   Indian Airlines, the domestic carrier, has come fire recently
for its poor management and maintenance record and frequent delays.
Wednesday's crash was the 16th by an Indian Airlines carrier in the
past 25 years.
   ``Any loss is bad. All crashes are the worst and most
unfortunate,'' said A.K. Vashist, an Indian Airlines spokesman in
New Delhi, the company's headquarters.
   On June 19, an Indian Airlines plane crashed at New Delhi
airport, but everyone on board survived. An investigation showed
the pilot forgot to lower the plane's landing gear.
   On Jan. 1, 1978, 213 people were killed when an Air India jet en
route to the Middle East kingdom of Dubai crashed less than two
minutes after taking off from Bombay.
   In Seattle, Tom Cole of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said an
investigator for the manufacturer was en route to the crash scene
from Bombay.
   Boeing 737s have come under increasingly scrutiny since an Aloha
Airlines aircraft broke apart in April while in flight and made a
miraculous landing with a 20-foot section missing from the top of
the fuselage.
   This week, National Transportation and Safety Board officials
revealed that a foot-long crack and 29 smaller ones were found on a
Continental Airlines 737 as it was stripped for repainting on Oct.
5.
   NTSB chairman James Kolstad called it ``chilling discovering.''
The Aloha plane was No. 152 off the Boeing assembly line and the
Continental was No. 170.
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued an order in May that
all older Boeing 737s, those with at least 30,000 cycles, undergo a
special visual inspection for cracking.
   The Indian airlines plane was the 271st off the assembly line
and company records indicate it was delivered in December 1970,
Cole said.
   In a telephone interview from his home, he said it was
impossible to determine immediately whether any trouble had been
reported earlier about the plane because those records were
available only at company offices.
   Cole said initial reports received by Boeing indicated the plane
was 1,700 feet above the ground 10 miles from the Ahmadabad airport
but added that he was skeptical because ``that's much too low ...
it could even by a typographical error.''
   The pilot might have been trying to duck beneath the fog or
could have descended to that level and then climbed higher again
before the final landing approach, ``but that's all just
speculation,'' Cole said.

<HEAD>Six Injured By Car Bombs In Affluent Neighborhood</HEAD>

   Two car bombs apparently set
off by leftist guerrillas exploded in an affluent neighborhood of
this capital. Rescue workers said six people were injured.
   Although there was no claim of responsibility, the bombings
Tuesday night appeared to mark an escalation in the employment of
the car-bomb tactic by urban commandos.
   The previous three car bombs this year were primarily incendiary
devices. The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front claimed
responsibility for those bombings. A nine-year civil war pits the
Marxist-led guerrillas against forces of the U.S.-backed centrist
government.
   The latest bombs were powerful, blowing one vehicle to bits and
throwing parts of another onto a 20-foot-high roof. The bombs
exploded about two minutes apart.
   One went off in the parking lot of the ``Biggest'' fast-food
hamburger chain, which is Salvadoran-owned but imitates American
restaurants. It shattered windows and destroyed part of the roof.
   The other exploded 200 yards away in front of a complex of
boutiques and stores catering primarily to the wealthy in the
Escalon neighborhood on San Salvador's western edge.
   The rebels' clandestine radio indicated in an Oct. 7 broadcast
that urban commandos would increase activity in such areas.
   ``There is no more tranquil rear-guard for the exploiters,'' the
broadcast said. ``Because it is not fair that bombs and explosions
are heard only in the countryside, in the hamlets of the poor. .. .
It is not fair that only the oppressed hear the noise of the war
and suffer its consequences.
   ``The rich are in this war too.''
   Rescue worker Miguel Angel Torres said five employees were
injured by flying glass at the ``Biggest.'' Another rescue worker
said one person was slightly injured by flying glass at the other
bombing site.
   Torres said two of the injured might lose their eyesight.
   Nicolas Salume, owner of the ``Biggest,'' said about 40 people
were inside the building when the bomb went off. He estimated
damage at $100,000.
   A man outside the Biggest said, ``This is a great injustice. It
is terrorism.'' He declined to be named, saying he was an
industrialist and could become a guerrilla target if publicly
identified.

<TEXT>
   The chief prosecution witness at the
divorce-fixing conspiracy trial of former Miss America Bess Myerson
admitted deceiving a grand jury and deliberately taping her own
mother, a co-defendant, for prosecutors.
   The fifth day of testimony by Sukhreet Gabel in U.S. District
Court on Tuesday was marked by stormy exchanges between Ms. Gabel
and Miss Myerson's lawyer during cross-examination.
   The lawyer, Frederick P. Hafetz, continued to chip away at the
credibility of the 39-year-old witness in the trial of her mother,
former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel; Miss Myerson and
Miss Myerson's lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso.
   Mrs. Gabel presided over the divorce trial of Capasso. The
former justice, 75, Miss Myerson, 64, and Capasso, 43, are charged
with a scheme to cut Capasso's support payments to his estranged
wife, Nancy. In exchange, prosecutors claim, Ms. Gabel was given a
$19,000-a-year city job by Miss Myerson, who was then the city's
cultural affairs commissioner.
   On Tuesday, Hafetz asked Ms. Gabel whether discrepancies in her
grand jury testimony meant she had committed perjury. She shot
back, ``I would request a copy of Black's law dictionary before I
am required to answer that question.''
   The reply of the highly educated witness prompted chuckles from
spectators, and even the judge, who defined perjury for her.
   Later, Hafetz _ his voice rising _ stated, ``You taped your own
mother purposefully.'' He added, ``Did you record your own mother
with a recorder supplied by courtesy of the U.S. government in June
of 1987? Yes or no, ma'am? Yes or no?''
   ``I recorded a conversation with my mother,'' she said, balking
at a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer.
   Judge John F. Keenan asked the question again.
   ``Yes,'' she replied.
   ``That wasn't hard, was it, Ms. Gabel?'' asked Hafetz, prompting
a smile from the witness and the comment, ``It wasn't painless.''
   Under questioning by prosecutors last week, Ms. Gabel testified
that when she learned her mother was presiding over Capasso's
divorce, she confronted her father over the telephone and was told,
``Let your mother handle this. She knows all about it.''
   But under questioning by Hafetz, Ms. Gabel conceded she did not
mention the conversation in three appearances before the grand jury
and several depositions to prosecutors.
   ``I knew I wasn't telling the truth, I was fully cognizant of
it,'' she said.
   ``You deliberately and consciously and intentionally omitted
information when you testified before the grand jury, isn't that
correct?'' asked Hafetz.
   ``Entirely correct,'' the witness replied.
   Hafetz is trying to prove that Ms. Gabel is an unreliable
witness, and yet is intelligent and capable enough to have deserved
the city job on her own merits. Otherwise, it might appear Miss
Myerson gave her the post to curry favor with her mother.
   On Monday, Ms. Gabel, admitted to being treated for clinical
depression and did not disagree when Hafetz suggested that
electro-shock treatments she had received ``made your memory
selective, like a swiss cheese with holes in it.''
   After Tuesday's session ended, Mrs. Gabel came up to the witness
stand and spoke with her daughter, who leaned forward. Before
leaving, Mrs. Gabel blew her daughter a kiss.
   The trial resumes Tuesday. Keenan ordered the delay so he could
attend a judicial conference.

   Soviet and American officials watched the
destruction of the first U.S. cruise missile under the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and looked to future arms
control pacts.
   ``The INF treaty is one of the most critical steps in the
direction of ending the Cold War,'' army Major Gen. Vladimir
Medvedev, head of the Soviet on-site inspection agency, said
through an interpreter Tuesday. ``What we saw today was a critical
step in that direction.
   ``I think it's very important for our people to feel more
secure, and I think such acts will make us much closer,'' Medvedev
said after U.S. military personnel used handheld power saws and an
arc torch to slice up the first missile and its protective canister.
   U.S. officials hoped to finish destroying 41 cruise missiles and
41 canisters, as well as seven mobile launchers, within a few days
at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.
   ``On-site inspections will result in more contacts between the
two (countries') militaries, more knowledge and hopefully more
understanding,'' said Medvedev's U.S. counterpart, Brig. Gen.
Roland Lajoie. ``And this, in turn, should generate more confidence
and predictability in our relations.''
   Lajoie said there has been far less tension than expected in the
115 U.S. inspections of Soviet sites spelled out in the missile
treaty and 31 inspections of U.S. sites by Soviets. He said there
has been ``a lot of flexibility and an amazing amount of good will
on both sides.''
   Medvedev and 10 other Soviet inspectors watched Tuesday as
workers made two full-length cuts in the first 23-foot aluminum
canister with power saws, then sliced the first missile the same
way with saws and a torch. The missile and the canister split in
half as they were raised by a forklift.
   The workers and inspectors then turned their attention to a
56-foot, 78,000-pound mobile launcher.
   The missile, a 21-foot weapon built in 1986 by McDonnell-Douglas
Astronautics Co., was flight tested at the Army's Dugway Proving
Ground in Utah and deployed at an Air Force station in Sicily
before being shipped to Davis-Monthan in February.
   Nuclear warheads have been removed from each of the weapons
slated for destruction, then turned over to the Energy Department,
said Capt. Kendell Pease, a spokesman for the Defense Department's
On-Site Inspection Agency.
   Fuel and guidance equipment have also been removed from each
weapon before dismantling, Pease added.
   During their stay, the Soviets are being escorted by 22
officials from the inspection agency and Davis-Monthan.
   Within the first three years of the 13-year treaty, 443 cruise
missiles, most of which were deployed in Great Britain and Europe,
are slated for destruction.
   The treaty, signed last December by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, also calls for elimination of 169
shorter-range Pershing I-A and 234 Pershing II missiles deployed in
West Germany.
   The pact requires elimination of all land-based nuclear missiles
with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles. Cruise missiles, which cruises
close to the ground and can be launched from planes, the ground or
submarines, have a range of about 1,500 miles.
   Officials said 58 Pershing missile stages were eliminated
between Sept. 8 and Friday at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in
Karnack, Texas. Each Pershing has two stages.
   The Army destroyed its first Pershing launcher in West Germany
earlier Tuesday, Lajoie said.
   As of Friday, the Soviet Union had eliminated 277 missiles under
the treaty, which calls for the destruction of 1,846 missiles in
all.
   The INF treaty is the first to allow on-site inspection and is
seen as a trial for the proposed Stategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   That pact would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear
weapons by 30 to 50 percent and require more complex procedures for
verification.

   Here are facts and figures on Yugoslavia's six republics and two
autonomous provinces:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia has 23 million people. It has three official
languages _ Serbo-Croat, Slovenian and Macedonian _ and at least 20
different ethnic groups.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Slovenia: A northern republic bordering Austria and Italy, is
home to most of Yugoslavia's 1.7 million Slovenes. It has the most
prosperous economy of Yugoslavia's six republics, with 8 percent of
the national population accounting for 24 percent of national
exports.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Croatia: The second most developed Yugoslav republic, has
resisted any attempt by Serbs to dominate Yugoslavia. It is home to
4.4 million Croats, and with Slovenia has most of country's Roman
Catholics. It was the birthplace of Communist Yugoslavia's founding
father, the late Josip Broz Tito.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Bosnia-Herzegovina: The central Yugoslav republic, has most of
the country's 1.9 million Moslims, who became Moslim during five
centures of Turkish domination. Serbs and Croats are other major
ethnic groups in the republic.
   The capital is Sarajevo, where World War I was was started with
the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, in June 1914.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Serbia: The country's largest republic, is home to most of the
8.1 million Serbs. The Serbian kingdom dominated Yugoslavia prior
to World War II, but has since been divided into the Serbian
republic proper and the two autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and
Kosovo.
   Serbia is a largely agricultural republic and its capital,
Belgrade, is also the federal capital and the country's largest
city, with a population of 1.5 million.
   The autonomous provinces of Serbia are:
   Vojvodina: Northeast of Belgrade, borders Hungary and Romania
and is home to a half million Hungarians and some 170,000 Romanians
in addition to the Serb majority. It is known as the breadbasket of
Yugoslavia because of its fertile plains.
   Kosovo: The province bordering Communist Albania is Yugoslavia's
most ethnically troubled region. It was the heart of Serbia's
medieval empire and is the site of some of the oldest monasteries
of the Serbian Orthodox church.
   It is dominated today by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of Kosovo's 2 million population, and are Moslims as a
result of Turkish domination. Thousands of Serbs and Montenegrins
from the Christian Slav majority have left Kosovo since ethnic
riots there in 1981 killed at least nine people.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Macedonia: Yugoslavia's southernmost and poorest republic is
home to most of the country's 1.3 million Macedonians. Most of its
meager earnings come from agriculture and its state-run industrial
enteprises are largely unprofitable.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Montenegro: A mountainous republic bordered by Albania at its
southernmost tip, has some earnings from tourism along the Adriatic
coast. It is home to some 600,000 Montenegrins, who in medieval
times had their own independent state but later adopted the Serbian
Orthodox religion. Yugoslavia's second poorest republic, it was
part of Serbia before World War II.

   Hunched over a workbench in a tiny
shack, biologist Geoff Carroll meticulously records the
surrealistic sounds of whales surfacing and breathing less than 100
yards away.
   Hooked to the portable tape deck next to him is a hydrophone
submerged in a pool surrounded by ice. With astonishing clarity
come the sounds of splashes, the whales' whooshing exhalations, and
occasional grinding static when the barnacle-covered skin of one of
the whales grates against the hydrophone.
   With public and media attention focused on the plight of three
California gray whales stranded in unusually early ice in the
Beaufort Sea, Carroll and his colleagues at the North Slope Borough
are trying to take advantage of an almost unprecedented scientific
opportunity.
   ``Seldom do you get the chance to study whales in the wild under
such ideal conditions,'' says Carroll as he logs the times the
whales surface and their rates of respiration.
   The closeup and relatively long-term study of the whales is
being made possible by their failure to leave their summer feeding
grounds promptly. For nearly two weeks, the whales have been
alternating between two small breathing holes about 75 yards apart.
   The whales, one of them more than 30 feet long, haven't been
inclined to use their bulk to break through the ice. When they were
first trapped, it was only a few inches thick. Now it is more than
one foot.
   ``They could do it if they just would,'' Carroll said of their
icebreaking potential.
   Larger bowhead whales, which arrive in the ice-choked Arctic
Ocean earlier and leave later, regularly break through several feet
of ice to breath.
   Outside, a few fingers of northern lights streak the
star-studded sky. A bonechilling wind persists against the
foam-insulated plywood walls of the ``sled shed,'' which was
dragged into position by a snowmobile.
   The primitive structure is warmed by a small space heater to
keep the equipment from freezing.
   A shotgun loaded with slugs hangs on a nearby hook. Before
stepping outside, the biologists scan the vicinity with a
flashlight, looking for the telltale green eyes of a polar bear.
The great white bears regularly hunt open water like this to nab
unwary seals or sticken whales.
   In the darkness, the sudden surfacing of a whale is startling,
its warm, moist breath palpable to anyone standing along the edge
of the ice.
   In the shed, the splashes and breath sounds are interrupted by
occasional moans and grunts _ vocalizations, the biologists call
them.
   ``Sometimes, they'll make a noise like a drum roll, like someone
beating on a bongo drum or a steel drum,'' he said, tapping his
fingers on the workbench to illustrate.
   But Carroll is surprised at how quiet the gray whales are
compared to the more loquacious bowheads.
   ``It is sort of fortunate that bowheads vocalize as much as they
do, or we could never count them acoustically. If they were as
quiet as these guys, it (acoustical counting) would be of no use at
all.''
   The bowheads are what the borough biologists are most familiar
with and interested in. The bowheads, up to 60 feet long, are the
staple of the traditional subsistence diet of the Eskimos.
   When international pressure threatened to end all whaling, the
borough and the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission began intensive
census studies to demonstrate there was an adequate bowhead
population to sustain limited subsistence whaling.
   But the biologists are more than willing to study the smaller
gray whales, an endangered species.
   ``It's interesting. It's a freak occurrence,'' says biologist
Craig George. ``I'm not sure how much it's going to add to gray
whale biology. And I'm not sure how much it's going to help us down
the road. But we're interested all the same.''

<HEAD>15 Minutes Of Beethoven Gets Mixed Reception</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-minute piece of music apparently
reconstructed from fragments Beethoven wrote for a Tenth Symphony
that he never finished received mixed reviews today from critics.
   The piece was the result of five years' work by Barry Cooper, a
researcher at Aberdeen University in Scotland. Played by Britain's
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, and conducted by Walter
Weller, it had its public premiere Tuesday night at a concert at
London's Royal Festival Hall.
   Edward Greenfield, writing in the London newspaper The Guardian,
wrote: ``Though even Dr. Cooper would never assert that it was what
Beethoven would finally have delivered ... I marvel that the long
Andante sections which framed this unexpectedly structured movement
are so genuinely Beethovenian.''
   Paul Griffiths of The Times of London wrote: ``Proper judgment
of how Dr. Barry Cooper has interpreted Beethoven's presumed
sketches for a presumed Tenth Symphony will have to await
publication of the score: his statement that `about two-thirds of
it is based directly on Beethoven's sketches' begs an awful lot of
questions, especially when we are concerned with a composer of such
notoriously untidy working habits.''
   Anthony Payne wrote in another London paper, The Independent:
``The audience was only mildly enthusiastic. In truth, the music
sounded half-formed.''
   Payne added: ``There has always been speculation about sketches
for a Tenth Symphony. Until the mid-1980s, however, no scholar had
been prepared to identify much material from the 8,000 or so pages
of sketches which Beethoven left at his death (in 1827) as possibly
relating to the mythical Tenth.''
   Violinist Sir Yehudi Menuhin, who conducted the second half of
the concert after the piece was played, said: ``I think it is a
valuable work. It is certainly Beethoven. I have huge admiration
and respect for Dr. Cooper, who has done an extremely good job.''
   Cooper told reporters the years researching the musical mystery
uncovered sketches that ``struck me as being particularly good,
even by Beethoven's standards.''
   He said Beethoven's plans to finish the symphony were mentioned
in a letter written eight days before his death. ``He actually
offered it to the Royal Philharmonic Society'' of Britain, Cooper
said, ``And now they've got it, or as much as there is of it.''
   Cooper added, ``I think the overall result has got enough really
good Beethoven in it to make it very well worth hearing.''

<TEXT>
   A convicted murderer who escaped from
prison in 1974 while on weekend furlough and was arrested 14 years
later as a popular Southern California businessman and part-time
actor has been returned to Massachusetts.
   Arthur Bembury, 37, was back in state prison in Walpole on
Tuesday, expressing surprise at his luck in avoiding detection
during his years on the run.
   Bembury was sentenced to life in prison in June 1971 after being
convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his girlfriend's
mother. Police said he shot the woman after she told him he could
no longer see his 14-year-old girlfriend.
   Bembury said he fled on his fifth weekend furlough in 1974 on a
bus to Washington, D.C.
   ``I remember when I saw the state police outside one day, I said
I am not going to come back if I can help it,'' he recalled. ``I
was trying to get away from the system. It wasn't safe. They didn't
have control of the system, and a life could be bought for two
packs of cigarettes.''
   He was regarded as a model citizen during his second life in
Southern California, where he was known as Doug Henare, a
successful real estate broker in Marina del Rey, a fashionable Los
Angeles suburb, and a part-time actor who had a bit part in the
recent movie ``Colors.''
   Friends said Bembury was a tireless volunteer who helped
troubled youngsters.
   ``I had decided in my mind that I was no longer Arthur Bembury.
I was Douglas Henare,'' Bembury said. ``You have to become another
person if you're going to stay out there.''
   He escaped detection despite being fingerprinted several times,
including an arrest on rape charges, which were dismissed.
   Over the years, Bembury moved into the administration of the
American Youth Foundation, a treatment center for abused and
neglected children, opened another group home, earned a college
degree and pursued his career.
   He was not arrested until a tipster led Los Angeles police a few
months ago to the Santa Monica real estate office where Bembury
worked.
   Despite thinking that his secret would be revealed, Bembury
didn't tell anyone, including the woman he lived with for more than
a decade and the three children he had with her.
   ``But it was for their own benefit. If they knew, they might
have been charged with harboring a fugitive,'' he said. Yet he
added that he was emotionally torn.
   ``When you value what you have so much, you want to keep it,''
Bembury said. ``You want to be legitimate, totally legitimate.
Several times, really more than that, I thought of turning myself
in.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate for president who
was not governor at the time of Bembury's escape, signed the
extradition order Sept. 6. It was approved by California Gov.
George Deukmejian 15 days later. He was released to Massachusetts
authorities last week.
   Bembury's attorney, Vivian Gray, said she will consider filing
papers challenging the legality of the extradition warrant.

<HEAD>City Wares For Sale: Ballot Boxes, Parking Meters, Manhole Covers</HEAD>

   For 21 years, the ballot boxes here were
controlled by Mayor Richard J. Daley. Now the city is selling them
_ for $75 each.
   Traffic lights, street signs and even parking meters are being
sold, along with the wooden boxes that held the votes which kept
late mayor and his Democratic machine in office.
   They're all prized wares at The City of Chicago Store, a place
where a buyer can tote home a manhole cover and turn it into a
coffee table.
   ``We started talking about this during the city's
sesquicentennial last year,'' said Lorraine Nadis, who proposed the
idea to the Chicago Tourism Council and the city's Department of
Cultural Affairs.
   ``Other cities have stores,'' she said. ``There's the San
Francisco bridge store. New York has a store and St. Louis has one,
too.
   ``Here, we'll try to have something from every city department
and every museum around. We have art from all over. It's not common
to find any of this stuff.''
   Ms. Nadis was talking and tending the counter at the same time.
The city-owned store, across the street from the Bismarck Hotel and
half a block from City Hall, had been open for a week but afternoon
business was undeniably slow Tuesday.
   No takers yet for $100 manhole covers, crusted with genuine
Chicago grime.
   Ballot boxes, gouged from years of being bounced from ward to
ward or tucked in a precinct captain's truck, have a small plastic
window to imagine the paper ballots once inside.
   ``An end table if someone wants to put glass on top of it,'' Ms.
Nadis suggested. ``Or as a collector's item; there's not too many
of these left.
   ``They all want to know if there are any ballots inside,'' she
added. ``I've only opened one. People are absolutely enthralled
with them.''
   The store also features banners that have waved from city light
posts to honor a symphony conductor, a presidential yacht, music
festivals and visits by foreign leaders.
   Book shelves hold Chicago's very own, such as Nelson Algren's
``Chicago, City On The Make,'' a book of love-hate prose for his
hometown, and analytical works on how Harold Washington, the city's
first black mayor, busted the Democratic machine and rose to power.
   There are pictures and pins, mugs and men's ties. Even city
rodents get their due. A city sanitation poster titled ``Public
Enemy'' has a rat crossed with a red line.
   Unfortunately, Ms. Nadis said, the store won't be able to get
every piece of city history.
   ``We wanted to get the aldermen's old chairs,'' she said,
referring to recent renovations in the City Council. ``But of
course the aldermen get first shot at things like that.''

   One year after ``Black Monday,'' the day of the
world-wide stock market crash, share prices today rebounded
moderately on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the dollar fell against
the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 126.76-point loser
Tuesday, regained 151.69 points, or 0.56 percent, finishing at
27,293.67. The index gained 81.18 points shortly after the market
opened and kept rising.
   ``Buying increased mainly toward the end of the afternoon
session,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage house.
   ``Although trading was not very active, participants traded a
variety of issues, which we consider was a good sign,'' he said,
speaking anonymously. He added that Emperor Hirohito's worsening
condition has held down trading. Volume traded on the first section
was estimated at 550 million shares.
   Hirohito, 87, has been bedridden for a month.
   But the analyst said the market was not effected by the
anniversary of ``Black Monday,'' which led the Tokyo market to
plunge 3,836.48 points when it opened the next day.
   Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, referring
to the anniversary, noted Tuesday that the crash made Japan realize
``its responsibility in the world economy that it had not been
aware of,'' news reports said.
   Miyazawa told reporters after a Cabinet meeting that following
the crash, he ``felt strongly that if the Tokyo stock market was
not reliable, the world economy would face serious consequences.''
   Among issues attracting attention today were Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp. The government will sell 1.5 million NTT shares
Thursday and Friday at about $15,000 per share, a 3.5 percent
discount from today's closing price of about $15,600.
   It will be the third government sale of NTT stock since the
company was privatized in 1985.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 126.85 yen,
down 0.85 yen from Tuesday. Opening at 127.15 yen, it moved lower
and ranged between 126.85 and 127.60 yen.
   Today's closing rate was the lowest since Jun. 21, when the
dollar ended trading at 126.33.
   ``There was no market-affecting news to lead the trading in a
certain direction,'' said Takamasa Yamasaki of Daiwa Bank.
   Investors were uncertain whether to sell or buy the dollar at
the current level, but a few more sold than bought because of less
concern about the U.S. economic growth, he said.
   ``There was no hint of intervention by the Bank of Japan today,
but I believe it won't intervene until the dollar hits the 125-yen
level,'' Yamasaki said.

   Emperor Hirohito's condition worsened today as he
coughed up blood for the first time since his health suddenly
declined exactly one month ago.
   The emperor's daughter, Atsuko Ikeda, said Hirohito was awake
but hardly responded to her when she visited him today, news
reports said.
   Mrs. Ikeda told reporters her father coughed repeatedly during
the five-minute visit to his bedside in the Imperial Palace, Kyodo
News Service said.
   Imperial Household Agency officials said the 87-year-old emperor
was resting and his condition had stabiized.
   The officials said Hirohito coughed up a small amount of blood
around midnight Tuesday, and later discharged more blood from his
bowels. In response, doctors gave him a 0.42-pint blood
transfusion, they said.
   In the past month, he has received 20.2 pints in transfusions,
more than twice the normal amount circulating in his body.
   Imperial officials have declined to confirm or deny news reports
that Hirohito has cancer in the area of his upper intestine.
   Court physicians have unsuccessfully tried to combat Hirohito's
anemia and hemorrhaging with blood transfusions. In recent days
they have allowed the world's oldest living monarch to eat a few
spoonfuls of weak porridge, and acknowledged he is losing strength
because his intravenous feedings cannot supply enough nutrients.

<TEXT>
   The prosecution rested in the 17-month-old
molestation trial of two preschool staff members but a defense bid
to compel the testimony of a boy whose allegations initiated the
investigation in 1984 was stalemated.
   At one point Tuesday, Superior Court Judge William Pounders had
threatened to have the 7-year-old boy's father arrested, but
relented after conferring with him privately.
   The judge gave him until next Tuesday to decide whether he will
voluntarily bring his son to Pounders' chambers.
   The judge, who has been told the child doesn't want to testify,
said he must hear the refusal from the boy before he rules on the
matter.
   Since the boy's allegations were raised against McMartin
Pre-school staff members five years ago, his mother has died of
alcohol-related liver disease and brother has died of brain cancer.
   Attorneys said the father told the judge any discussion of the
case brings back memories of the deaths of the boy's mother and
brother.
   The conflict over the testimony arose on the day prosecutors
rested their case against Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, 61, who are on trial on 65 molestation and
conspiracy charges.
   Prosecutors have based their case on the testimony of 11 child
witnesses who told the jury they were subjected to sexual abuse
while attending the Manhattan Beach school, which was shut down in
1984.
   Defense lawyers were scheduled to begin presenting testimony
today but declined to disclose their first witness.
   Defense attorney Danny Davis told reporters he wanted the boy to
testify because: ``The reports we've gotten is that in June 1984,
the child reported he was being continuously molested by someone
who was not Raymond Buckey. And Raymond Buckey had been continually
in jail for three months at that time.''
   Prosecutors declined to comment on that statement but said if
the child were capable of testifying they would have called him as
a witness.

<HEAD>Party Members Arrested As Central Committee Meets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissenting members of Afghanistan's
dominant, Soviet-style party were arrested prior to a meeting of
the party's leadership, an official source said today.
   Other Afghan sources said the Central Committee of the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan began its session this morning,
although no official announcement was made.
   The session follows reports of disagreements among party leaders
as the Afghan government seeks to reach a settlement with Moslem
guerrillas who have been fighting Afghan and Soviet forces for
nearly a decade.
   President Najib, the party's general secretary, and senior
government officials have spoken repeatedly of broadening the base
of the government in hopes of ending the war.
   The arrests of an undisclosed number of party members was
announced Tuesday night on government television. The broadcast
provided no further details.
   The official source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the arrests were ``due to some opposition activity that they were
launching against the policy of national reconciliation.''
   National reconciliation is the term given to efforts to
negotiate an end to the war with the guerrillas.
   These efforts have accelerated with the withdrawal of Soviet
troops, scheduled to be completed Feb. 15. But the guerrillas, who
are supported by Pakistan and the United States, have refused to
negotiate with any government headed by Najib.
   The official source said he did not know whether those arrested
belonged to the 140-member Central Committee. He said most of the
arrests were made in Kabul, where committee members have converged
the past week and were thought to be meeting in separate groups
before joining for a full meeting.
   He said he did not know the number of arrests, but deduced
``from the way it was announced'' that it was more than three.
   Najib has already made several shows of broadening his
government, but these efforts have failed to bring the Mujahedeen
to negotiations.
   Najib in May named a new prime minister, Mohammad Hasan Sharq,
who is not a party member but has had close ties with the Kremlin.
   Although the party is officially portrayed as unified, it has
two wings _ the more hawkish Khalq and Parcham _ that have had a
history of periodically violent rivalry since the party's founding
in 1965.
   Najib belongs to the Parcham faction and took power in 1986.
   The party first achieved power in 1978 when Noor Mohammad Taraki
ousted the government of Mohammad Daoud, who had overthrown King
Zahir Shah in 1973.
   Taraki was ousted by another coup in 1979 and replaced by
Hafizullah Amin, who was deposed three months later when the
Soviets entered Afghanistan. Amin was succeeded by Babrak Karmal,
who was moved aside by Najib.
   Under an accord signed April 14 in Geneva, the Soviet Union
began withdrawing troops May 15. An estimated 50,000 to 60,000
remain.

<HEAD>Arson Suspected In Second Fire At Black Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK FORK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black congregation whose 125-year-old
church was destroyed by arson in April has been hit by a suspicious
blaze that left only a wall standing two weeks before the
dedication of the reconstructed building.
   ``You try not to get discouraged,'' said Wesley Matlock, whose
great-grandparents founded The New Bethel African Methodist
Episcopal Church of Rock Fork. ``We want to have a church, but this
hurts a lot.''
   The cause of the early morning blaze has not been determined,
but Lt. Dennis Fischer, chief of detectives for the Madison County
sheriff's department said it was being investigated as arson.
   ``We have invitations to the church reopening sitting in boxes,
and we were waiting to put them in the mail,'' said Donna Jackson,
wife of the pastor, the Rev. Steven Jackson.
   ``We even had hats made for the construction workers saying, `I
helped rebuild Rock Fork.' It's so sad,'' she said. ``Nobody really
knows what to do. We're just in such a state of shock.''
   The small church, whose 25 members are black, has been sitting
on an isolated site in this southern Illinois community since 1863.
But in recent years, it has been the target of a bombing and
vandalism. Last year, it was defaced with racial epithets.
   The neighborhood around the church is predominantly white, but
church members say they know of no organized group causing the
damage. They said they have not received any threats.
   Each time, church members joined with volunteers from nearby
Alton and Godfrey, north of St. Louis, to clean up the damage. This
time, they aren't sure what to do.
   ``We don't know right now,'' said the pastor.
   Residents reported the blaze early Tuesday and the church was
``pretty well engulfed'' in flames by the time firefighters from
nearby Godfrey arrived, Fischer said. No injuries were reported.
   The fire left only one wall of the church standing _ just two
weeks before it was scheduled to reopen after the April 16 fire
that authorities also said was the work of arsonists. The repair
work had been nearly complete, and the congregation was to
rededicate the church Nov. 6.
   Instead, they gathered Tuesday to inspect more damage. Jackson
estimated the damage at about $50,000. He said the building was
insured.
   No arrests have been made in either fire.
   ``I just think it's a few sick vandals, young adults,'' Matlock
said.
   Virginia DeBruce, another church member, said, ``We've been here
for years, and all of this just started lately. I guess it's just
the world changing.''

<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization's
parliament in exile, the Palestine National Council, will meet in
Algiers during the first 10 days of November, a PLO official said
on national television.
   The meeting has been planned for months to discuss the situation
in the occupied territories where Palestinians have been in revolt
since December 1987. News reports have said the council is expected
to formally create a Palestinian state and a government in exile
during the meeting.
   Interviewed by Algerian television Tuesday night, Moundher
Dajani said the council meeting would be held ``between Oct. 31 and
Nov. 10, taking into consideration the fact that a referendum will
be held in Algeria on Nov. 3.''
   Algerians will be voting that day on political changes proposed
by President Chadli Bendjedid following street riots earlier this
month.
   ``The declaration of independence will be adopted,'' Moundher
said. ``The Palestinian state will be created despite the
declarations of (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir.''

<HEAD>With PM-India-Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Boeing 737 has been a success as the world's
most popular commercial aircraft, but the workhorse jetliner has
had its share of tragedy since its introduction 20 years ago.
   The latest disaster involving a 737 occurred in India this
morning, when an Indian Airlines 737 crashed on final approach to
Ahmadabad airport about 300 miles southwest of New Delhi, killing
130 of the 135 people aboard, officials said.
   The plane was trying to land in heavy fog, but the cause of the
crash was not known, said G.K. Rawal, police inspector at the
airport.
   A Boeing Commercial Airplanes investigator headed to the crash
scene from Bombay, company spokesman Tom Cole said here.
   On Monday, National Transportation and Safety Board officials
revealed that a foot-long crack had been discovered on a
Continental Airlines 737 as it was stripped for repainting Oct. 5.
   The aircraft came under increased scrutiny after April 28, when
part of the fuselage of an Aloha Airlines 737 peeled off at 24,000
feet over Hawaii. A flight attendant was swept to her death and 61
passengers were hurt, but the pilot managed to land the plane
safely.
   That accident triggered inspections of older 737s, and increased
pressure to update U.S. commercial jets.
   A little more than a month ago, on Sept. 16, a 737 crashed and
burst into flames after running into a flock of birds in northwest
Ethiopia. Thirty-one people were killed.
   On Aug. 31, 1987, a Thai Airways 737 fell into the sea off the
southern island of Phuket, killing all 83 people aboard.
   One of the best-known air disasters involving the aircraft
occurred in January 1982, when an Air Florida 737 crashed into a
bridge after taking off from National Airport in Washington, D.C.,
killing 78 people.
   In August 1981, a Far Eastern Air Transport 737 exploded 22,000
feet over Taiwan, killing all 110 people aboard.
   The 737 entered service in 1968, and is the world's most popular
commercial aircraft with more than 2,000 ordered in five different
models.
   The Indian Airlines plane was the 271st off the Boeing assembly
line and company records indicate it was delivered in December
1970, Cole said.
   The plane in the Aloha accident was No. 152, the Far Eastern Air
Transport was No. 151 and the Continental plane was No. 170. All
three were built in 1969.
   Indian Airlines, the domestic carrier, has come under criticism
recently for its poor management and maintenance record and
frequent delays. Today's crash was the 16th by an Indian Airlines
carrier during the past 25 years.
   An Indian Airlines 737 carrying 123 passengers crash-landed on
its belly June 19 after its landing gear failed, and an engine
caught fire as it slid along the runway, but no one was injured.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino today
dismissed criticism of the new U.S. bases agreement and the largest
political party in Congress pledged to support the controversial
accord.
   The agreement, signed Monday in Washington by Secretary of State
George Shultz and Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus,
allows the United States to maintain six bases here until 1991 in
return for $962 million in aid over the final two years of the pact.
   But critics charged that the government settled for too little
compensation. Filipino negotiators had demanded $1.2 billion
annually.
   ``I knew that it would not get total acceptance,'' Mrs. Aquino
said of the agreement. ``But I still believe Secretary Manglapus
did a very commendable job and that certainly, it is a big
improvement from the previous bases agreement.''
   About 150 members of the leftist May First Movement shouted
anti-American slogans and burned a U.S. flag near the U.S. Embassy
today to protest the agreement. Riot police prevented them from
marching to the embassy grounds and they dispersed without violence.
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said the agreement showed that
Mrs. Aquino had secretly decided to work for extending the bases
even after their lease expires in September 1991.
   ``The terms contained in the just-concluded agreement strongly
indicate to us that the Aquino regime will continue to foist upon
our people this onerous burden of a military presence on Philippine
soil,'' he said.
   The United States had been paying $180 million a year for use of
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations.
   Despite the increase, there has been strong criticism of the
agreement because the government raised public expectations that it
would hold out for $1.2 billion a year as well as other concessions
that Manglapus failed to win.
   The pro-Aquino ``Struggle of the Democratic Filipino'' party
said today that the agreement provided nearly three times as much
aid as the United States granted to now-ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   ``Our party is satisfied with the agreement and will support it,
although we realize that more hard work is needed to resolve other
issues related to the American base facilities in our country,'' it
said.
   The party claims membership of 145 of the 202 House members and
six of the 23 senators.
   On Tuesday, the Senate debated whether Monday's agreement
required its approval in accordance with a constitutional provision
on international agreements, but was unable to resolve the issue
and postponed discussion to a later date.
   Mrs. Aquino said today she would discuss the ratification issue
with lawmakers but ``my legal advisers tell me that there is no
need for that.''
   Critics said the accord could prompt even stronger opposition to
the bases and raise doubts over whether the Philippines would
extend the lease on the facilities, which expires in September 1991.
   Under the Constitution, any extension must be approved by
two-thirds of the Senate, where anti-bases sentiment is strong.
   The agreement allows the United States to maintain its policy of
neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on
aircraft and ships visiting the bases.
   The constitution mandates that the Philippines adopt a policy of
freedom from nuclear weapons ``consistent with the national
interest.'' Legal experts say the phrase falls short of an outright
ban.
   Communist guerrillas, whose demand for the removal of the bases
has fanned a 20-year-old rebellion, accused the goverment of
``shamelessly selling out'' Philippine sovereignty.

<TEXT>
   Two police officers, one of them working
undercover in an alleged crack den, were killed within hours of
each other in separate shootings in upper Manhattan, authorities
said.
   Police arrested two suspects, including at least one of the
alleged gunmen, in what Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said was
the first case he knew of two police officers being killed in one
night in different incidents.
   Undercover Officer Christopher Hoban, 26, of Brooklyn, was shot
early Tuesday night during a drug raid when one of three cocaine
dealers guessed that he and his partner were policemen, Ward said.
One of the alleged dealers was also killed.
   Less than three hours later, Officer Michael J. Buczek, 24, of
Suffern was killed when he and his partner responded to a routine
medical emergency call in Harlem and ended up chasing two
``suspicious'' men, Ward said.
   The deaths raise to seven the number of officers killed on duty
this year.
   After each of Tuesday's killings, Ward and Mayor Edward I. Koch
met with the officers' families, then relayed the grim facts of
each case at hospital news conferences.
   ``It's an enormous tragedy. ... It's really overwhelming,'' Koch
said.
   Hoban, a four-year veteran, was shot twice as he and his
partner, Officer Michael Jermyn, 25, prepared to buy a gram of
cocaine prior to a raid at what residents said was a crack den. One
of three drug dealers believed the undercover policemen were
officers and one dealer began firing a .357-caliber Magnum,
striking Hoban in the chest and head, the commissioner said.
   A dealer, Manuel DeLarosa, 23, of Puerto Rico, was killed by the
officers during the struggle. The second suspect, Flavio Prophete,
49, was caught fleeing the building and the third suspect was being
sought, Ward said.
   The second shooting occurred as Buczek and his partner prepared
to leave a building and noticed two men ``acting suspicious'' in
the lobby, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   The officers asked them to stop, Ward said, but they fled. The
officers pursued them less than a block before each officer caught
up with one suspect, Ward said.
   However, one of the suspects spun around and killed Buczek with
two blasts to the chest and abdomen from a semiautomatic weapon,
Ward said.
   The second man apparently escaped in the commotion as the
surviving officer fired four shots.
   Alice McGillion, a police spokeswoman, said the suspected gunman
``made a comment as he was going down the block that he had just
shot a cop.'' With the help of descriptions from residents who
heard the comment, police apprehended the man almost immediately,
she said.
   His identity was being withheld early today pending arraignment,
O'Donnell said.

   A burglar fell into a baptismal pool
before making off with about $7,000 in church equipment, authorites
said.
   The burglar apparently fell into the Danville Church of Christ's
baptismal pool while crossing the altar on his way to the locked
room where the equipment was kept, the Hendricks County sheriff's
department said.
   The white cloth he used to dry himself and a blue and yellow
baseball cap were the only clues the intruder left behind Saturday,
Sheriff's Lt. John Hancock said.
   Missing was an IBM computer, a copy machine and computer

   Foul-mouthed students will be punished for
unsavory utterances or offending epithets scrawled on lockers under
a policy designed to stifle an outbreak of schoolyard name-calling.
   The measure, proposed by board member Jackie Goldberg, requires
schools to develop discipline plans for those who utter slurs
against any person on the basis of race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, disabilities, immigration status or political belief.
   A companion measure also approved unanimously Monday by the
Board of Education requires each school to decide how to discipline
students for acts of physical violence that stem from hatred or
bigotry.
   Ms. Goldberg said she hopes the measures will help reverse a
noticeable increase in the use of slurs on playgrounds and locker
graffiti. She attributed the increase to a lapse in sensitivity
since the 1960s.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Stipe Suvar
proposed today that one-third of the party's powerful Central
Committee be replaced over the next six weeks, the state news
agency Tanjug reported.
   He also asked for a secret vote of confidence in members of the
ruling party Politburo by the Central Committee.
   Four Politburo members whose resignations had already been
announced were relieved of their seats on that body today. They are
two former party heads, Bosko Krunic and Milanko Renovica; Kolj
Siroka, an ethnic Albanian leader from Kosovo; and Franc Setinc, a
Communist leader from liberal northern Slovenia.
   Suvar made the proposals after two days of bitter debate among
the nation's leaders at a special conference called to deal with
the nation's worst economic and ethnic crisis since World War II.
   The Central Committee shake-up would be the largest single sweep
through the ruling elite since 1948, when Stalinists were purged
after Josip Broz Tito broke with Moscow.
   ``No purge is involved,'' Suvar stressed, accordig to Tanjug.
   He said the replacements should be carried out by secret ballot,
with several candidates for each seat.
   He said a list of candidates would be prepared over the next
month and voting would then start. The Central Committee should
have 165 members, but currently has 162 because of the death of one
member and the resignation of two others.
   Suvar also named Azem Vlasi, an influential ethnic Albanian
leader from the autonomous province of Kosovo, and Svetislav
Dolasevic, a Slav from the same province, as Central Committee
members whose continued membership would have to be decided. He did
not say when.
   Vlasi's ouster has been demanded by hundreds of thousands of
Serbs rallying in recent weeks to press for more Serbian control
over Kosovo, an ancient Serbian heartland now dominated by an
ethnic Albanian majority.
   Ten members of the 23-man presidium, or ruling party Politburo,
including Suvar, face the vote of confidence by the Central
Committee.
   ``We are doing this out of responsibility to the Central
Committee, the party membership and the broader public,'' Suvar
said.
   The vote does not include the four presidium members whose
resignations were accepted.
   Nine members of the presidium who hold their seats as party
chiefs of Yugoslavia's six republics, two autonomous provinces and
the armed forces are exempt from the confidence vote.
   They include Slobodan Milosevic, the party leader of
Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia.
   The call for the massive personnel change and the vote came amid
signs of dissatisfaction with the pace of the meeting.
   A state newspaper said today that 200,000 Serbs may abandon a
troubled province en masse this week unless progress was made at
the meeting.
   Early editions of the official Yugoslav daily Borba said many of
the 200,000 Serbs in the Kosovo province were dissatisfied with the
``fruitless and marathon discussions'' at the party's Central
Committee session and were planning a rally for Thursday.
   During the rally, to be held in a suburb of the provincial
capital of Pristina, Kosovo Serbs are to decide whether to leave
the area and head to Serbia, a republic to the north, Borba said.
   Serbian activists want Serbia to have more control over Kosovo
and Vojvodina, two autonomous provinces which are part of it but
not fully subject to its control.
   Serbs allege harassment by the ethnic Albanian majority in
Kosovo.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces. Serbia is the largest republic.
   The decentralized system of government and collective federal
presidency were devised in former President Josip Broz Tito's 1974
constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway, but has
resulted in an ineffective government by compromise.
   The ethnic clashes in Kosovo have led to broader, more
widespread public protests over Yugoslavia's teetering economy.
   Non-Serb leaders fear Milosevic is using the rallies and his
campaign for more Serbian control over Vojvodina and Kosovo to
increase his own power and that of the Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest
ethnic group.
   His drive has brought him into open conflict with Suvar and with
Milan Kucan, the head of the Communist party in the liberal
northern republic of Slovenia. The three are Yugoslavia's most
important leaders.
   Meanwhile, a judge in Titograd, the capital of the southern
republic of Montenegro, sentenced a 23-year-old man to 60 days in
jail for denouncing state leaders at an anti-government protest,
the official Tanjug news agency reported Tuesday.
   The man, identified as Vukman Cejovic, was shown on national
television at the time declaring that Yugoslavia ``is run by
Fascists.''

<HEAD>Cabinet Head Denies Blocking Solution To Constitutional Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army Gen. Michel Aoun, head of the
Christian military cabinet in a dual government, has denied Moslem
charges that he is blocking a solution to Lebanon's month-old
constitutional crisis.
   Aoun also called during an interview for Lebanon to regain its
sovereignty, which he said had been lost to Syria. Syria is ruling
Lebanon ``in a detailed way that includes day-to-day affairs,'' he
said.
   Aoun's rival, acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem,
and outgoing Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem,
charged that Aoun is an obstacle to electing a new president.
   Parliament's failure to elect a head of state or new speaker is
threatening to split the country into sectarian states after 13
years of civil war.
   ``I am not an obstacle, I am a shield that prevents the
appointment of a president. A president for Lebanon should be
elected, not appointed,'' Aoun said Tuesday in Baabda, northeast of
Beirut.
   The 52-year-old commander, who in 1966 attended an advanced
artillery course at Fort Sill, Okla., said his military cabinet
will continue to rule ``until a new president is elected.''
   ``We shall preserve Lebanon's unity,'' he said.
   Former President Amin Gemayel, shortly before his six-year term
expired on Sept. 22, appointed Aoun to head a six-man interim
military cabinet to rule pending election of a new head of state.
   Aoun's appointment was immediately rejected by Moslem and
leftist parliamentarians representing Syrian-policed provinces.
They pledged allegiance to Hoss, the head of government during
Gemayel's term.
   The appointment also violated an unwritten national covenant
dating to Lebanon's independence from France in 1943 that gave the
premiership to the Sunnis, the presidency to the Maronite
Christians and the post of house speaker to the Shiites.
   The 76-man Parliament has failed three times since Aug. 18 to
elect a president due to a boycott by 27 Christian deputies that
prevented the single-chamber house from mustering the 51-member
quorum to convene.
   The Christians say they boycotted Parliament to block the
election of a pro-Syrian president who would make Lebanon a
satellite for its neighbor.
   Parliament on Tuesday also failed to convene and elect a
successor to Speaker Husseini.
   Aoun blamed ``outside powers'' for the failure to vote in a new
president and partitioning his cabinet.
   ``The Syrians rule the streets, the police stations and the
governors in the hope of dominating the head of state,'' he said.
   ``We should regain our sovereignty from the Syrian brethren
because they have been directly ruling Lebanon. There won't be a
sound relationship between Lebanon and Syria unless Syrian troops
withdraw from Lebanon.''
   The Syrian government of President Hafez Assad is the principal
power in Lebanon with 40,000 troops deployed in about 70 percent of
the nation.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, said he had no new information on the
14 foreign hostages being held mainly by pro-Iranian factions in
Lebanon.
   ``I do not have updated information at present because they (the
kidnappers) keep moving the hostages,'' he said.
   The foreign hostages include nine Americans, three Britons, one
Irishman and one Italian. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, abducted March 16, 1985, is
the longest-held hostage.

<HEAD>Groups Seek Environmental Assessment Of Restarting SRP Reactors</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP ) _ Three environmental groups have called on
Energy Secretary John Herrington to prepare an environmental impact
statement before restarting any of the troubled Savannah River
Plant reactors.
   If the Department of Energy refuses, the groups will seek a
court injunction to stop the three aging reactors from operating
until the comprehensive study is completed, Dan Reicher, an
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Tuesday.
   The NRDC, Greenpeace U.S.A. and South Carolina's Energy Research
Foundation planned to deliver a letter to Herrington today,
requesting the environmental impact statement.
   Meanwhile, a published report said Tuesday that poorly trained
personnel and inadequate safety procedures were blamed for a leak
of 375,000 gallons of water contaminated by radiation at the
38-year-old plant.
   Officials with the Du Pont Co., which operates the nuclear
weapons facility for the Department of Energy, also said an
oversight caused underreporting of the amount of radioactive
contaminant in the water released into a creek on July 8, The
Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle and the Augusta Herald reported.
   The amount of radiation spilled into the water was too small to
pose a health or safety threat, officials said.
   SRP's three reactors were reduced to half power last year when
experts questioned whether the emergency cooling system could
handle a problem at full power.
   Since April, all three reactors have been shut down entirely for
maintenance and testing amid additional safety questions. One
reactor was restarted for less than a week in August.
   When it was shut down, SRP was the government's sole producer of
radioactive tritium and plutonium used in nuclear weapons.
   An environmental impact statement is required under federal law
whenever there is a ``major federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment.''
   Reicher said restart of the reactors qualifies as a ``major
federal action'' because ``revelations about the SRP reactors ...
raise disturbing questions about the environmental and safety risks
of their future operation.''
   Department of Energy Deputy Secretary Joseph Salgado said Oct.
10 that a ``phased restart'' of SRP's K Reactor is planned in
December and restart the two other reactors will be restarted by
the middle of 1989.
   Herrington said last week that the department will operate
reactors in a safe and ``environmentally sensitive manner'' while
still meeting the nation's defense needs.

<HEAD>Settlement Proposed In Ford Trust Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of Henry Ford II will
receive $10.5 million a year for life under a proposed settlement
intended to end the family's legal squabble over the auto magnate's
$350 million trust.
   Attorneys for Ford's third wife, Kathleen Duross Ford, are
expected to petition Palm Beach Circuit Judge Vaughn Rudnick today
for approval of the plan, which would give Mrs. Ford seven times
the minimum annual payment bequeathed by her husband.
   In addition, the settlement would grant Mrs. Ford, 48, ownership
of the couple's homes in Palm Beach, Grosse Pointe, Mich., and
London, and rights to purchase three additional Ford residences.
   ``I hope this puts an end to the litigation, but we'll just have
to see what happens,'' said Robert Montgomery, Mrs. Ford's attorney.
   ``The real benefit is that now the trust can get on with the
administration and not be bogged down in the sniping,'' said
attorney Arthur England, also representing Mrs. Ford.
   Meanwhile, a guardian representing the financial interests of
minor and unborn heirs to Ford's estate said they are protected in
the proposed settlement.
   Retired Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Robert Hewitt, appointed
to represent four minor grandchildren, unborn grandchildren and any
offspring, recommended Rudnick approve the settlement.
   In some versions of the Ford story transmitted Tuesday, The
Associated Press inadvertently reported an outdated development
that had once threatened the settlement.
   Rudnick's ruling on the proposed settlement was delayed Sept. 26
when an attorney representing the grandchildren suggested
appointment of a form of guardian. Attorneys at the time had argued
over calling in such a guardian, but all attorneys involved were
pleased at Hewitt's recommendation, the Fort Lauderdale News and
Sun-Sentinel reported Tuesday.
   Rudnick's ruling, expected in the next few days, should settle
the widow's lawsuit challenging the administration of the trust.
   She and Edsel Ford II, Henry Ford's son by a previous marriage,
had disagreed over how the money should be invested, which attorney
would be counsel for the trust and whether the trust should pay
family friend William Donaldson $1 million a year to manage the
money as a third trustee.
   Specific terms of the settlement agreement have not been
disclosed, but Mrs. Ford's attorneys said she withdrew her
objection to Donaldson. His payments under the settlement haven't
been disclosed.
   Mrs. Ford is entitled to receive a minimum of $1.5 million a
year from the trust.
   Ford died at age 70 in September 1987. The family had hoped to
avoid public airing of their dispute, but it erupted when Mrs. Ford
objected to the selection of Donaldson, a former undersecretary of
state.

<TEXT>
   The parents of 53 children allegedly
abused by members of a religious group remain loyal to the
organization's founder, whose 8-year-old daughter died from a
beating last week, social workers said.
   A spokeswoman for the Oregon Children's Services Division said
Tuesday that the parents have displayed ``no lack of confidence''
in Eldridge Broussard Jr., the founder of the Los Angeles-based
Ecclesia Athletic Foundation.
   ``They trust him implicitly,'' said spokeswoman Alice Galloway.
   Broussard and the children's parents abruptly canceled
interviews with agency caseworkers Tuesday, Galloway said.
   The children, who are in the agency's custody, have yet to visit
with their parents. Each family has been assigned a caseworker, who
will determine whether each child can safely return home.
   Galloway said the children were recovering quickly from what
authorities allege was a terrifying experience at the hands of the
religious group.
   The Clackamas County Juvenile Department has charged that the
children routinely were beaten with a paddle or electrical cord.
Some children were beaten up to 800 times while others were forced
to keep count, the department said in a court petition.
   The children had scars consistent with extended beatings, and
they were mentally scarred as well, authorities said.
   When they first arrived at state institutions and foster homes
Saturday the children were very quiet, but by Tuesday they were
talking and even arguing, which Galloway called a healthy sign.
   The children were ``eating like horses and the staff is watching
what they're eating so they don't get sick,'' said Galloway.
   The 53 children were taken into state custody after the beating
death of Dayna Lorea Broussard on Friday. Four men associated with
Broussard have been charged with manslaughter and are in custody.
   Two other children are in the custody of Los Angeles Police
Department's Children's Protective Division, said Capt. Patrick
Detloff of the Clackamas County sheriff's department.
   All 55 children, ranging in age from 1{ months to 16 years, are
believed to have been in a farmhouse east of Portland where the
Broussard girl allegedly was killed, said Clackamas County
sheriff's spokeswoman Judy Gage.
   The girl's body showed ``a lot of whip marks'' on her head,
arms, legs and trunk, said state medical examiner Dr. Larry V.
Lewman. He said an autopsy showed she died from head injuries, and
also revealed old as well as recent injuries.
   Gage said detectives met Tuesday with Broussard at his request,
but that she didn't know the subject of the meeting.
   Broussard founded the Ecclesia Athletic Association in 1975 and
loosely based the organization at the Watts Christian Center in Los
Angeles.
   Carolyn Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for Broussard, said Ecclesia no
longer exists in name but continues in spirit and concept. She said
the group sometimes uses ``physical correction'' as a form of
discipline, but denied the punishment was cruel.

   Three anti-apartheid leaders
who escaped to the U.S. Consulate 36 days ago emerged from their
refuge today to test the government's claim that they are free men.
   The activists said Nelson Mandela, serving a life prison term
for his anti-apartheid activities, advised them to leave the
consulate. They pledged to resume anti-apartheid work.
   The government says it will not detain the men again. They had
been jailed without charge more a year when they slipped away from
police guards and fled to the consulate Sept. 13.
   The three _ Murphy Morobe and Mohanned Valli Moosa, leaders of
the United Democratic Front coalition, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman
of the National Education Crisis Committee _ had been living in a
consular meeting room on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office
building.
   The men grinned broadly as they embraced their families and
colleagues waiting in the lobby of the building. They gave
clenched-fist salutes to cheering supporters, mostly young blacks,
who chanted ``Viva!'' and ``Amandla!'' which means ``power'' in
Zulu language.
   Riot police with truncheons and shotguns were deployed. Officers
sought to keep the crowd under control and police camera crews
filmed the event.
   ``It's great to be out of here,'' said Khanyile.
   ``It is not without apprehension that we have left the
consulate,'' Valli Moosa said at a news conference later.
``Notwithstanding the government's assurances, we realize that we
could be redetained or given harsh banning orders.''
   Valli Moosa said the three were influenced by advice from
Mandela, a black leader who is recuperating from tuberculosis at a
Cape Town clinic.
   ``The view of comrade Nelson Mandela was that we should leave
the consulate as soon as possible, and that assisted us in our
decision to leave,'' Valli Moosa said. He said the advice was
passed to the three by Mandela's wife, Winnie.
   The United Democratic Front is the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition. The crisis committee, a front affiliate,
was formed to seek greater black control over education policies.
Both groups were banned in February, along with scores of other
organizations opposed to apartheid.
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in July 1987
after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June
12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in December 1986.
   The activists said they had cordial relations with the U.S.
Consulate staff but were never offered a meeting with U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins.
   ``We would like to interpret it as a snub... but there may have
been other reasons,'' said Morobe. He said the three did not
request a meeting with Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador in
South Africa.
   U.S. officials said they would not force the three to leave
despite a U.S. policy of not allowing diplomatic offices to be used
by those seeking asylum.
   About 30,000 people have been detained without trial for varying
lengths of time under the 28-month-old state of emergency. About
1,000 people currently are believed to be in detention. Most are
being held for political activism.
   An activist who escaped Sept. 21 to the U.S. Consulate, Clifford
Ngcobo, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment. His
lawyers had alleged he was tortured while in custody.
   Between the emergency declaration and his detention, Morobe
operated from underground as chief spokesman for the United
Democratic Front. One of the front's most eloquent speakers and
writers, he played a key role in coveying its positions at a time
when most of its leadership was in jail or in hiding.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   It was unclear whether the government will allow the three
activists to promote their positions freely or whether they will be
restricted in some manner.

   Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber and
Hartmut Michel of West Germany won the Nobel Prize in chemistry
today for determining the structure of certain proteins needed in
photosynthesis.
   In 1982, Michel was able to obtain these proteins in a
crystalline form that allowed their structure to be determined, and
the structure was then determined in collaboration with Deisenhofer
and Huber, said the citation from the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences.
   Deisenhofer, 45, studied at the Max Planck Institute for
Biochemistry and now works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
in Dallas.
   Huber, 51, is still at the Max Planck biochemistry institute in
Martinsried, West Germany. Michel, 42, works at the Max Planck
Institute for Biophysics in Frankfurt.
   The proteins studied by the researchers were taken from bacteria
which, like green plants, draw energy from sunlight. These
so-called membrane-bound proteins are found in the membranes
surrounding structures called chloroplasts and mitochondria inside
cells. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which is essential to
photosynthesis, and mitochondria are the cell's energy-generating
factories.
   The work of Deisenhofer, Huber and Michel has led to increased
understanding of photosynthesis not only in bacteria, but in algae
and higher plants as well, the academy said.
   Earlier in the day, three Americans shared the Nobel Prize in
physics.
   Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger, an American
working in Switzerland, were cited for their work with neutrino
beams. The announcement said their work was carried out in the
1960s and ``opened entirely new opportunities for research into the
innermost structure and dynamics of matter.''

   Three Americans won the Nobel Prize in

subatomic particles called neutrinos to peer ever deeper into the
fundamental structure of matter.
   Three West Germans won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for
determining the structure of proteins that plants and some bacteria
need to convert sunlight to energy through photosynthesis.
   The Royal Academy of Sciences awarded the physics prize to Leon
Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger for their work with

and ``opened entirely new opportunities for research into the
innermost structure and dynamics of matter.''
   The academy also cited their discovery of the muon neutrino.
   Neutrinos are extremely tiny particles _ even on the subatomic
scale _ with no electrical charge. They interact very weakly with
other forms of matter and could easily pass through a layer of lead
trillions of miles thick without being diverted from their course,
according to the Nobel citation.
   ``The contribution now awarded consisted among other things of
transforming the ghostly neutrino into an active tool of
research,'' the announcement said.
   Lederman, who got the call from Stockholm around 6 a.m. EDT,
said:
   ``It's a nice way to be awakened. ... They apologized for waking
me up, but I said that's quite all right, anytime.''
   Asked about the scientists' research, he added: ``This is an
experiment that was completed and published in 1961. Those poor
guys in Stockholm have been puzzling over it ever since and finally
decided it was good stuff.
   ``Some day, some kid who is now in high school will find out how
to use this information to bring benefits to all of society.''
   Lederman, 66, said he hasn't decided whether to use his share of
the $390,000 prize ``to buy a castle in Spain or a string of race
horses.''
   Lederman is director at the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory in Batavia, Ill. Schwartz, 55, is a former professor at
Stanford University and now president of Digital Pathways, Inc., in
Mountain View, Calif.
   Steinberger, 67, was born in Bad Kissingen, West Germany, and is
an American citizen. However, the academy officially lists his
nationality as Swiss. He has been a physicist at CERN, in Geneva,
since 1968.
   The academy cited the laureates' research at Columbia University
in the early 1960s, when they tried to find a way to study the
effect of weak forces at high energies.
   During a coffee break, Lederman, Schwartz and Steinberger, with
other scientists, discussed using beams of ``common'' particles _
electrons, protons and neutrons _ but those beams were judged
unsatisfactory for the purpose.
   Schwartz then proposed using a beam of neutrinos for the
experiment. It took two years to devise an intense beam of
neutrinos free from all other particles and to design a detector to
measure reactions produced by the neutrino beam, the announcement
said.
   Chemistry prizewinners Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber and
Hartmut Michel of West Germany were cited ``for the determination
of the three-dimensional structure of a photosynthetic reaction
center.''
   In 1982, Michel was able to obtain the proteins in a crystalline
form that allowed their structure to be determined. He then
determined their structure in collaboration with Deisenhofer and
Huber.
   Deisenhofer, 45, studied at the Max Planck Institute for
Biochemistry and now works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
in Dallas.
   Huber, 51, is still at the Max Planck biochemistry institute in
Martinsried, West Germany. Michel, 42, works at the Max Planck
Institute for Biophysics in Frankfurt.
   The proteins they studied were taken from bacteria which, like
green plants, draw energy from sunlight. These so-called
membrane-bound proteins are found in the membranes surrounding
structures called chloroplasts and mitochondria inside cells.
Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which is essential to
photosynthesis, and mitochondria are the cell's energy-generating
factories.
   The work of Deisenhofer, Huber and Michel led to increased
understanding of photosynthesis not only in bacteria, but in algae
and higher plants as well, the academy said.
   Today's prizes were the last of six for 1988. Each prize is
worth $390,000.
   On Tuesday, Maurice Allais, whose ideas on balancing supply and
demand helped rebuild the French economy after World War II, won
the Nobel Prize for economics.
   On Monday, American researchers Gertrude B. Elion and George H.
Hitchings shared the medicine award with Sir James W. Black of
Britain for helping develop drugs to treat leukemia, high blood
pressure, AIDS and other diseases.
   U.N. peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize, announced
Sept. 29 in Oslo, Norway, and the award in literature went last
week to Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz, the first Arabic-language
writer to win it.
   Economics is the only one of the six Nobel prizes not stipulated
in the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of
dynamite, who died in 1896.

   The just-divorced wife of billionaire
Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke said today she will wage
a ``long, hard battle'' to win generous support for her infant
daughter.
   ``The battle has just begun, because I have my daughter to
protect,'' said Suzanne Martin Cooke, 32.
   Cooke, 75, was granted a divorce from his third wife last week,
but child support and a financial disposition of the prenuptial
agreement signed by both parties are still at issue.
   Fauquier County, Va., Circuit Court Judge W. Shore Robinson has
scheduled a hearing Dec. 12 to rule on matters pertaining to the
divorce, including paternity of the child. Mrs. Cooke said she
asked for blood tests to determine paternity of 9-month-old
Jacqueline Kent Cooke to put to rest ``the vicious rumors going
around Washington.''
   Cooke's lawyer, Burke McCahill of Leesburg, Va., said today, ``I
can't really offer any comment right now'' when asked for reaction
to Mrs. Cooke's statements. He also would not comment on whether
Cooke had denied paternity of the child, or on whether Cooke has
agreed to submit to blood tests.
   Mrs. Cooke, in a telephone call to The Associated Press, said,
``I want to make sure my daughter is taken care of as well as his
two sons were taken care of, as far as education, housing. ...No
amount of money could ever pay for the damage he's done ... to hurt
his poor, innocent daughter. You can't put a figure on it.''
   ``There is no financial settlement. It's going to be a long,
hard battle ... '' she said. ``His problem is getting bigger and
bigger every day.''
   According to court documents, Cooke had agreed to marry Suzanne
Martin on July 24, 1987, on condition that she terminate a
pregnancy that began in early June.
   After the marriage, she backed down on the promise and the
couple separated about four weeks later, court papers said. Cooke
filed for divorce in October.
   Jacqueline Kent Cooke was born on Jan. 25, 1988, six days before
the Redskins won the National Football League's Super Bowl
championship.
   Under terms of a prenuptial agreeement, Mrs. Cooke would be
entitled to $50,000 a year for three years after the divorce, plus
use of a Watergate apartment for five years and a new Jaguar. In
contesting the divorce, she sought a $15 million lump-sum
settlement, spousal support of $10,000 a month, custody of the baby
and $8,000 a month in child support.
   Cooke is one of the richest men in the country, according to the
current issue of Forbes magazine. He owns the Redskins, the
Chrysler Building in New York, the Los Angeles Daily News, a $44
million horse-racing stable in Lexington, Ky., and a cable
television system.
   His first wife was awarded a $41 million divorce settlement in
1979 _ which made the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest
such settlement _ and his second marriage lasted 10 months.

   Wall Street greeted the first anniversary of the
worst stock panic in history today with cynicism, wariness and the
long-awaited government approval of ``circuit breakers'' designed
to foil another crash.
   ``It is not just another day. Many people are aware of it,''
said Philip C. Puccio, manager of institutional trading at the
Dillon, Read & Co. brokerage.
   ``This whole month, as a matter of fact, people have been very
aware of it,'' Puccio said. ``People have just chosen to get past
this period. Psychologically, it has had a major effect on most
players.''
   Reporters and camera crews crammed the New York Stock Exchange's
visitor gallery high atop the cavernous exchange floor on Wall
Street this morning as three senior exchange officials clanged the
opening bell, greeted by a chorus of boos and cheers from the
throngs of floor traders, market makers and messengers below.
   Outside on the corner, a vendor was selling bumper stickers
reading: ``I Survived the Crash of '87, But I Used to Drive a
Mercedes.''
   ``It's business as unusual,'' said Arthur D. Cashin, a
PaineWebber Group Inc. broker and governor on the floor of the
NYSE, where prices inched to a post-crash high Tuesday and edged up
further this morning. Still, the lack of business has left many
standing around with little to do.
   ``If there's no fire, all you see is guys polishing the
engines,'' Cashin said. ``There's a lot of people not
participating, a lot of people on the sidelines. I would say the
mood is sober, bordering on the sullen.''
   The atmosphere in the heart of the nation's financial center
contrasts sharply with the heart-stopping, stupefying frenzy of a
year ago, when prices tumbled out of control and shattered a
five-year bull market that only a month earlier had shown little
sign of fading.
   The Dow Jones industrial averaged finished that day with a
record 508-point loss to 1,738.74, a decline of 22.6 percent. More
than 600 million shares changed hands, nearly double the previous
record.
   It was a jolt that shook the financial world and threatened to
bleed into the nation's banking system. It raised fears of economic
recession and at least foretold uncertain times ahead.
   Since then, forecasts of recession have receded, while the Dow
average and other key indices have recovered somewhat. Late
Tuesday, a buying burst lifted the Dow average 19.38 points to
2,159.85, its highest post-crash close. In the first half hour of
trading today, the average went up an additional 1.60 to 2,161.45.
   But many Wall Street professionals say the stock market remains
uninspired, despite entreaties by some of the best-known firms
exhorting investors to buy. They blame continuing uncertainty about
the direction of interest rates and the nation's general economic
health.
   ``I think people on Wall Street are more concerned about the
economy,'' said Earl Ellis, a market maker on the NYSE floor. ``If
you could assure people that the economy would be good, this market
would take off.''
   The NYSE, alarmed about post-crash investor apathy and
underlying fear of another crash, joined with other U.S. financial
markets last July in proposing ``circuit breakers'' _ coordinated
trading halts and price limits to avoid another panic.
   Late Tuesday, the eve of the crash anniversary, the Securities
and Exchange Commission approved these proposals, which had been
expected. NYSE officials said the proposals officially become
effective as of the close of trading today.
   Coordination among markets was a key recommendation by a White
House panel appointed to study the crash. But it took months for
the New York exchange and other markets to finally agree on how to
do it.
   ``There's a time to be stubborn and there's a time to be
accommodative and get some stuff done,'' Exchange Chairman John
Phelan told reporters at a briefing earlier this month, when he
talked about the circuit-breaker proposals. ``I think this last
year has been a time to be accommodating.''

<HEAD>Judge Bars Doctors From Telling About Positive AIDS Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLATHE, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge permanently barred a man's doctors
from telling his ex-wife that he had tested positive for the AIDS
virus.
   A lawyer for the man, identified in court documents only as John
Doe, said the ruling Tuesday could have nationwide implications.
   Johnson County District Judge Marion Chipman said in his order
issuing a permanent injunction that the man would be substantially
and irreparably injured by the release of his test results to his
ex-wife by Prime Health, a Kansas City health maintenance
organization.
   Court documents said the man does not have AIDS but has tested
positive for the virus.
   Chipman's opinion noted that the man signed an affidavit saying
he has no intention of engaging in sexual relations with his
ex-wife any more and that the woman has tested negative twice for
AIDS exposure, the second time after her last sexual contact with
the man two years ago. The document did not indicate why the
unidentified woman had decided to have AIDS tests previously.
   Prime Health said it provided health care for both the man and
the woman. The company had said the woman should be advised of the
test results ``even if she has not had sex with him recently, to
alert her to the potential danger she may face.''
   Frank Saunders, a lawyer for Prime Health, said after the ruling
that the health organization would abide by the ruling. Asked about
an appeal, he said, ``I doubt it. They're divorced now. ... The
threat isn't there anymore.''
   David Waxse, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer for the
man, said the ruling could be the first nationwide where a person
has had to get an injunction to prevent his health care provider
from releasing the information that he has tested positive for AIDS.
   ``For other court cases with similar issues, it could have
nationwide implications,'' Waxse said. ``We think (the judge's)
legal reasons may have application to a wide range of cases.''
   Chipman ruled the man's right to privacy would be violated if
Prime Health were allowed to reveal the results to anyone,
including the man's ex-wife.
   ``We are very pleased that Judge Chipman could rationally look
at the issues and decide it based on legal principles involved and
not based on the hysteria often accompanying the AIDS issue,''
Waxse said.

<HEAD>Excerpts From Citation For Nobel In Physics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the citation for
the Nobel Prize in physics and background material from the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences. Leon Lederman, Jack Steinberger and
Melvin Schwartz of the United States won the prize on Wednesday for
their work with neutrino beams.
   The work ... in the 1960s ... led to discoveries that opened
entirely new opportunities for research into the innermost
structure and dynamics of matter. Two great obstacles to further
progress in research into weak forces _ one of nature's four basic
forces _ were removed by the prizewinning work. One of the
obstacles was that there was previously no method for the
experimental study of weak forces at high energies. The other was
theoretically more fundamental, and was overcome by the three
researchers' discovery that there are at least two kinds of
neutrino.
   One belongs with the electron, the other with the muon. The muon
is a relatively heavy, charged elementary particle which was
discovered in cosmic radiation during the 1930s. The view, now
accepted, of the paired grouping of elementary particles has its
roots in the prizewinners' discovery.
   Neutrinos are almost ghostlike constituents of matter. They can
pass unaffected through any wall, in fact all matter is transparent
to them.
   Every human being is penetrated by sun neutrinos at a rate of
several billion per square centimeter per second, day and night,
without leaving any noticeable trace. Neutrinos are inoffensive.
They have no electrical charge and they travel at the speed of
light, or nearly.
   The contribution now awarded consisted among other things of
transforming the ghostly neutrino into an active tool of research.
As well as in cosmic radiation, neutrinos ... can be produced in a
multistep process in particle accelerators, and this is what the
prizewinners utilized.
   The very first experiment using a beam of high-energy neutrinos
originated in one of the daily coffee breaks at (Columbia
University). ... In this stimulating atmosphere around Nobel
prizewinners T.D. Lee, C.N. Yang (Nobel prize for physics 1957) and
others at the end of the 1950s, the need to find a feasible method
of studying the effect of weak forces at high energies was
discussed.
   Hitherto it had only been possible to study processes of
radioactive decay, spontaneous processes at ... low energies. Beams
of all common particles (electrons, protons and neutrons) were
discussed. While these are relatively simple to produce, they were
found to be unusable for this purpose.
   The apparently hopeless situation suddenly changed when ...
Schwartz proposed that it ought to be possible to produce and use a
beam of neutrinos. During the next two years he ... Lederman and
... Steinberger worked on the proposal in order to achieve a
sufficiently intense beam of neutrinos free from all other types of
particle and to design a detector for measuring neutrino reactions.
   To eliminate these unwanted particles completely from the beam,
a 13.5-meter-thick wall of steel was needed. The material came from
scrapped warships. The measuring device ... consisted of a large
number of aluminum plates with spark gaps between them. A muon or
an electron produced by a neutrino in one of the aluminium plates
photographed its own track as a series of sparks, using a special
self-exposing device.
   The prizewinners and their collaborators arranged their detector
so that the cause of the spark tracks could be interpreted. The
results showed that only muons were produced by the neutrinos in
the beam, no electrons.
   Thus there exists a new type of neutrino that forms an intimate
pair with the muon. Consequently the electron forms its own
delimited family with its neutrino.

<TEXT>
   ``What about the 17 points, governor?''
The bad news question dogged Michael Dukakis at a time his
presidential campaign needed a lift.
   The 17 points was the lead Republican George Bush had over
Dukakis in an NBC News-Wall Street Journal national poll released
with barely three weeks left until Election Day.
   Whether that lead was real or a statistical aberration, its
potential impact was critical.
   If Bush was really that far ahead, the race was over. The vice
president could start sending out the invitations to his inaugural
ball and Dukakis could start wondering if wanted to run for another
term as governor of Massachusetts.
   But what if the poll was wrong? Would it be quickly forgotten or
would it foster the impression that another Republican presidential
election victory was inevitable and make it that much harder for
Dukakis to rally his supporters for a closing drive?
   Dukakis aides rushed to refute the NBC poll by pointing to other
surveys saying the Bush lead was more like seven percentage points,
a gap the Democratic nominee had a more realistic chance to
overcome.
   ``This business of polls is really having a terrible effect,''
said Dukakis.
   He said polling ``really drives the process.''
   In this campaign that certainly has been true.
   Ironically, it was the same NBC poll that last July said Dukakis
was 18 points ahead of Bush, the largest margin ever enjoyed by the
Democrat in the battle of poll numbers.
   In the early stages it was all going Dukakis' way.
   Every week through the spring and early summer, a new survey
came out saying the Democrat was eight or nine or 10 or 15 or 17
points ahead of Bush.
   The surveys said up to half of likely voters questioned had a
negative opinion of the vice president.
   Bad news for Bush. He was dead. Candidates with negatives in the
40 to 50 percent range don't win elections.
   Print up the tickets to the Dukakis inaugural ball.
   If that news weren't bad enough, what about the gender gap?
There was something about George Bush that women didn't like. Polls
said the vice president was doing well among white males, but
trailing far behind Dukakis among women.
   Those were the early polls. Now, it's three weeks until the
election and the picture is far different.
   Gone are the Bush negatives. The gender gap still exists but
only in the respect that Bush does better among white males than
among women.
   In the NBC poll, Bush led 64 percent to 30 percent among white
males. Among women he led 48-44 percent, a gap that was within the
margin of error. That still would qualify as a gender gap, but
would hardly offer much consolation to Dukakis.
   At least Dukakis could claim he was consistent in his feelings
about polls. e brushed them off as meaningless when they showed him
way ahead and did the same when they said he was trailing.
   The NBC poll came out late in the day on Monday and was the
latest in a series of blows to the Dukakis campaign effort to
regain momentum.
   A recent ABC state-by-state survey said Bush was leading in
enough states to suggest he could be headed for an electoral
landslide.
   Then last weekend, The Washington Post published a story saying
Dukakis aides had formulated a closing strategy leaning heavily on
18 states with 272 electoral votes, only two more than needed to
win.
   Campaign aides rushed to deny they were adopting such a narrow
plan that would leave no margin for a loss in any target state.
   In the wake of those two polls and the Post story, Dukakis
headed into the industrial Midwest.
   The crowds were good and enthusiastic and the candidate's
rhetoric was sharper than it had been.
   Out on the stump it was easy to set aside bad news.
   ``If you tried to tell these people you can't win Michigan or
Ohio, they'd tell you you had rocks in your head,'' said Charles
Baker, the campaign field director.
   Maybe it was all a mirage and a Massachusetts miracle was going
to occur on Nov. 8.
   And like Dukakis was telling crowds, ``We're going to be the
ones celebrating on Election Night.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is
preparing to order a broader inspection of older Boeing 737
aircraft amid continuing concern about cracking on the aging
jetliners, officials said today.
   The broader inspections, which have been under review for
months, were being speeded up after a series of cracks along a
30-inch section of a Continental Airlines Boeing 737 _ including
one a foot long _ were found by chance two weeks ago.
   It was not clear how many 737s would be subject to the
inspection order.
   The FAA ordered about 200 of the aircraft, those with 30,000 or
more landing and takeoff cycles, to undergo special inspections
last spring after a 20-foot section of an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737
broke off during flight.
   The new order is not related to the crash of an Indian Airlines
Boeing 737 in thick fog early today as it tried to land in
Ahmadabad, India, killing 130 people. Although that plane was an
older Boeing 737, there is no early indication of a structural
problem before the crash, officials said.
   According to the Air Transport Association, there were 570
Boeing 737s in operation by U.S. airlines at the end of l987, but
many of those planes are newer models that likely would not be
subject to the special inspections.
   The Boeing Co. said that 212 of the 737s operated by 19 U.S.
airlines had 30,000 or more cycles and were subject to the FAA
order last spring. Among the airlines that widely use the 737 are
United Airlines, Continental, Delta Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines,
USAir and Southwest Airlines.
   FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said the new inspection order will
require broader use of high-frequency electronic equipment to
better detect cracks and will require the stripping of paint
buildup so cracks can more easily be detected.
   ``We're looking for it (the inspection order) to be issued by
Friday,'' said Buckhorn. The FAA is expected to give carriers time
to conduct the surveillance without grounding aircraft, officials
said.
   Meanwhile, two federal agencies are trying to determine why the
cracks on the Continental Boeing 737 were not discovered earlier.
Continental workers found the cracks, including one about a foot
long, on Oct. 5 after they stripped paint from the plane to prepare
it for repainting.
   The jet, like the one involved in the Aloha incident last April,
was 19 years old and was among the first 291 Boeing 737s that used
a so-called ``cold bonding'' method of attaching sections of metal
skin to the fuselage.
   The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board have asked
for the maintenance and repair records of the aircraft, officials
said.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said that the cracks were located
below a window near the first-class section where repairs had been
made while the aircraft was owned by Frontier Airlines. Continental
absorbed Frontier in 1986.
   ``The rest of the airplane didn't have any problem (with cracks)
and that raises the suspicion that when the repairs were made they
were not done in accordance with all the procedures that would be
prescribed in the Boeing manual,'' said Leyden.
   He added, however, that the FAA has yet to review the repair
records and has not concluded what caused the crack.
   The FAA and NTSB also are trying to determine the age of the
crack and, if it was present last spring, why it was not discovered
as part of the inspections ordered last May after the Aloha
incident. An Aloha flight attendant was swept to her death when a
huge section of the plane broke away at 24,000 feet.
   Continental said that its plane, which has more than 55,000
takeoff and landing cycles, was inspected May 20 according to the
FAA directive, but that no cracks were found.

   American workers used a
high-speed saw and cutting torches today to scrap the first U.S.
intermediate-range nuclear missile launchers deployed at bases in
Western Europe.
   ``These won't just be torches and saws cutting heavy steal
beams. These are small steps toward a more peaceful and safe
world,'' said Christopher Evans, commander of the U.S. Army Missile
Maintenance Center in Hausen, a suburb of Frankfurt where the
launchers are being destroyed.
   Evans, a civiliam employee of the U.S. Army, said the first of
nine launchers were destroyed Tuesday, and the work was to be
finished late today. The metal was taken to a site near Frankfurt
for use as scrap.
   The launchers are being eliminated under the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Force treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last year in Washington. The
intermediate-range missiles themselves are to be destroyed in the
United States.
   Soviet inspectors and 150 journalists and photographers watched
as a dozen workers lifted, wrenched and cut through the dark green
metal of the fifth launcher for 1{ hours in a large workshed.
   The launchers, 31 feet long, are flat-bed truck trailers with
boom structures that lift a missile from the horizontal position
and hold it in place for firing.
   As workers from Martin Marietta, an American company that built
the structures, wrecked the launcher, the acrid smell of hot metal
filled the air. A large electric circular saw used to cut the
smaller pieces emitted smoke and flying sparks.
   The visitors and workers wore protective glasses as welder-like
cutting torches _ called plasma arc cutters _ severed two
doughnut-shaped collars designed to hold the missiles steady.
Later, the workmen cut in half the beams of the trailers themselves.
   The nine launchers had been deployed at a base near Stuttgart
and were hauled away Sept. 1 along with the missiles.
   Evans said the remainder of the 99 Pershing 2 missiles still
deployed in West Germany will be removed from their bases later
this year or early next year.
   All of the launchers will be destroyed at the Hausen site, he
said. In addition to the nuclear-tipped Pershing 2 missiles, 62
ground-based, nuclear cruise missiles also were stationed in West
Germany.

   One of the Americans who shared a Nobel Prize in physics said
today that being a scientist is enjoyable and winning a Nobel is
``icing on the cake.''
   ``I will recommend it to anybody,'' said Leon Lederman, 66, in a
telephone interview from his home in Batavia, Ill., where he is
director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. ``It's
really very pleasant. It's a nice way to be awakened.''
   The official calling him with the news from Stockholm at 6 a.m.
CDT ``apologized for waking me up, but I said, `That's quite all
right, anytime.'''
   Lederman shared the prize, announced today in Stockholm, Sweden,
with Melvin Schwartz, 55, a former professor at Stanford University
and now president of Digital Pathways, in Mountain View, Calif.;
and Jack Steinberger, an American citizen who lives in Switzerland.
   The three did their prize-winning work together in the early
1960s at Brookhaven National Laboratory on New York's Long Island
while they were all associated with Columbia University in New York
City.
   Schwartz said he also was asleep when he got the news by phone
at 4 a.m. PDT at his home in San Francisco.
   ``Obviously, I'm very excited about it,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``It's been a long time since we did this piece of
work.''
   ``The work was the first pioneering effort to essentially put
together an experiment in which neutrinos ... which very rarely
interact in matter at all ... interact,'' Schwartz said.
   Lederman said the prize ``was very, very pleasing. Actually,
doing science is a great deal of pleasure even if you don't win the
prize, but winning it is icing on the cake.''
   ``This is an experiment that was completed and published in
1961. Those poor guys in Stockholm have been puzzling over it ever
since and finally decided it was good stuff.''
   No Americans were among the three winners of the Nobel prize in
chemistry, also announced today in Sweden, but one of the three
West Germans getting the honor currently resides in the United
States. Johann Deisenhofer, 45, works at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute in Dallas.
   ``I can't believe it yet,'' Deisenhofer said today. ``I'm still
in a state of shock.'' As for what plans he had now that he had
won, he said: ``I haven't made up my mind yet, as you can imagine.
What I plan now is to have breakfast.''
   The chemists were honored for research into proteins involved in
photosynthesis.
   Physics winner Lederman got his bachelor's at City College of
New York before getting his master's and doctorate from Columbia.
He taught physics at the university for more than two decades.
   Schwartz received both his bachelor's degree and doctorate from
Columbia, where he taught physics for eight years before going to
Stanford University in the mid-1960s. He became president of
Digital Pathways in 1983.
   Lederman said he had no plans yet regarding the prize money and
joked, ``I haven't decided whether to buy a castle in Spain or a
string of race horses.''
   ``Science is a tremendous career to follow. You have fun all the
time, some blood, sweat and tears too, but it is ultimately
rewarding.
   ``Some day, some kid who is now in high school will find out how
to use this information (about the neutrino) to bring benefits to
all of society.''
   He said it was the first Nobel prize for a staff member at
Fermilab, where he has been director since 1979.
   ``I hope it might encourage them (federal budget makers) to send
us more money and the supercollider,'' he said, referring to the
proposed research facility for which several sites in the country
are competing.
   Fermilab, already home of one of the world's most powerful atom
smashers, is operated by a consortium of 54 research-oriented
universities in the United States and Canada under contact with the
U.S. Energy Department.
   Steinberger, 67, was born in Bad Kissingen, West Germany, and is
an American citizen. However, the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences
officially lists his nationality as Swiss. He has been a physicist
at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, in
Geneva, since 1968.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Charges Against Former CIA Agent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today dismissed charges that a
former CIA agent participated in an illegal conspiracy to help arm
the Nicaraguan rebels but gave prosecutors a chance to bring the
case anew in Virginia.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. granted a motion by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to dismiss the five-count
indictment against Joseph F. Fernandez.
   But the judge denied a request by the defense to prohibit Walsh
from seeking to obtain a new indictment in Virginia, where several
of the alleged offenses took place.
   The defense contended that Walsh had acted improperly by
bringing charges of criminal activity in the nation's capital when
four of the five alleged offenses took place across the Potomac
River in Virginia.
   Robinson's order dismissing the charges against Fernandez
without prejudice leaves Walsh free to try to obtain an indictment
from a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va.
   Walsh said in his request to dismiss the case that he would seek
to bring a new indictment in Virginia.
   Fernandez, 51, was indicted last June on charges that he
conspired with former National Security Council aide Oliver L.
North and arms dealer Richard V. Secord to set up a clandestine
arms-supply network for the Contras in defiance of a congressional
ban on such aid.
   The indictment said the conspiracy took place in Washington and
elsewhere. But Fernandez was also charged with four counts of lying
to his superiors at the CIA and the presidential commission that
investigated the Iran-Contra affair. According to the indictment
that Robinson dismissed, those alleged offenses took place at CIA
headquarters in Langley, Va.
   The defense filed a motion to dismiss the four obstruction and
false statements charges for lack of venue. Walsh countered by
asking Robinson to dismiss all five charges to give prosecutors a
chance to bring the whole case in one jurisdiction.
   Robinson, who had sharply questioned prosecutors about their
tactics at an Oct. 6 hearing, gave no reason for his decision in
the one-sentence order.

   An Indian Airlines Boeing 737 trying to
land in thick fog crashed and exploded today, killing 130 people,
officials said. Later, authorities said a plane leased from Indian
Airlines slammed into a hill during heavy rain, and all 34 people
aboard were feared dead.
   Five survivors were pulled from the burning wreckage of the 737
after it hit a tree and a power line near Ahmadabad airport, 500
miles southwest of New Delhi. The twin-engine jet was carrying 129
passengers and a six-member crew from Bombay to Ahmadabad.
   An airport police inspector, G.K. Rawal, said the pilot made
more than one landing attempt and lost contact with the control
tower about a minute before crashing at 7:40 a.m.
   But the minister of civil aviation, Shiv Raj Patil, told
reporters the pilot gave no indication of trouble during his final
contact with the tower. He said workers found the plane's flight
recorder but had not analyzed it.
   Otaji Thakor, owner of a field where the plane crashed, said the
plane wobbled before it hit the tree and power line. It exploded
about a mile from the runway, said Manmohan Singh, Ahmadabad police
director.
   Five people were taken to hospitals, Rawal said. They included a
13-year-old boy who was returning with his family from Zambia. His
parents and younger brother died.
   Three survivors were in serious condition with second-degree
burns, but all were expected to live, Rawal said.
   One survivor, Vinod Tripathy, said the plane exploded in the air
and again after crashing. He said he was burned in the second blast.
   ``I can, even at the age of 57, run like a hare,'' Tripathy was
quoted as telling the Press Trust of India news agency from his bed
at Civil Hospital.
   ``I continued to run, undeterred by the two blasts and later,
after covering a reasonable distance, fell unconscious,'' he said.
   The passenger manifest indicated the victims included six
foreigners _ two Japanese, three Germans and an industrialist from
Bahrain. The airline said one of the Germans was from West Germany
and it was checking on the other two.
   ``All 130 bodies have been recovered. It's impossible to
identify them because they are badly burned,'' said Ahmadabad
police inspector A. Ansari.
   State-run television in a special news bulletin showed rescue
workers searching the blood-stained debris, twisted luggage and
smoldering wreckage scattered among the downed electrical wires and
power poles.
   An airline official said on condition of anonymity that
authorities suspected technical malfunction complicated by the
weather caused the crash. He said they did not suspect sabotage.
   But Patil said he was not ruling out anything and ordered an
inquiry.
   Later, a Fokker Friendship propeller plane flying from Silchar
to Guwahati in Assam state slammed into a 1,400-foot hill during
torrential rains, a local official said. That crash occurred about
950 miles east of New Delhi.
   The plane, leased to Vayudoot by Indian Airlines, lost contact
with Guwahati control tower at 8:53 a.m., said C. Das, deputy
commissioner of Guwahati district. He said it crashed two minutes
later, about five miles from the airport.
   Shortly before the plane lost contact, he said, the pilot
reported visibility was zero.
   Das said 31 passengers and three crew members were aboard the
Fokker and all were feared dead. Rescue workers were unable to
reach the site because of dense forests and heavy rain, he said.
   Indian Airlines, the domestic carrier, has come under criticism
recently for its management and maintenance record and frequent
delays. Today's 737 crash was the 16th by an Indian Airlines
carrier in the past 25 years.
   It was believed to be the worst Indian Airlines crash, but
officials refused to confirm this.
   ``Any loss is bad. All crashes are the worst and most
unfortunate,'' said A.K. Vashist, an Indian Airlines spokesman in
New Delhi.
   The aircraft, acquired in 1971, is one of the oldest in the
airline's 50-plane fleet. Indian Airlines is a separate company
from India's international carrier, Air-India.
   The last Indian Airlines crash occurred on June 19 at New Delhi
airport. All survived. An investigation showed the pilot forgot to
lower the plane's landing gear.
   Boeing 737s have come under scrutiny since an Aloha Airlines
aircraft broke apart in April and made a miraculous landing with a
20-foot section missing from its fuselage. A flight attendant was
killed.
   This week, National Transportation and Safety Board officials
said cracks were found on a Continental Airlines 737 fuselage on
Oct. 5.
   The 737 entered service in 1968 is the world's most popular
commercial aircraft with more than 2,000 ordered in five different
models.
   The last 737 crash was Sept. 16, when a plane hit a flock of
birds in northwest Ethiopia. Thirty-one people died.
   Today's crashes were the second and third major accidents this
week. On Monday, a Uganda Airlines Boeing 707 crashed in Rome,
killing 32.

   The president of a chemical company has been
sentenced to five years' probation and fined $25,000 for federal
convictions involving the illegal storage and dumping of chemicals
into the South Platte River.
   Protex Industries President Donald Wilson also was sentenced
Tuesday to 500 hours of community service by U.S. District Judge
Jim R. Carrigan.
   Carrigan fined Protex $7.5 million in March, which was described
as the largest penalty ever levied in the nation for environmental
crimes. But he suspended all but $440,000 of the fine on condition
that the company pay $950,000 in restitution to three workers whose
health was damaged after they were exposed to pesticides and
solvents while working at the plant.
   Wilson pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges under an
agreement reached with prosecutors Sept. 15. He faced a maximum of
five years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   ``The past two years have been the hardest years of my life,''
Wilson said at his sentencing. ``I've seen the labors of a lifetime
in building a family business destroyed overnight.''
   Wilson said he didn't know about the environmental violations
and acted immediately to correct them.
   But prosecutor Ken Fimberg said, ``He knew the dangerous
conditions existed.''
   Prosecutors accused Wilson of hiding his assets after the
company was searched by federal agents on March 10, 1986.
   Wilson pleaded guilty to being an accessory to giving a false
statement, two counts of illegal discharge of hazardous pollutants
at the plant and two counts of failing to report those discharges.

<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded today near a border
crossing with Israel, killing at least five Israelis and wounding
11 others in an army convoy, security sources said.
   The Islamic Resistance, a coalition of Shiite Moslem factions
linked to both the Palestine Liberation Organization and Iran,
claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was a suicide
operation.
   But the security sources said on condition of anonymity that the
bomb-laden vehicle was detonated by remote control while parked
about 650 feet from the ``Good Fence'' border point about 20 miles
east of Tyre.
   United Nations sources in south Lebanon said an explosion at
1:30 p.m. destroyed four Israeli jeeps.
   ``There apparently are some casualties since there are
ambulances in the area,'' one U.N. source said on condition of
anonymity. It was not known if the victims were soldiers.
   The security sources said two Israeli helicopter gunships later
began airlifting casualties from the border village of Kfar Kela.
   Other gunships were seen strafing the fields around the scene of
the blast, apparently to protect the rescue mission from possible
guerrilla attacks.
   A witness told reporters in Tyre that he saw a civilian van
driving behind the Israeli convoy when the blast occurred. That
suggested a suicide attack, rather than a remote-controlled bomb as
reported by the security sources.
   The Islamic Resistance said in a statement relesed in Beirut,
``One of our mujahedeen (holy warriors) carried out a suicide
operation against an Israeli convoy in Kfar Kela, inflicting heavy
casualties among Israeli soldiers.''
   The explosion appeared to be the most devastating attack on
Israeli soldiers since a lone Palestinian commando flew across the
Lebanese border in a hang glider on Nov. 26, killed six soldiers
and was slain.
   Israel carved out a six-to-10-mile-wide security zone along its
border with Lebanon when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from
Lebanon in 1985 after a three-year occupation. The purpose of the
buffer was to prevent guerrilla infiltrations into Israel.
   But the estimated 1,000 Israelis who patrol the enclave along
with allied militiamen of the estimated 2,000-strong South Lebanon
Army have been regular targets of guerrilla attacks.
   Israel usually retaliates for attacks against its troops by
sending warplanes to bomb Palestinian and Lebanese Moslem guerrilla
bases in south Lebanon.
   The last anti-Israeli attack was Aug. 19 when a Lebanese car
blew up near an Israeli army jeep in the buffer zone, slightly
injuring three Israeli soldiers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration today
announced new drug approval procedures to speed development of
treatments for life-threatening diseases like AIDS.
   In essense, the new regulation would create a mechanism for the
FDA to work with drug companies in the earliest stages of a drug's
development to refine preliminary tests in animals and humans to
get the most useful data in the shortest possible time.
   While that clearly could shorten the approval time for drugs
that subsequently prove to be safe and effective, in most cases it
would require a larger financial commitment from drug developers
long before they have any realistic assessment of whether the drug
will eventually pan out and thus enable them to recover their
research investment.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young acknowledged at a news
conference that the revised procedures would show results only if
private pharmaceutical companies take advantage of new
opportunities to get the FDA involved in earlier stages of drug
development.
   The word ``may'' is scattered throughout the proposal,
establishing clearly that it creates new options for drug companies
rather than requirements in the drug approval process.
   The regulation is being published in the Federal Register as an
``interim rule'' with a 60-day public comment period, meaning it is
effective immediately.
   Young said repeatedly that he did not want to ``overpromise''
the likelihood of dramatic changes in early development of drugs
for AIDS, cancer and other life-threatening diseases.
   Nonetheless, he defended the agency against charges by AIDS
activists that the new regulations are politically motivated to
help the campaign of Vice President George Bush _ who has headed
the Reagan administration's effort on easing regulatory red tape at
the FDA and other federal agencies.
   Young pointed out that Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis agreed at their first debate that they are in essential
agreement on how to cope with the AIDS epidemic, including support
for federal anti-discrimination to protect people carrying the AIDS
virus.
   The FDA commissioner used two analogies in explaining his view
of how the new regulations would work: as a college professor
giving students a clear idea of the answers he was looking for on
an essay test question, rather than leaving for the students to
guess what was on the professor's mind; and of the agency being
more like a baseball catcher _ ``helping call the signals'' _
rather than strictly as an umpire _ ``just calling safe and out.''
   In simplified terms, the new procedures encourage drug
developers to meet with FDA regulators when they are getting ready
to go into Phase II testing _ after preliminary animal and human
tests have established the safety of a drug.
   The idea is that the FDA would help the companies design studies
specifically greared to answering the scientific questions about a
drug that the agency considers most pressing.
   If that happens, and the Phase II tests clearly establish that
the drug is effective, the final step before approval _ Phase III
testing on reasonably large numbers of patients _ could be sharply
curtailed or perhaps even bypassed.
   Emphasizing that the new procedures would be used only for drugs
designed to treat life-threatening diseases where no effective
therapy is available, Young said, ``a treatment could be approved
even if some questions reamin to be answered by researchers.''
   ``There might be questions about the very best way to use a
drug, the lowest dose that was effective, for example,'' he said.
``Such questions could be studied after the drug was approved and
would not delay its approval.''

   Five nuns who have locked
themselves in their monastery protesting liberalizing changes in
their way of life are forgetting their vow of obedience, says their
mother superior.
   As the dispute has escalated among the Carmelite nuns over how
to live a cloistered life of prayer, both sides have turned to the
media to plead their cases.
   Mother Teresa Hewitt, prioress of the Monastery of the Most
Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, called in reporters Tuesday
and in front of bright lights and cameras called the rebellion
``attempted anarchy.''
   She said she has received hate mail from around the country
since the five nuns moved into the monastery's infirmary Oct. 4 and
demanded their religious order return to a more conservative
lifestyle.
   The five nuns say they are protesting the innovations of
allowing them some use of radio, television, candy and newspapers.
But the real issue, said Mother Teresa, is their refusal to obey
her.
   ``I will not give in to attempted anarchy, of a total disregard
for the rules of the order,'' she said. ``What if the governor of
Massachusetts was voted president and all the people who supported
Mr. Bush rebelled?''
   ``The nuns have an obligation, because of their vows, to respect
their prioress whether they like the person or don't like the
person.''
   Mother Teresa defended the changes she has made since becoming
prioress 14 months ago, saying the Roman Catholic Church is
constantly evolving and that the changes were well within the
constitution of the order.
   Sister John of the Cross, one of the barricaded nuns who has
acted as a spokeswoman, said their allegiance to the order's rules
supersedes allegiance to their superior.
   ``We're saying she has deviated from the rules,'' Sister John
said in a telephone interview. ``We vow obedience to the ruling
constitution, and it's the reponsibility of the prioress to uphold
the constitution.''
   It is up to the Vatican to issue a final report and
recommendations for settling the matter, according to the Rev.
Kevin Culligan, who tried unsuccesfully to resolve the dispute last
week.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on protecting whistle-blowers:
   Headed for the president's desk is a bill imposing major new
protections for federal workers who expose bureaucratic fraud,
abuse, corruption and waste. ...
   Information revealed by a whistle-blower can certainly embarrass
an entrenched bureaucracy and ... the administration. But, if
corrective action is taken, the embarrassment can be ... quickly
replaced with pride in a better-run agency. ...
   The government will now have to provide ``clear and convincing

   It's taken four years of often bitter struggle to forge a

   President Reagan should now take the next step and sign this

   Almost all 200 of the 17-year-old high school students
interviewed for a recent ABC-TV documentary could identify Michael
Jackson and Madonna, but fewer than half recognized the names of
Daniel Ortega and the Ayatollah Khomeini.
   One student thought the Ayatollah was a Russian gymnast.
   Two-thirds of the students didn't know about Chernobyl. One
guessed that it was Cher's full name. More forgivably, perhaps,
only a third knew the names of this year's vice presidential
candidates.
   Asked to identify the Holocaust, one student guessed it was a
``Jewish holiday.''
   Mind you, the youngsters interviewed, while perhaps not the
brightest or the best, were not inner-city dropouts, but seniors at
respected, middle-class high schools.
   Little wonder that ABC, in titling its documentary based on the
survey, decided to call it ``America's Kids: Why They Flunk.''

   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on the Philippine bases accord:
   Agreement on terms for the next two years of operation of U.S.
military bases in the Philippines is an encouraging sign that the
two long-time allies can continue to work together.
   It offers hope that the government of President Corazon Aquino
will agree to let the bases remain when the current agreement
governing their use expires in 1991.
   Although Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, the
principal U.S. installations, may not be irreplaceable, they are
certainly very important in meeting U.S. strategic needs in the
Western Pacific and Indian Ocean.
   Moving those facilities elsewhere would be difficult at best.

   Times Record, Brunswick, Maine, on the ACLU and the presidential
campaign:
   The American Civil Liberties Union has taken a shellacking at
the hands of Vice President George Bush during the presidential
campgain.
   As the ACLU is a nonpartisan organization devoted to protecting
the basic rights set forth in the Constitution, one could
reasonably infer that Bush also takes a dim view of civil liberties.
   That's probably not the case, but the fact that Bush has gotten
such mileage out of criticizing Gov. Michael Dukakis' ACLU
membership suggests many Americans have little appreciation of the
civil liberties they enjoy. ...
   In the waning days of the Bush-Dukakis campaign, voters should
think twice about candidates who cast aspersions on those who
cherish and defend American civil liberties.

   The Evening Times, Pawtucket, R.I., on the presidential debates:
   The most unfortunate aspect of the presidential debates is not
that they are not true debates, but that they serve so little
purpose.
   As media-managed personality profiles _ meeting the candidates
up-close-and-personal in a highly structured format with little
room for serious discussion _ they are marvelous conveniences.
   They give every voter in the nation the opportunity to see the
two candidates side-by-side, to view their mannerisms, hear their
voices, check out their apparel.
   Of course, if that's what presidential elections are all about,
we could just as easily play out the race in the pages of
Gentleman's Quarterly.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on presidential news conferences:
   The presidential debates are over, but the larger question of
how often sitting presidents should face questioning from reporters
remains.
   A new report from the Harvard Commission on the Presidential
News Conference says such meetings don't come (often) enough, and
the delays hurt both the president and the press. ...
   Made up of a panel of journalists and scholars, the commission
said the presidential news conference has fallen into a ``serious
state of disarray'' during the Reagan White House.
   As a result, its report said, what should be a steady flow of
meaningful information becomes a stream that is first dammed up,
then released in a torrent to shouting reporters who are just as
eager to pounce on a gaffe as on a significant news story. ...
   The commission's recommendation _ twice monthly conferences
during the daytime, to ``encourage more substantive and useful
exchanges,'' and six meetings a year on prime-time television _
would be more fair to everyone involved.
   The next president should take it seriously.

   Mccomb (Miss.) Enterprise-Journal on America's return to space
flights:
   The recent, successful flight of the spaceship Discovery is a
cause for reflection on the United State space program. ....
   The only other country in the world which can even challegne the
U.S. record in space is the Soviet Union, which undertook 1,733
successful space launches from 1957 through 1985 _ compared to 844
for the United States.
   Only three other nations _ Japan, India and China _ and the
European Space Agency together undertook a total of 53 space
launches during the same period. ...
   So despite a year and a half of re-evaluation and retrenching in
the wake of the Challenger disaster, the American space program
remains the pace-setter, the ``team to beat'' in establishing new
frontiers in the far reaches of space.

   The Peninsula Daily News, Port Angeles, Wash., on families:
   A few weeks ago, when it became apparent that the so-called
family issues were generating more talk than action in Congress,
Sen. Christopher Dodd observed, ``Never in the history of American
politics has there been a constituency so popular but with so
little political clout as the American family.''
   The Connecticut Democrat was proven right a few days ago. Major
bills designed to help American families died when the Senate could
not find the votes to end a filibuster by conservative Republicans.
   The lost legislation dealt with child care, unpaid leaves for
workers having babies or serious family illnesses, and tougher
penalties in child pornography cases.
   The package did not offer families all that much, but it was too
much for conservative opponents. It would be interesting to know
what they are willing to offer.

   Marietta (Ga.) Daily Journal on the National Service Act:
   Last year, Sen. (Sam) Nunn, (D-Ga.), as chairman of the
Democratic Leadership Council, put forward a radical and
deceptively simple idea: The National Service Act, a program
similar to the G.I. Bill.
   Under the plan, the nation's youth would be able to volunteer
for either military or civilian service.
   In return, they would be given a $10,000 voucher at the end of
their tour of duty to be used for education, vocational training or
as a down payment on a first home.
   The plan's cost in real dollars will be much less than the $15
billion price tag Nunn has placed on it.
   By allowing citizens to earn their college education, the need
for many federal loans and grants would disappear. ... The high
cost of the current all-volunteer military would be reduced. ...
   In an age where brilliance and innovative leadership have given
way to petty politics and demagoguery, Nunn's plan shines out like
a beacon.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on the presidential debates:
   Pit bull personalities licking their chops in anticipation of a
major gaffe in (the Oct. 13) presidential debate were disappointed.
   So too were those cursed with an annoying passion for equating
the debates with sporting events. There were no home runs, no
knockouts, no major blunders.
   Measured in terms of poise, confidence and image projection,
Michael Dukakis won the first contest Sept. 25. George Bush won the
second. ...
   But measured in terms of substance and in terms of stands on
issues and the ability to express them within the restricted
confines of these two so-called debates, score it a draw for both
men, both times. ...
   These debates have been far more useful than the meaningless

   Press-Telegram, Long Beach, Calif., on the prison furlough issue:
   Since the beginning of the campaign, Vice President Bush has
been bashing Michael Dukakis with the accusation that Massachusetts
releases hardened criminals who use their prison furloughs to
commit more crimes.
   Dukakis, rather than discuss furlough programs, shoots back that
the federal government's own furlough program releases people who
commit crimes in the short time they are outside, and that Bush, as
an administration official, has to accept responsibility for those
failures as well. ...
   A survey conducted by Contact Center, a non-profit criminal
justice information clearinghouse, found that federal and state
furlough programs gave some 53,000 prisoners more than 200,000
furloughs and encountered relatively few problems. ...
   Nearly half of the states reported to the Contact Center that
their programs are 98 percent successful. Six said they were 100
percent successful. ...
   Just one state _ Indiana _ reported problems so serious they
forced suspension of the program.

barricaded themselves inside a Morris Township, N.J., monastery is
an ironic commentary on the nuns' complaint that a withdrawn,
spiritual life is nearly impossible in today's world.
   The nuns, who are among the monastery's youngest members, oppose
the prioress' decision to impose modern intrusions, such as
television and snack foods, on their quest for a quiet
contemplative life.
   They feel such moves will pull them away from the spiritual
goals they had upon joining the church. ...
   Despite their desire for avoidance of today's world, much of

   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on the welfare reform bill:
   President Reagan signed a major welfare reform bill into law
last week that should free many Americans from government
dependency.
   The major provisions of the new law require states for the first
time to offer people on welfare a variety of education, training
and work programs.
   It features mandatory work provisions for some welfare
recipients and provides child care assistance to help them keep
jobs.
   At long last the government appears ready to break the welfare
cycle that in many cases has shackled generation after generation
to the welfare rolls.
   We commend Congress for passing the new law and the president
for signing it.

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on federal auto mileage
standards:
   Building big cars is what Detroit does best. But federal auto
mileage standards have threatened to put a crimp in the operation.
   In 1975 Congress established progressively higher
miles-per-gallon fleet requirements in order to conserve gasoline,
peaking at 27.5 miles per gallon by 1985.
   The government's action set off a scramble in the industry to
make smaller cars, a race in which American manufacturers, with the
exception of Chrysler, came out second-best to foreign companies.
   General Motors and Ford faced deep trouble. They weren't making
enough high-mileage small autos to keep their overall fleet average
at 27.5 mpg. So the U.S. Transportation Department relaxed the
standard, as it was allowed to do under law.
   Despite demands from some quarters that Detroit be required to
comply with the 27.5 mpg standard, U.S. Transportation Secretary
James Burnley decided to set it at 26.5, a slight increase over
1988 but a figure that GM and Ford apparently can live with.
   Burnley made a sensible decision.

   Las Vegas Review-Journal on the vice presidential debate:
   The inquisitors at the vice presidential debate kept hammering
on Dan Quayle ... about what exactly he would do should something
happen to George Bush and Quayle ascend to the presidency.
   Quayle said he would pray and then call in the president's
advisers. That wasn't a good enough answer for Tom Brokaw, et al.,
who kept nagging the nominee.
   In the interest of fairness, the panel should have fired the
same question at Lloyd Bentsen.
   Watching Quayle squirm was entertaining but watching his
opponent explain the policy ramifications of a Bentsen presidency
would have been fascinating.
   That's because Bentsen differs with his running mate, Michael
Dukakis, on just about everything.
   Should Dukakis become president and some evil befall him, we can
imagine Lloyd Bentsen working mightily to undo just about every
major Dukakis policy. How come Brokaw and the gang didn't ask
Bentsen about that?

   Daily Journal, Fergus Falls, Minn., on the media and
presidential campaigns:
   In a campaign that's been described as inane, among other
things, it was fitting that George Bush was asked during (the Oct.
13) debate about the negative tone of this year's presidential
campaign. ...
   Bush ... pointed out, rightly, that the media (had) to take some
of the blame.
   Instead of focusing on detailed policies and complicated
positions, the national television networks look instead for the
snappy one-liners that fit neatly into their newscasts.
   Pity the poor candidates this year and in future years who can't
condense their positions to five words or less.
   It is no doubt easier for candidates to repeat slogans than to
explain their positions; why should they take the difficult course
when that results only in their being ignored?
   Candidates have a responsibility to talk about issues. The news
media has a responsibility to ask questions about the issues and
not allow candidates to so easily take the low road.
   Both the candidates and the media have taken the easy way out in
this campaign; the American public should demand more the next time
around.

   San Antonio Express-News on getting qualified federal workers:
   The federal government is losing its ability to hire employees
qualified to perform increasingly complicated and technical work
because of low salaries, declining prestige and needless
frustration, the Reagan administration recently told Congress.
   The result, according to a new report prepared for the federal
Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, is a ``slowly emerging
crisis of competence'' because skilled workers are leaving federal
service.
   Obviously, the next administration should try to mend fences
with the federal work force. Obviously, federal employees should be
granted raises as frequently as members of Congress, the Cabinet
and other top appointive posts.
   Contrary to what some politicians think, the government is only
as competent and united as those who work for it _ not those who
are elected or appointed to it.

   Vice President George Bush today called
for an end to partisan conflict in U.S. foreign policy, even as he
renewed criticism of his Democratic rival's foreign policy views.
   Campaigning in Michigan, which campaign manager Lee Atwater
labeled one of five ``key states'' in the Nov. 8 election, Bush
said the president and Congress should ``extend to each other the
hand of partnership, not the finger of blame.''
   In a speech at the University of Michigan, Bush said the
president's leadership ``involves the national interest beyond our
shores, an interest important to all Americans of whatever
political persuasion. That's why I want to revive bipartisanship. I
want to make it once more the vibrant heart of a foreign policy
that is decided by a debate which ends at the water's edge.''
   But he disparaged the qualifications of Democratic opponent
Michael Dukakis in this field.
   ``Lacking experience in foreign affairs, he has a rather
unrealistic view of American's role and the way in which we lead,''
Bush said of Dukakis.
   He also said Dukakis ``apparently believes that the Soviet
economic problems have left them too weak to make trouble. The
liberal Massachusetts governor seems to think that all we need to
do is offer Moscow economic inducements and a less agressive, less
threatening Soviet Union will be the result. He's wrong.''
   Bush called on Dukakis ``to join me in a bipartisan
reaffirmation that we are not going to reduce our troops in Europe
unilaterally.''
   Contending that the United States and Europe must forge closer
ties, Bush promised if elected to propose an early NATO summit
meeting to adopt a strategy for conventional arms control in
Europe, to discuss effective deployment of Allied forces, to agree
on common diplomacy toward East Europe and the Soviet Union, and to
influence public opinion on the need for the alliance.
   Atwater said that in addition to Michigan, the key states are
Illinois, California, New Jersey and Ohio.
   In addition, Atwater said, there are a range of states, like New
York, that are still competitive.
   Despite Bush's growing and substantial lead in opinion polls,
Atwater claimed the campaign is not changing its strategy, and Bush
will continue to campaign as if he is behind.
   In a pair of campus campaign appearances Tuesday, Bush began his
speeches by telling supporters the race for the White House is not
over, and won't be until Nov. 8.
   ``The election is still close and there are many undecided
voters,'' said Bush, who holds a 17-point lead in the latest
nationwide survey.
   The vice president predicted a ``tough battle'' for the rest of
the campaign and told a rally of about 7,000 people at Southwest
Missouri State University in Springfield that he would ``campaign
like an underdog.''
   ``The worst thing to do would be to show a complacency I don't
feel or an overconfidence that I do not feel,'' Bush insisisted to
reporters Tuesday morning before a speech on foreign affairs at
Westminster College in Fulton, Mo.
   Bush was making a series of appearances today in Michigan, where
he was expected to focus on his defense and foreign policy themes
of this week. Former President Gerald Ford, a Michigan native, was
joining Bush on the campaign trail.
   Despite the Republican candidate's repeated cautionary comments,
Bush supporters at Southwest Missouri clearly had victory in their
sights. Around the gymansium were banners reading ``On the Road to
the White House,'' ``The legend begins, the legacy continues,''
``Victory '88 for Our Man,'' and ``George is awesome.''
   The crowd cheered wildly and booed on cue for Bush's standard
Dukakis-bashing lines.
   Earlier at Westminster College, Bush did not mention Dukakis in
his speech on U.S.-Soviet relations. The vice president called for
a cautionary attitude toward the Soviets and a ``peace through
strength'' policy.
   Bush recalled that the campus was the site of former British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famous 1946 ``Iron Curtain''
speech. Churchill said a post-war Iron Curtain of secrecy and
self-imposed isolation had surrounded the Soviet Union and the
communist Eastern bloc.
   Bush said that curtain is rusting today but that ``in Europe and
other parts of the world, we have yet to see the full promise of
Soviet change turn into change itself.''
   If elected president, Bush said he would remain wary of Soviet
intentions, despite more promising signals from Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies.
   ``Now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the
Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Bush, asked why he talked about being an underdog when polls
show him handily ahead, said the campaign will not ``lighten up.
We're going to stay right down to the wire. ... If I find anybody
letting up in my campaign, they're history.''

<TEXT>
   An American held hostage in Iran settled a
$60 million libel suit with the former owners of the Daily News of
Los Angeles, which had reported he was under investigation for drug
trafficking.
   Jerry Plotkin, one of the Americans held for 444 days in the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 to 1981, did not disclose the terms
of the settlement, but said he received enough to ``compensate me
for the substantial damages I have suffered.''
   ``My 444 days in captivity were a living hell. In many ways the
almost eight years since my release have been equally torturous
because of what I considered to be false accusations against me,''
he said. ``With this settlement, now at last I am truly a free
man.''
   The Daily News story appeared Jan. 21, 1981, one day after Iran
freed 52 American hostages after one year and 79 days in captivity.
The story quoted unidentified law enforcement sources.
   The newspaper, then owned by the Van Nuys Publishing Co., a
subsidiary of the Tribune Co. in Chicago, said in the front-page
story that police had investigated Plotkin before he went to Iran
and reported he was a target of a federal investigation focusing on
international drug trafficking.
   The story gained national attention and was challenged by
Plotkin, who was taken hostage when he was visiting the U.S.
Embassy and was the only hostage who was not a U.S. Embassy
employee or military person. The day the story appeared, federal
drug agents and the Los Angeles Police Department denied any
investigation of Plotkin.
   The Van Nuys Publishing Co. on Tuesday released a jointly agreed
upon statement. The company said the story was published ``with a
good faith belief in (its) truth.'' But it said evidence that has
come to light since the lawsuit was filed establishes that Plotkin
was not under investigation and had gone to Iran ``for completely
legitimate business purposes.''
   The Daily News now is owned by media and sports entrepreneur
Jack Kent Cooke, and its current management and owners were not
involved in the Plotkin suit.

   Republican Dan Quayle met behind closed doors
with Jewish backers today, conceding Republicans have done too
little to convey their message to the Jewish community, but vowing
to step up that effort.
   ``Evidently we haven't done as good a job as we should have in
communicating where the Republican Party stands vis-a-vis Israel,
where the Republican Party stands vis-a-vis the Jewish community,''
Quayle said as he emerged from the meeting in a Chicago hotel.
   The early meeting followed a day of barnstorming rural Illinois.
Quayle toured the state Tuesday pledging a vigorous fight to win
his native Midwest from a Democratic ticket that he said is out of
touch with the region, and he told displaced workers there that
unemployment is a consequence of ``the way our dynamic economy
operates.''
   Quayle was continuing his tour of small-town middle America in
Missouri, but he started focusing on a Jewish vote he considered is
heavily Democratic.
   ``If you look at the numbers they're not where they should be,''
he said. ``We're not going to be satisfied until we get a clear
majority, and we don't have that right now.''
   He dismissed suggestions that members of an ethnic support group
for Bush who were fired for reported anti-Semitic connections would
damage the ticket among Jewish voters.
   He said that incident was handled ``with dispatch'' and hasn't
harmed the ticket.
   Quayle spoke to students and toured farms Tuesday as his bus
caravan snaked through downstate Illinois before arriving in
Chicago. The Republican vice presidential candidate planned to make
stops in Kansas City and across Missouri today.
   ``George Bush and I are going to be like tigers between now and
Nov. 8,'' Quayle said. ``We have an election to win.''
   During his tour, Quayle lashed out at presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis as a ``conceited liberal'' and contended the
Massachusetts Democrat ``looks down'' on the region.
   ``They think they're better than we are,'' Quayle told cheering
college supporters in Kankakee. ``We say `good night Mike' because
he never said good morning to America.
   ``We are the ones who are talking about the future. We are the
ones talking about moving this country forward.''
   With many parts of the Midwest industrial sector suffering from
decline, Quayle spent time touting his role in job training
legislation, meeting with displaced workers to give them a pep talk.
   ``If you lost a job, it's not your fault,'' Quayle said. ``It's
not that you didn't work hard.
   ``It happens to be the way our dynamic economy operates. That
power of positive thinking, there's no substitute for it.
   ``You've come to the right place. This is where you can get some
help as far as redirection.''
   Aides had scheduled a folksy _ and photogenic _ series of
small-town stops throughout the day. Quayle met with hundreds of
denim-clad youngsters on a farm with hay bales and a giant flag in
the background. He also stopped to buy a Halloween pumpkin he said
would be turned into ``monster Dukakis.''
   As the bus caravan snaked northward, Quayle occasionally spoke
through a loudspeaker mounted on top to groups of schoolchildren
gathered along the roadside.
   ``This campaign is full of controlled spontaneity,'' said
spokesman David Prosperi.
   But at the same time, Quayle and his aides promised an
aggressive final three weeks of the campaign.
   And while Quayle continued to warn against overconfidence, he
was upbeat after meeting cheering college students in Kankakee.
   ``I'm beginning to feel what it's going to be like on election
night,'' Quayle said.
   Most polls have shown the Republican ticket with a persistent
lead, and some have shown it widening in recent days.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen accused Republicans
today of turning the presidential campaign into a ``mud-wrestling
festival'' with attacks on Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis that
have no regard for the truth.
   ``They have force-fed sound bites to the evening news and
laughed behind the backs of voters demanding some honesty about
America's future,'' said the Democratic vice presidential candidate.
   ``They have viciously slandered the patriotism and record of
Michael Dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness and
light when they are called to account,'' Bentsen said in a speech
prepared for delivery at Stanford University.
   Bentsen is seeking to bolster the Democrats' sagging fortunes in
the presidential race with a hard-hitting assault on what he terms
the GOP ticket's campaign of distortion and cynicism.
   The Texas senator said the attacks by Republican nominee George
Bush and running mate Dan Quayle were ``reducing the caliber of a
national campaign to the level of a mud-wrestling festival out at
the Cow Palace,'' a sports arena near San Francisco about 30 miles
north of Palo Alto.
   ``They have said things about Mike Dukakis that in Texas we
wouldn't say about a rattlesnake on a lawn at a church picnic,'' he
said.
   Bentsen was winding up two days of campaigning for California's
47 electoral votes before flying to Kentucky.
   Bentsen had been hinting at some dissatisfication with Dukakis'
failure to respond strongly to the Republican attacks. He uncorked
his own criticisms on Tuesday in a speech at the University of
California at Los Angeles and then at a rally in San Jose.
   ``They don't seem to mind if it's untrue. Doesn't seem to worry
them if it's misleading. Can't seem to care if it's downright
mean,'' he said. ``It's just the same kind of half-baked proposals
they throw up in debate.
   ``If it sounds good say it, if it sells, package it, if it looks
good nominate it,'' he said.
   Bentsen and Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, he said, have
``been a little incredulous sometimes and haven't answered back as
we should.'' But he said those pointing to the ``open casket'' were
listening to Republicans.
   ``Well, they haven't heard the last from Mike Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen,'' he said.
   ``This election is too important ... to sit back and accept the
cynical view of politics that guides the campaign of the
opposition,'' he said.
   In his UCLA address to about 2,000 students, Bentsen traced the
Republican tactics back to July, when the Democrats held a big lead
in the polls and the Republicans were worried.
   ``And the image makers came in and said, `Don't you worry about
that. Wait `till we get through with Michael Dukakis and spend
millions of dollars on television cutting him up ... And then we'll
turn to a campaign of a sweetness and light and take it on home,'
'' he said.
   Bentsen's campaign was bolstered Tuesday by the presence of Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the conservative chairman of the Senate Armes
Services Committee. Nunn hosted Bentsen at UCLA and later
introduced him at a McDonnell Douglas aerospace plant in Orange
County.
   Nunn said the Democratic candidates want to spend more of the
total defense spending on conventional weapons such as planes and
tanks while the Republicans want to spend more on nuclear missiles.
   Attempts by the Republicans to scare people into thinking the
Democrats would disarm America were ``gross distortions,'' the
Georgia Democrat said.
   ``The Democratic ticket has got to hit back,'' Nunn said. But,
he added that it was Dukakis, not Bentsen, who had to head that
effort.

<HEAD>Pentagon May Halt Tobacco Sales In Commissaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite strong objections by congressional
leaders, the Pentagon is considering a plan to stop the sale of
tobacco products in military commissaries and to raise the prices
of cigarettes and alcohol sold in post exchanges.
   According to defense sources, who asked not to be named, Deputy
Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV is receptive to the idea and
has asked his staff to draft a directive that would implement the
changes on Jan. 1.
   Taft would normally be the top Pentagon official to deal with
such matters. But several congressmen have now asked Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci to intervene, calling the proposal
``ill advised (and) hastily conceived.''
   ``This is a very dangerous precedent for commissary and exchange
operation, and it tampers with a very important fringe benefit for
servicemen,'' Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, said in an interview.
   ``It would really penalize the people assigned overseas.''
   Leath, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's
morale, welfare and recreation panel, said the two Democrats and
two Republicans who serve on that panel with him had joined in
writing to Carlucci last week. They include Reps. Bill Nichols,
D-Ala.; Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass.; David O'B. Martin, R-N.Y., and
Jack Davis, R-Ill.
   If Carlucci doesn't stop the plan from going forward, ``then we
are prepared to stop it legislatively,'' Leath declared.
   The idea of changing tobacco and alcohol sales policies was
advanced quietly last Sept. 28 by the Defense Resources Board, the
Pentagon's highest-ranking review board for military programs.
   Maj. David Super, a Pentagon spokesman, on Wednesday
acknowledged the board's action and agreed the department was
considering changes, but said he knew of no tentative decisions
having been made by Taft.
   ``The DRB has made the recommendation to change sales
policies,'' Super said.
   ``This would be another step in an on-going effort to promote
good health for service members and dependents _ smoking cessation
and deglamorization of alcohol. The price increases also could
generate more morale, welfare and recreation funds.''
   The sources said the plan being considered by Taft would remove
all tobacco products from the commissaries _ or military grocery
stores _ and allow their sale only at the post exchanges, which are
more like drug stores.
   Cigarettes sold at the exchanges would be priced near regular
retail rates, and liquor prices within the exchange system would
also be raised to within 5 percent of the local civilian market,
the sources said.
   In addition to the congressional opposition, Taft has received a
memo from Grant S. Green Jr., the assistant secretary for force
management and personnel, opposing any change in commissary and
exchange policy, the sources said.
   Green is also asserting that any sales ban or price hikes would
be perceived by servicemen as a reduction in benefits.
   The Defense Department, through an educational campaign launched
by former Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, has been attempting to
reduce the use of cigarettes and alcohol among active-duty
servicemen for more than two years.
   That war on smoking was touched off in March 1986 after
Weinberger considered _ and then rejected _ a ban on the sale of
cigarettes or an increase in tobacco prices at military stores.
   Weinberger shied away from that step because he said he feared
setting a precedent that would allow the singling out of particular
products for special pricing.
   Currently, all products sold at commissaries are priced at cost
plus a 5 percent surcharge. In the case of cigarettes, that
produces a roughly 35 percent discount compared to retail prices.
   ``This is a very dangerous precedent for the system as a
whole,'' Leath said, echoing Weinberger's point.
   ``If they can do it with alcohol and tobacco, then what's next?
Raise the price of butter because the cholesterol is bad for you?''

<HEAD>Excerpts From Citation For Nobel In Chemisty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the citation for
the Nobel Prize in chemistry and background material from the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences. Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber and
Hartmut Michel of West Germany won the prizeo Wednesday for
determining the structure of proteins that plants and some bacteria
need to convert sunlight to energy.
   They (the prizewinners) are the first to succeed in unravelling
the full details of how a membrane-bound protein is built up,
revealing the structure of the molecule atom by atom. The protein
is taken from a bacterium which, like green plants and algae, uses
light energy from the sun to build organic substances. All our
nourishment has its origin in this process, which is called
photosynthesis and which is a condition for all life on earth.
   The organic substances serve as nourishment for both plants and
animals. Using the oxygen in the air, they consume these nutrients
through what is termed cellular respiration. The conversion of
energy in photosyntheisis and cellular respiration takes place
through transport of electrons via a series of proteins, which are
bound in special membranes. These membrane-bound proteins are
difficult to obtain in a crystalline form that makes it possible to
determine their structure, but in 1982 Hartmut Michel succeeded in
doing this. Determination of the structure was then carried out in
collaboration with Johann Deisenhofer and Robert Huber between 1982
and 1985. ...
   The structural determination rewarded has considerable chemical
importance far beyond the field of photosynthesis. Many central
biological functions in addition to photosynthesis and cell
respiration are associated with membrane-bound proteins. Examples
are transport of chemical substances between cells, hormone action
and nerve impulses. The structure of the reaction center has
clarified the principles governing the three dimensional structure
of proteins spanning biological membranes, e.g. ion pumps and other
transport proteins. Thanks to the method of crystallization
developed by Hartmut Michel, the prospects of obtaining detailed
structural information also for other membrane proteins have
improved...

<HEAD>Charges Filed Accyse Comair Airline Managers of Coercing Drug
Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Comair Airline executives, accused of
holding employees against their will in a hotel room to get them to
undergo drug tests, have been charged with misdemeanor criminal
charges.
   Boone County Attorney Larry Crigler said Tuesday he filed a
total of 25 charges of unlawful imprisonment against six Comair
managerial-level officials at the request of five employees.
   The unlawful imprisonment charges are second-degree misdemeanors
that carry a possible sentence of up to a year in prison and a $500
fine on each count, Crigler said.
   Although the employees were not physically restrained in the
hotel, they were detained against their will by the authority of
their company superiors, Crigler said. ``They were told they
couldn't leave.''
   The incident allegedly took place Sept. 15 in a room at the
Radisson Hotel at Greater Cincinnati International Airport. The
airport is in Kentucky, near the border with Ohio.
   The five employees say airline officials illegally held them and
coerced them into taking surprise drug tests. The employees say the
tests showed no evidence of drug use.
   Comair attorney Richard Creighton said that the company denies
that there had been any criminal behavior. When asked Tuesday if
the employees had been free to leave the hotel room, Creighton
replied: ``Of course.''
   Also Tuesday, Comair filed a libel lawsuit against the attorney
for the five crew members, Garry L. Edmondson. The lawsuit said
Edmondson told reporters at a news conference that Comair managers
``shanghaied'' the pilot and four flight attendants and used
``Gestapo-like tactics'' to obtain urine samples.
   The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, contends the
statements damaged the reputation of Comair, a regional airline
based at Greater Cincinnati International Airport. The lawsuit was
filed Tuesday in Hamilton County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court.
   Edmondson said he had not seen the lawsuit and declined to
comment on it except to say, ``sounds desperate to me.''
   Lastl month, Comair fired five other employees, including three
pilots, reportedly because the five either failed drug tests or
admitted that they used drugs while off duty. The three pilots have
filed grievances against the company.

   President Reagan said today that Americans
will put George Bush in the White House because he's running
against a Democratic ticket whose liberal positions ``only a
McGovern could love.''
   In a speech inside the three-tiered Ohio State University sports
arena, Reagan said the Democratic ticket of Michael Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen would pursue policies detrimental to economic growth
and the nation's defense.
   Using the word ``liberal'' 15 times in a speech planned for 15
minutes, the president also lashed out at Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, as a big spender, and urged his defeat by Republican
challenger George Voinovich, mayor of Cleveland.
   ``When it comes to big spending, the National Taxpayers Union
has given him their `Big Spenders' award,'' Reagan said of
Metzenbaum, who has vigorously opposed many administration policies.
   The arena was festooned with banners with such legends as
``Thanks for eight great years'' and ``We'll miss you.''
   A small section of the bleachers was occupied by students
holding up Dukakis-Bentsen signs and homemade posters with messages
such as ``Bye-Bye Bonzo'' and ``Good Riddance Ronnie.''
   The speech was interrupted at times with such shouts as ``I
would rather be a liberal than be a fascist.''
   Reagan acknowledged the hecklers by saying, after enumerating
the advantages of his administration for young people, ``And that
even applies to the noisy few that are in here.''
   From Columbus, Reagan heads to Bowling Green for another rally
for the Bush-Quayle ticket and then to Cincinnati to address a
fund-raising dinner in Voinovich's honor.
   Reagan returned to the same state _ with its 23 electoral votes
_ where he took an old-fashioned whistlestop tour through towns and
countryside on the ``Heartland Special'' during his 1984
re-election campaign.
   Without naming Dukakis, Reagan likened the Democratic
standard-bearer to liberal former Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D., who
lost to President Nixon by a landslide in 1972.
   ``My friends, everything that you and I and George Bush have
worked for these last eight years _ everything _ could be lost
faster than you can say the Pledge of Allegiance,'' he said. ``The
liberals talk about reaching for the center but, from the economy
to national defense, they've taken positions only a McGovern could
love.''
   Noting last week's Bush-Dukakis debate, Reagan said that ``I
don't often feel sorry for liberals, but I came close.
   ``I couldn't help thinking, the problem with those fellows on
the other side is not camera angles or lighting. It's not whether
their candidate is likable or not,'' the president said.
   ``No, it's the very thing that they've spent this campaign
trying desperately to hide ... they're out of the mainstream of
American politics.''
   Robert T. Bennett, chairman of the Ohio Republican state central
committee, thinks Reagan could make a difference in Ohio, where
Bush and Dukakis have been running fairly close.
   ``His (Reagan's) approval rating in Franklin County (Columbus)
is 70 percent,'' Bennett said in a telephone interview Tuesday from
his Columbus office. ``Statewide, it's in the 60 percent range.''
   Bennett said some polls in the state have shown the Bush lead
over Dukakis as high as 11 percentage points, ``but I discount
them.''
   ``I think we're in good shape right now, but I don't think it's
in the bag by any stretch of the imagination,'' Bennett said.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, targeting a rural
bastion of Republican strength in presidential elections, said
today he cares about the future of rural America while Republican
rival George Bush ``has never expressed any particular concern.''
   En route to a rally at a southern Illinois farm, Dukakis said,
``I don't remember any time in this campaign he's expressed any
concern about family farmers. They (the Republicans) like corporate
operators.''
   The farm owned by Jim and Mabel Reed was the Democratic
nominee's first stop on a bus tour of southern Illinois and
Missouri.
   Dukakis' meeting with farmers at the Reeds' home was being
broadcast on a hookup to 20 states via satellite cable television.
   The states were Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee,
Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
   The Massachusetts governor's aides said he has requested a
half-hour of air time on each broadcast network the night before
the Nov. 8 election.
   Dukakis said he was making the bus tour to show ``how much I
care about family farms and how little George Bush cares about
family farms.''
   He said Bush's philosophy was ``the fewer farms the better.''
   Dukakis said he also was concerned about the decline of other
facilities in rural areas, particularly hospitals.
   He was asked to comment on an interview with Willie Horton Jr.,
the Massachusetts prisoner who escaped from a furlough in 1986 and
slashed a Maryland man and raped his fiancee last year.
   Horton, now imprisoned in Maryland, was asked whom he'd support
for president.
   ``Obviously I'm for Gov. Dukakis,'' Horton was quoted as saying.
   ``He can't vote,'' commented Dukakis.
   Before arriving at the Reed farm, Dukakis' bus went through the
tiny town of Plainville, where people stood by the side of the road
holding up ``Dukakis for President'' signs.
   The candidate opened the bus window, leaned out, waved and said,
``Thank you all very much, thank you.''
   The campaign swing through rural areas marked a shift from the
previous two days when Dukakis visited factories, schools and a
bowling alley in Ohio and Michigan.
   ``George Bush was against the minimum wage; he was against the
plant closing law,'' Dukakis told workers Tuesday at McLouth Steel
Products, an employee-owned firm on the outskirts of Detroit.
   The firm's motto is ``The Future Is in Our Hands,'' a fact
Dukakis noted when he told the workers ``that's exactly what the
election is about.''
   For two days, in urban areas, Dukakis drew a distinction between
himself and Bush that he summed up this way:
   ``George Bush cares about the people on Easy Street. I care
about the people on Main Street. He's on their side. I'm on your
side.''
   He said his GOP rival has ``no convictions, no ideas, no plans.''
   The Massachusetts governor blamed the Republican administration
for the economic problems of the Midwest and for the nation's trade
deficit which he pledged to end within his first four years in
office.
   During the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Bush
was beaten badly in Iowa, South Dakota and Minnesota.
   But the man who defeated Bush in the those contests was Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole, whose Midwest roots and involvement in agricultural
policy in the Senate made him a formidable candidate in the region.
   Iowa remains a state in which the Democrats have high hopes. The
same is true of Minnesota.
   The states Dukakis was visiting today were key battlegrounds in
the battle for an electoral majority.
   Illinois is one of the big prizes with 24 electoral votes.
Democrats normally depend on huge majorities from the Chicago area
to overcome Republican majorities from the state's rural areas.
   Dukakis hopes to cut into that Republican bloc with his pledge
to create a presidential council on rural development and to target
$100 million to finance projects to help rural businesses.
   With 11 electoral votes, Missouri is one of the largest of the
border states.

   House Speaker Jim Wright said today he favors
passage of legislation this session that would apply the first-ever
lobbying restrictions to former members of Congress and
ex-congressional staffers.
   Both houses have approved different versions of the legislation,
which also would strengthen current lobbying restrictions against
those who leave the executive branch of government.
   The Senate took the latest action Tuesday night with voice vote
passage of lobbying legislation that modified an earlier Senate
bill.
   Wright told reporters he has asked House Judiciary Committee
members to work with senators to fashion a final compromise, and
approve the legislation before congressional adjournment.
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J.,
and other influential House members have been skeptical about the
legislation, arguing there was no evidence of unethical lobbying by
ex-members of Congress.
   But despite such reservations, the House passed its own version
of the bill by a vote of 374-19 on Oct. 12. The House bill was a
somewhat watered-down version of a bill the Senate passed earlier
this session.
   The bill passed Tuesday was the Senate's effort to meet the
House halfway, and House members would have to accept the modified
version for the bill to go to President Reagan.
   Major provisions of the Senate bill would:
   _Bar members of Congress from lobbying either chamber of
Congress for one year and restrict high-level executive branch
officials from lobbying their branch for one year.
   _Prohibit top congressional staffers from lobbying their own
member or the member's personal staff for one year, and prevent,
for the same period, top committee staff from lobbying the
committee's members or staff.
   _Provide a one-year moratorium during which Cabinet members,
their principal deputies, members of Congress, and top White House
aides could not lobby or work for a foreign entity after leaving
government service.
   The legislation would maintain the lifetime ban in current law
that prevents executive branch employees from lobbying on any issue
in which they had a ``personal and substantial'' involvement while
in government service.
   Maximum criminal penalties in the measure include $250,000 in
fines and four-year prison terms. The measure also provides for
recovery of civil fines of up to $50,000 or the amount of proceeds
obtained by an individual who violates restrictions in the measure.
   The legislation would become effective nine months after
becoming law.
   The House bill's restrictions on former members of Congress and
their staff would apply only to the chamber where they served. The
Senate restriction would apply to contacts in either house.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the chief sponsor, said the bill
would ``prevent those who are employed by the federal government
from leaving public service and marketing their access and
influence for financial gain.
   ``In addition, the legislation prevents federal employees from
vending sensitive information vital to national interests to
foreign entities for profit,'' he said.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Americans are tired of
influence-peddling and of Congress exempting itself from lobbying
restrictions.

   George Bush said today the White House and Congress should
extend ``the hand of partnership'' on foreign policy as he pointed
a finger at Michael Dukakis' lack of experience in world affairs.
The Democratic nominee, wooing rural voters, said the Republicans
prefer corporate operators to family farmers.
   Bush insisted he will ``fight like we're 10 points back''
although public opinion surveys indicate a lead of that margin _
not a deficit. The Dukakis campaign requested 30 minutes of paid
time on the television networks for an election-eve plea for
support.
   In Dearborn, Mich., the Republican nominee said the president
and Congress should ``extend to each other the hand of partnership,
not the finger of blame.'' He couldn't resist a shot at his rival,
saying Dukakis' shortage of foreign policy experience has given him
``a rather unrealistic view of American's role and the way in which
we lead.''
   Dukakis ``apparently believes that the Soviet economic problems
have left them too weak to make trouble,'' Bush said. ``The liberal
Massachusetts governor seems to think that all we need to do is
offer Moscow economic inducements and a less agressive, less
threatening Soviet Union will be the result.
   ``He's wrong.''
   Dukakis scorned Reagan-Bush administration agricultural policies
en route to a farm rally in Illinois. ``I don't remember any time
in this campaign he's expressed any concern about family farmers.
They (the Republicans) like corporate operators,'' he said.
   Dukakis' ticket-mate, Lloyd Bentsen, accused the Republicans
today of lowering the presidential race ``to the level of a
mud-wrestling'' contest.
   ``They have viciously slandered the patriotism and record of
Michael Dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness and
light,'' he said in Palo Alto, Calif.
   President Reagan continued to depict the Democrats as out of
touch. ``Where they want to take America, America doesn't want to
go,'' Reagan said in Columbus, Ohio.
   The map of today's campaigning looked like a strategy paper on
key battleground states. Michigan, Illinois, California and Ohio
hold 114 electoral votes among them, a hefty chunk of the 270
needed for election.
   A Harris poll released today put the Bush-Dukakis gap nationwide
at nine percentage points, with Bush ahead by 53 percent to 44
percent. The survey, done Friday through Monday among 1,356 likely
voters, had a margin of error of plus or minus three points. A
Harris poll just a week ago indicated a race too close to call.
   On Tuesday, Dukakis promised to erase the nation's $150 billion
trade deficit in four years. He also portrayed the election as a
choice between a candidate for the wealthy and a nominee who is
committed to working class Americans.
   ``George Bush cares about the people on Easy Street. I care
about the people on Main Street. He's on their side. I'm on your
side,'' he said in Kalimazoo, Mich.
   Dukakis also accused the Republican administration of failing to
halt the growing trade deficit and doing nothing to solve the
problems that led to the 1987 stock market crash, which occurred
one year ago today.
   The vice president, who traveled to Fulton, Mo., site of former
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famed ``Iron Curtain''
speech, focused on U.S.-Soviet relations in his address at
Westminister College.
   But in opening remarks to the students and comments to
reporters, Bush sought to convince listeners he doesn't have the
presidential election in hand.
   ``The worst thing to do would be to show a complacency I don't
feel or an overconfidence that I do not feel,'' said the GOP
nominee, who led by 17 points over in this week's NBC News-Wall
Street Journal poll.
   Bensten, who has hinted at dissatisfaction with his running
mate's limited response to GOP attacks, accused the Republican
ticket of a ``vicious campaign that violates the public trust.''
   ``They've said things about Mike Dukakis that in Texas we
wouldn't say about a rattlesnake on a lawn at a church picnic,''
Bentsen told about 2,000 students at the University of California
at Los Angeles.
   For his part, Dukakis lashed out at Bush, charging that his
rival has ``no convictions, no ideas, no plans.''
   ``We've got to end the Republican rainbow coalition of red ink
for our children, pink slips for our workers, greenmail for sharp
operators on Wall Street and golden parachutes for top corporate
executives,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor said his solution to the trade
deficit would be to reduce the budget deficit, increase foreign
trade, invest in education and training and place a greater
emphasis on research and development.
   While the candidate stepped up the offensive on the campaign
trail, Dukakis' ad chief said the campaign is releasing a network
television ad today criticizing Bush's plan to make Quayle the
nation's drug czar.
   ``If George Bush couldn't handle the job, how do you think Dan
Quayle is gonna do?'' the ad asks.
   The vice president, expanding on his own campaign ad suggesting
that only the Republican nomine is experienced enough to negotiate
with the Soviets, told the Fulton audience he would remain wary of
Soviet intentions despite the reforms instituted under the
leadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the
Soviet Union,'' Bush said.
   Questioned about his claim that he will ``campaign like an
underdog,'' Bush said that his staff ``will not lighten up. We're
going to stay right down to the wire. ... If I find anybody letting
up in my campaign, they're history.''
   Quayle also was warning against overconfidence, but was upbeat
after greeting cheering college students in Illinois.
   ``I'm beginning to feel what it's going to be like on election
night,'' Quayle said.

   Drums pounded a trance-like beat
Wednesday night, the smell of incense filled the air, and temple
priest Gan Chai Heng cleared his mind of worldly thoughts.
   Then, he and eight other priests led 200 barefoot Chinese
devotees in a calm walk over a 30-foot bed of burning coals so hot
that the 10,000 spectators had to watch from 50 feet away.
   The firewalking ceremony in front of the Temple of the Southern
Heaven capped the nine-day Festival of the Nine Emperor Gods.
   Temple worker Wong Choong Bun, 49, one of those who walked
unflinchingly over the red-hot coals, said he felt no pain and it
was an act of faith in the gods to ensure good luck.
   ``I walk to ensure a good life and for the well-being of my
family and friends,'' Wong said.
   Some carried a statue of the gods with them as they walked over
the 4{-foot-wide and 1{-foot-thick bed of coals on wooden platforms
mounted on horizontal poles. Others carried images of gods and
incense sticks in their hands.
   ``We have used several thousand pounds of charcoal for the fire
and we began making the fire four hours before the firewalking to
ensure that it was really hot,'' said Yap Kok Chan, deputy
secretary of the temple.
   The firewalkers, all men, wore loose-fitting white trousers and
long-sleeved shirts, and scarves on their heads. ``We never allow
women to walk on the fire,'' Gan said, although they may join in on
the fasting.
   Gan, who has walked on the coals for more than 10 years, said
it's not difficult and added: ``All I have to do is to adhere to a
vegetarian diet and clear my mind of worldy thoughts.''
   The firewalkers usually eat one vegetarian meal a day during the
nine-day fasting period, although there are some who take only
liquid nourishment. Mostly, they pray and meditate, and must
abstain from sex.
   According to legend, a Manchu emperor many centuries ago
beheaded nine gods who helped the people to rebel against his
oppression. The emperor later regretted his actions and prayed.
   After an epidemic swept through the region in 1940, residents
prayed to the statue of the Nine Emperor Gods, practiced
vegetarianism for nine days, and started walking on the coals.
   Now the Chinese here, especially those who practice Taoism, come
for the annual festival, walk on the coals, and pray and give alms
to atone for their sins. Buddhists, Confucionists and other Chinese
also participate.
   Western scientists say that firewalkers usually avoid injury by
walking across the coals with moist feet so that a thin layer of
steam protects the flesh.
   ``It could be faith and some hypnosis,'' said physician
Ampikaipahan Kandiah. ``But there have been some cases reported
where people's feet have been burned during firewalking. We have
treated them. They put it dwn to lack of proper fasting.''
   Gan said that over the years, he has seen a few people with
slight burns on their feet. Yap said those with burned feet never
admit it or show it because they are ashamed that people might
think they were impure or had not fasted properly. No one
complained Wednesday night.

   Scientists from Alaska and the Soviet frontier
town of Magadan will examine how people adapt to harsh conditions
in the far north, one of the participants said Wednesday.
   Alaska medical students, nurses, biologists and environmental
scientists will work with their counterparts in Magadan and
surrounding villages for three weeks next May, said Dr. Ted Mala,
director of the Institute for Circumpolar Health Studies at the
University of Alaska-Anchorage.
   ``We plan to bring in sleeping bags and work side by side,''
with local physician's assistants and scientists from the Institute
for Biological Problems of the North in Magadan, Mala said.
   The group will examine disease patterns, psychological problems
and medical anthropology, including the drug and alcohol abuse,
Mala said.
   Two groups of 10 Soviets specialists will travel to Alaska for
similar studies next September and October, Mala said.
   ``It will be interesting to see what has happened on both sides
with the difference in diets,'' Mala said, especially since the
natives of Alaska are related to the indigenous population of the
Soviet Union just across the Bering Strait.
   The agreement was signed Aug. 15, but Mala noted that none of
the group had been anywhere near a telephone since then.

   The Chilean air force is close to signing a

Defense Weekly reported Wednesday.
   After a year of negotiation with Israel Aircraft Industries,
only the credit terms remain to be settled, the military affairs
journal said.
   It said the Chileans were being offered a ``sanitized'' version
powered by a SNECMA Atar 9K-50 engine, rather than the U.S.-made
General Electric engine, manufactured in Israel under license,
whose sale to Chile is embargoed by the U.S. government.
   Chile wants 18 fighters and two trainers to replace its
interceptor force of Northrop F-5s, for which it has had
difficulties obtaining spare parts, Jane's said.

   A rocket fired by Moslem guerrillas
today killed nine people and injured 17 who were waiting outside
Kabul airport to catch a flight bound for Tashkent and Moscow, a
security officer said.
   Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad, Pakistan, said the
attack killed at least 15 civilians and caused Soviet-Afghan
military aircraft to scramble. Radio Kabul said nine were killed
and 18 injured.
   An officer of Sarandoy, an Afghan paramilitary force entrusted
with airport security, said nine people, including two Soviet women
and a Soviet girl, were killed. The other people killed were
Afghans, he said on condition of anonymity. One of the injured was
a Soviet citizen, and the rest were Afghans, he added. All 26
people were waiting in a tent outside the airport.
   The rocket was one of 21 that hit the airport grounds between
9:25 a.m. and 3 p.m., the officer said. No one was injured by the
other rockets, but some windows were broken in airport buildings.
   Tass, the Soviet news agency, said about 60 surface-to-surface
missiles were fired into the capital.
   The Sarandoy officer said some of the rockets landed in areas of
the airport used by Soviet troops but he could not give any details.
   All civilian flights out of the airport were canceled for the
remainder of today and for Thursday, he said.
   Afghan and Soviet forces, who base helicopters and transport
planes at the same airport, continued to take off and land after
the rocket attacks.
   A Western diplomatic source said two fighter-bombers, four
helicopter gunships and one transport plane were seen taking off
after immediately after the barrage started.
   The security officer said the rocket that killed the Soviets and
Afghans landed at 1 p.m. just outside the last of several gates
barring access to the airport terminal. The dead and wounded were
among about 40 people waiting inside the tent.
   Four hours after the attack, large bloodstains marked the
sidewalk in front of the tent, and small puddles of water were
bright red.
   The tent was blown off its pegs, the canvas pitted with shrapnel
holes. Wooden and metal chairs lay in a tangled heap.
   The debris included the body of a fluffy, black and yellow cat,
a wristwatch strap and torn plastic handles from tote bags.
   A workman scraped gravel over the pools of blood.
   The Sarandoy officer was unable to say how big a rocket struck
the tent or how far it had been fired from. According to Western
diplomats, the Moslem guerrillas fighting Soviet and Afghan troops
use rockets as big as 107mm and 122mm, which have a range of nine
to 13 miles.
   Today's attack was the largest on the airport since the first
week of September when guerrillas rockets destroyed eight Sukhoi
ground attack jets. The number of human casualties in that attack
was not known.

<HEAD>Government Bans Broadcast Interviews With IRA Members, Militant
Protestants</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 9th pvs, `Roy Hattersley...' to CORRECT quote.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today banned broadcast interviews
with members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, its legal
political wing, Sinn Fein, and Northern Ireland's militant
Protestant groups.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd announced the immediate ban in the
House of Commons and said the Conservative government aimed to deny
terrorists publicity.
   The ban, which also applies to any statements supporting the
organizations, provoked immediate outcry from opposition parties
and civil liberty groups that denounced it as futile and a
violation of free speech.
   Hurd, who is responsible for broadcasting, told Parliament:
``This is not a restriction on reporting. It is a restriction on
direct appearances by those who use or support violence.''
   He said it brought radio and TV into line with print media,
which are not affected by the ban, in that broadcasters remain free
to report the content of statements by pro-violence groups.
   The broadcast ban was done by decree. Such a restriction on the
press would require legislation.
   The ban forbids broadcasting interviews with members of the
legal Ulster Defense Association, the umbrella group for militant
Protestant organizations, as well as the mainly Roman Catholic IRA
and Sinn Fein and all other outlawed groups.
   The ban on supporters prompted questions in Parliament, since it
could apply to other legal organizations sympathetic to the IRA's
goal of driving Britain out of Northern Ireland by force.
   Roy Hattersley, Labor Party deputy leader, called the measure
``trivial, worthless and almost certainly counterproductive'' and
said it made ``the government look simultaneously repressive and
ridiculous.''
   ``Have you considered the damaging ways in which this will be
used both at home and abroad, particularly in the United States, to
portray this government as the enemy of free expression?''
Hattersley said.
   Hugh Dykes of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
Party said the ban would be ``a very great mistake'' because ``it
would look as if the government fears the IRA can persuade people
of their sick cause.''
   The ban applies to the publicly funded British Broadcasting
Corp. and the commercial Independent Broadcasting Authority, but
not to foreign broadcasting organizations.
   It also will not apply to proceedings in Parliament and will be
eased during election campaigns when all parties are supposed to
get equal coverage from the broadcast media, said Hurd.
   The ban, imposed under existing broadcasting laws, closely
follows a 15-year ban in the Irish Republic on interviews with the
IRA, Sinn Fein and Protestant groups that espouse violent tactics.
   A government source said Mrs. Thatcher decided on the ban as
part of a package of security measures after an upsurge in IRA
activity, including a bomb that killed eight British soldiers in
Northern Ireland two months ago.
   It was the first time such actions have been taken since the
mid-1950s, when similar powers were used against splinter Welsh and
Scottish nationalist groups.
   The BBC and Independent Broadcasting Authority refused comment
on the ban.
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, a member of Parliament, called
the ban ``nonsense'' and said: ``This draconian measure is not an
attack on the IRA or the ability of the IRA to operate. It is a
direct attack on Sinn Fein because our views are unacceptable to
the British government.''
   Sarah Spencer, general secretary of the National Council for
Civil Liberties, said the ban would ``serve only to prevent the
public understanding the motives which lie behind the violence and
thereby hinder the search for a political solution to the
conflict.''
   A Sinn Fein statement said:
   ``If we were in eastern Europe the British government would be
crying foul at the banning from TV and radio of a legal political
party that has parliamentary representation and a mandate from its
community.''
   Sinn Fein commands about one-third of the minority Catholic vote
in Northern Ireland and has about 60 representatives on local
councils who stand to lose access to radio and TV.

   Three anti-apartheid activists
who escaped from custody and fled to the U.S. Consulate five weeks
ago emerged Wednesday and pledged to resume their opposition to the
government.
   South African authorities say they won't arrest the three, who
had been jailed without charge for more a year before they slipped
away from police guards and fled to the consulate Sept. 13.
   The activists _ all senior officials of banned anti-apartheid
organizations _ spent the next 36 nights in a consular meeting room
on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office building.
   The three said they had little faith in the government's promise
not to act against them.
   ``Our experience with the government is that we must be very
cautious and not accept anything at face vale,'' said Murphy Morobe.
   But they added they were influenced to leave their sanctuary on
the advice of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela.
   ``The view of comrade Nelson Mandela was that we should leave
the consulate as soon as possible, and that assisted us in our
decision,'' said Mohammed Valli Moosa.
   Mandela's message was relayed to the men via his wife, Winnie.
The couple met Saturday at the Cape Town clinic where Mandela is
recuperating from tuberculosis.
   ``We entered the U.S. Consulate not simply to secure our own
freedom, but to stir the conscience of South Africa and the
international community about the plight of our fellow detainees,''
said Valli Moosa.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge
during the 28-month-old state of emergency. About 1,000 are
believed in detention.
   The three smiled broadly as they embraced their families and
colleagues waiting for them in the lobby of the building. Scores of
journalists and about 200 supporters also were present.
   The activists gave clenched-fist salutes to the cheering crowd,
mostly young blacks who chanted ``Amandla,'' the Zulu word for
``power.''
   Riot police, armed with truncheons and shotguns, sought to keep
the crowd under control and police camera crews photographed the
event.
   ``It's great to be out of here,'' said the third activist, Vusi
Khanyile.
   Valli Moosa and Morobe are senior leaders of the United
Democratic Front, and Khanyile is chairman of the National
Education Crisis Committee. Morobe and Khanyile are black, Valli
Moosa is Indian.
   The front is the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition. The
crisis committee was formed to seek greater black control over
education policies.
   The activists later held a news conference at the nearby
University of the Witwatersrand. Before it began, a television crew
from the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. was subjected
to jeers from the crowd and left at the request of organizers.
   The three men said they would resume their anti-apartheid
activities although they declined to give specifics.
   ``We would like to continue as before, but obviously there are
major constraints,'' said Morobe. ``Our major concern is for other
colleagues in detention.''
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in 1987 after
going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June 12,
1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in 1986.
   They escaped while undergoing physiotherapy at a Johannesburg
hospital.
   Before his detention, Morobe operated from underground as chief
spokesman for the United Democratic Front. One of the UDF's most
eloquent speakers and writers, he played a key role in coveying its
positions at a time when most of its leadership was in jail or in
hiding.
   The activists said they had cordial relations with the U.S.
Consulate staff but were never offered a meeting with U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins.
   ``We would like to interpret it as a snub ... but there may have
been other reasons,'' said Morobe. He said the three did not
request a meeting with Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador in
South Africa.
   In February, the government banned the front and other major
anti-apartheid groups from functioning.
   It is unclear whether the government will allow them to promote
the front's positions freely or whether they will be restricted
again.
   ``We hope the government will react differently this time,''
said Morobe. ``We are eternal optimists.''
   The U.S. Embassy said in a statement: ``The U.S. government did
not negotiate and was not involved in their decision to leave ...
They arrived at their decision after consultations with their
families and advisers.''
   South African officials did not issue a statement.

   ``David is a good friend,'' Haley said. ``I wanted to get him to

romantic on stage without some sugar.''
   The 53-year-old operatic heavyweight shared some of his diet
secrets in a New York Times interview, although one he kept to
himself was his current poundage. He said he adheres to an 1,800
calories-a-day regimen that is high in salads and lean protein like
chicken and veal.
   Asked to describe a typical day before a performance, he said:
``At 11:45 I make a little veal with vegetables. Then at 3:45 I
have a piece of prosciutto. Then at 4:45 a second prosciutto with
bread; you need some sugar when you sing. You need the energy.''
   Pavarotti, who is currently performing at the Metropolitan
Opera, said one of his favorite dishes is pasta with butter and
melted blue cheese. ``You know that it has two million five hundred
calories a spoonful,'' he said wistfully.

   Sukhreet Gabel, the key witness in the bribery
trial of former Miss America Bess Myerson, predicted Wednesday
she'd enjoy 15 minutes of fame _ during a 25-minute appearance on a

   ``I'm very conscious of the fact that I'm not really a

   It was the latest bit of exposure for Ms. Gabel, whose hiring by

   A local radio personality has offered Ms. Gabel a job as a

   ``I found the guy in the panty hose pretty funny,'' she said.
   Despite the rash of attention, Ms. Gabel described herself as

   North Korea today proposed creating a new
nation out of North and South Korea, with a shared military command
and a national assembly comprised of an equal number of
representatives from each side.
   The North's deputy foreign minister, Kang Sok Ju, suggested the
new nation would be called the Democratic Confederal Republic of
Koryo.
   Kang told the General Assembly that ``there is no hidden attempt
to insinuate `unification through communization' and no intention
to impose our ideas and system on the other side.''
   He said peaceful reunification is possible if each side respects
the other's ideology and that the new state would retain the
separate social systems of the communist North and pro-Western
South.
   South Korea's U.N. Mission said in a statement, ``We think the
North Korean delegation's speech this morning appears to be a
compilation of their past proposals. Our president yesterday
(Tuesday) suggested all those proposals of North and South Korea be
discussed at the sumit talks between the two parts of Korea.''
   South Korea's president, Roh Tae-woo, addressed the Assembly on
Tuesday.
   The authorities of ``Koryo'' would found and run joint companies
and common markets and encourage the formation of a new national
economy for the entire peninsula, said Kang.
   A unified Korea would ``not only leave intact the capital
invested by other nations in South Korea prior to reunification and
continue to ensure their concessions, but also promote new
investments of foreign capital,'' said Kang.
   ``Koryo'' would have a unified military command, abolish former
military alliances and treaties, and dissolve the demarcation line
dividing North and South, he said.
   The new nation would be the sole representative of the peninsula
in diplomatic relations with other nations and would hold one seat
in the United Nations, he added.
   Both Koreas currently hold non-voting observer status in the
General Assembly.
   ``Koryo'' would be a neutral, non-aligned nation, and the
peninsula would become a nuclear-weapon-free zone and ban the
presence of foreign troops, Kang said.
   About 42,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea.
   Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
called it a ``thoughtful speech and interesting speech.''
   ``I don't think there were any new elements except the tone; the
tone was considerably more conciliatory,'' said Walters.
   On Tuesday, Roh proposed a summit between the leaders of North
and South and the signing of a non-aggression pact by the bitter
rivals.
   Roh said a summit with North Korea's President Kim Il-sung would
``resolve all the problems raised by either or both sides with
regard to disarmament, arms control and other military matters.''
   Roh also pledged that ``the Republic of Korea will never use
force first against the North.''
   Kang agreed with Roh that a summit would have to adopt a
non-aggression pact, but he said the summit also would have to
cover the issue of reunification.
   If the South is not ready to discuss reunificaton, said Kang,
senior officials could at least meet to hold talks aimed at easing
military tensions as a step toward eventual ``top level talks.''
   He also said the United States and North Korea should sign a
peace agreement that would result in the withdrawal of U.S. troops
from the South, a phased demilitarization of the peninsula, and the
estabishment of a nuclear-free zone.
   Roh also proposed the two Koreas meet with United States, Soviet
Union, China and Japan to prepare the groundwork for peace and
security measures throughout northeast Asia. He did not offer
specifics.
   Allies of the United States and South Korea should ``contribute
to the progress and opening of North Korea by engaging Pyongyang in
expanding relations,'' the president told the 159-member world body.
   Relations between North Korea and the United States never have
gone beyond the symbolic since 1945, when the Korean peninsula was
divided between North and South Korea.
   The Koreas hold U.N. non-voting observer status because they
still technically are at war. The 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an
armistice and no peace treaty was signed.
   On Thursday, Roh meets President Reagan in Washington. The South
Korean leader is expected to ask Washington to improve its
relations with North Korea.

   The Associated Press Managing Editors association
presented its 1988 Freedom of Information award Wednesday to The
Review Times of Fostoria, Ohio, for efforts that eventually led to
an overhaul of Ohio's public records law.
   The 18th annual award was presented at the APME convention here
by Earl Maucker, managing editor of the Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) News
and Sun-Sentinel, chairman of the APME FOI committee.
   The Fostoria daily was honored for its efforts to gain access to
non-patient records of a community hospital association, a project
that involved lengthy court battles and ultimately legislative
action to revamp and restore Ohio's public records law.
   Citations were awarded to five other newspapers for
extraordinary effort toward a better-informed citizenry. They were
signed by Maucker and APME president Robert H. Giles, executive
editor of the Detroit News, and presented to:
   _The State of Columbia, S.C., for its pioneering application of
the state FOI law in an investigative series on the University of
South Carolina's refusal to disclose records of drug tests required
for scholarship athletes.
   _The Dallas Morning News, for a six-month investigation and
two-part series exposing how the judiciary in Texas excluded itself
from federal and state open records and meetings laws, allowing
judges to operate outside public scrutiny.
   _The Miami News, for accomplishments including preserving the
right of the news media to conduct voter exit polls, winning
release of documents sealed in a local murder case, the application
of FOI in exposing flaws in a bail-bond system, and the use of FOI
to document the wealth of the Archdiocese of Miami.
   _The San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News for its investigative series
exposing a behind-the-scenes relationship between the Fair
Political Practices Commission in California and the politicians it
was supposed to monitor.
   _The Turlock (Calif.) Journal for its legal battles and efforts
in reporting and educating the public during a confrontation
between the newspaper and police department over access to
documents vital to public concern.

   A man convicted of shooting at his
estranged wife from ambush was sentenced to 8 to 16 years in prison.
   Sentence was imposed Tuesday on Timothy Garland, 40, of Bolivar
by Westmoreland County Common Pleas Court Judge Donetta Ambrose.
   Authorities said in March 1987, Garland took a handful of
shells, a high-powered rifle with a telescopic sight, a pistol, his
last unemployment check, and a Bible to a rural road and waited for
his wife, Cynthia, 33, to drive by on her way to work.
   After he opened fire with the hunting rifle, the woman's car
stalled and she flagged down another motorist, Robert Barnhart,
authorities said.
   During the trial, she testified Garland continued to fire while
she tried to hide underneath the dashboard of Barnhart's truck. She
was unhurt, but Barnhart's dog was killed.
   A jury last November found Garland guilty of attempted homicide,
two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of recklessly
endangering another person.
   Garland's wife has since divorced him and goes by another name.

<TEXT>
   South Korea will call on the United
States to improve relations with communist North Korea in
conjunction with similar moves by the Soviet Union and its allies
to thaw ties with Seoul, officials said.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, to meet Thursday at the
White House with President Reagan, ``will formally urge the United
States to take broad measures as soon as possible to improve ties
with North Korea,'' one government official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Roh will
brief Reagan on his new peace initiatives on the Korean peninsula
and thank him for Washington's support for a successful hosting of
the Seoul Olympics.
   The United States beefed up its military presence in and around
the Korean peninsula during the Seoul Olympics and warned North
Korea against disrupting the Games, which Pyongyang unsuccessfully
sought to co-host. The Games ended without incident on Oct. 2.
   In a related development, North Korea today proposed creating a
new nation out of North and South Korea, with a shared military
command and a national assembly comprised of an equal number of
representatives from each side.
   The North's deputy foreign minister, Kang Sok Ju, suggested the
new nation would be called the Democratic Confederal Republic of
Koryo and would allow the separate social systems of North and
South to remain in tact.
   His proposal came one day after Roh called for a summit meeting
with North Korea's president to sign a non-aggression pact. North
Korea and South Korea have been bitter enemies since the division
of the Korean peninsula in 1945.
   Relations between the United States and North Korea have never
developed beyond the symbolic stage. The United States fought for
South Korea in a three-year war against the North Koreans in the
early 1950s.
   As a conciliatory gesture, the United States allowed limited
contact with North Korea in early 1987 but revoked the decision
last year after the communist Asian state was implicated in the
November bombing of a South Korean commercial jet with 115 people
on board near Burma.
   South Korea, the official said, now hopes the United States will
change its policy again, easing visa restrictions and allowing
limited personnel and trade contacts with North Korea.
   Such conciliatory U.S. gestures are necessary to bolster Roh's
initiatives to improve relations with North Korea, the official
said.
   Roh on Tuesday told the U.N. General Assembly that South Korea
is ready to end its rivalry and confrontation with North Korea and
would not oppose its allies improving ties with North Korea.
   ``It is our wish that our allies and friends will contribute to
the progress and opening of North Korea by engaging Pyongyang (the
North Korean capital) in expanding relations,'' he said.
   ``It is also our position that those socialist countries with
close ties to North Korea continue to maintain positive relations
and cooperate with North Korea even as they improve relations with
us,'' Roh added.
   It is unclear how far South Korea wants the United States to go
to improve ties with North Korea, but the official said, ``We want
the policies of our allies commensurate with moves by countries
allied with the north.''
   South Korea, bolstered by a remarkable economic revival in the
last two decades, is actively pushing to improve ties with
communist nations. Hungary and Yugoslavia have already set up trade
offices in Seoul and the Soviet Union and other major communist
nations are expected to follow suit.
   A few days before the Summer Olympics opened in Seoul last
month, Hungary made the surprise announcement that it would become
the first communist nation to establish ambassadorial-level
relations with South Korea.
   Other topics expected to be discussed at the Reagan-Roh meeting
include Washington's growing trade deficit with South Korea _ $9.5
billion last year, expected to swell to $12 billion this year, the
official said.
   Roh is expected to assure Reagan that South Korea would take
further moves to open its market, preferably to the United States,
he said.

<HEAD>Gov. Andrus Bans Further Shipments Of Radioactive Waste Into Idaho</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Cecil Andrus today banned further
shipments of low-level radioactive waste into Idaho until the
federal government opens a permanent repository for that waste.
   ``Any of this waste will be stopped at the border,'' Andrus
declared, accusing the government of welching on two promises to
begin moving millions of cubic feet of temporarily stored waste out
of the state.
   Andrus notified Energy Secretary John Herrington of the ban
after returning from a one-day tour of the government's proposed
Waste Isolation Pilot Project repository in New Mexico.
   That facility in the desert near Carlsbad was to open this month
as the permanent repository for more then 2 million cubic feet of
radioactive waste, brought into Idaho and now stored above ground
at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, a research and
training facility run by the Energy Department.
   The opening, however, has been postponed until at least early
next year because of questions raised about its long-range safety.
After his tour, the governor said Energy Department officials could
give him no firm date on when the site might open.
   ``It's an outstanding facility,'' Andrus said. ``It appears to
be well engineered. ... If radioactive waste can be stored safely
any place in the world, this is it.
   ``No more radioactive waste will be accepted in Idaho from any
location outside this state until they have a location where this
waste will be stored,'' he said.
   The temporarily stored waste at INEL has built up over the past
several decades, but the bulk of it has been shipped in recent
years from the federal facility at Rocky Flats, Colo.
   The government delayed opening the $800 million repository in
salt corridors some 2,000 feet below ground in New Mexico because
of safety concerns raised by some Energy Department engineers and
because of a congressional dispute over putting the site under
Energy Department control.
   Andrus discounted the questions of safety and called on
Herrington to begin proceedings to gain control of the land so the
repository can be opened.
   ``Promises have come and promises have gone,'' he said.
``Promises from DOE are no longer good. ... We're tired, and we're
not going to do it.''
   Andrus acknowledged that he could be legally challenged in
closing the borders to radioactive waste imports. But, he added,
``I'm confident that DOE is not going to bring material into the
state when we have said we don't want it.''
   The state already requires truckers of hazardous wastes to stop
at border checkpoints for safety and paperwork checks.

   The condition of Emperor Hirohito worsened
Wednesday as he coughed up blood for the first time since his
intestinal hemorrhaging began a month ago, Imperial Household
officials said.
   The 87-year-old monarch was resting after doctors gave him
transfusions of nearly 2 pints of blood that stablilized his
condition, they said.
   The emperor's daughter, Atsuko Ikeda, said he was awake but
hardly responded to her when she visited him, Kyodo News Service
said.
   Mrs. Ikeda told reporters her father coughed repeatedly during
the five-minute visit to his bedside in the Imperial Palace, the
report said.
   His temperature was 99.3, compared with his normal reading of
about 95.9, they said.
   The internal hemorrhaging began Sept 19. Since then, he has
received transfusions of more than twice the normal amount of blood
in his body.
   In recent days, Hirohito ate only a few spoonfuls of porridge
and doctors said he was losing strength because the intravenous
feedings cannot supply enough nutrition.
   Imperial officials have declined to confirm or deny news reports
that Hirohito has cancer in the area of his upper intestine.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government declared a state of
emergency and began evacuating coastal residents as Hurricane Joan
spun toward Central America after leaving a trail of devastation in
Colombia.
   At least 50 people were dead, injured or missing in Colombia and
tens of thousands of homes were destroyed or flooded, officials
said.
   Joan packed nearly 115 mph winds and puzzled forecasters with
its erratic course as it churned toward the Colombian island resort
of San Andres, 500 miles north of the Colombian coast.
   Manuel Obando, president of Costa Rica's National Emergency
Committee, predicted the brunt of the killer storm would hit Costa
Rica today.
   The government evacuated homeless elderly people and children
and 86 hospital patients from Puerto Limon, an Atlantic coast port
city of 8,000 people 105 miles southeast of the capital, San Jose,
Obando said.
   He said 167 inmates also were evacuated from a prison and that
authorities were prepared to move another 30,000 coastal residents
inland as sheets of rain lashed the coast.
   ``If by midday we observe that there is imminent danger, we'll
begin to evacuate,'' Obando said.
   Heavy rains pushed the Reventazon and Parritas rivers over their
banks near the Pacific coast port of Puntarenas, 80 miles northeast
of San Jose, radio reports said.
   In Panama, a hurricane watch was in effect for the north coast
from Punta San Blas to Boca del Toro, and for San Andres and the
east coast of Costa Rica. Weather forecasters said the storm was
moving west at 5 to 10 mph.
   Long lines formed at supermarkets and pharmacies in Panama City,
the capital, as people heeded warnings to stock up on supplies. The
government declared a state of alert.
   ``Stay calm, don't become alarmed and don't panic,'' Colon Mayor
Juan Fidel Macias told residents of that Atlantic port in a radio
broadcast.
   Traffic in the Panama Canal was not expected to be disrupted,
said Panama Canal Commission spokesman Franklin Castrellon.
   In Nicaragua, weather officials were uncertain what impact Joan
would have. A banner headline in the official Sandinista newspaper,
Barricada, read, ``Hurricane Nears The Coast.''
   At noon EDT, Joan's center was near latitude 11.4 north,
longitude 78.8 west, about 210 miles east-southeast of San Andres,
the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said in a
statement.
   Joan's unusual southern path had forecasters puzzling over its
possible landfall.
   ``Joan is one of a kind,'' said Jim Gross, a meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center. ``You just don't see many hurricanes
that take this course and hug the coast.''
   Joan raked the northern Colombian coast with heavy rains and
winds Monday, triggering floods that inundated and destroyed homes.
   In the northern town of Carmen de Bolivar, 360 miles north of
Bogota, the capital, at least three people were killed Monday and
about 38 were missing, Victor Leon Mendoza of the Bolivar state
government said.
   A child was killed and seven people injured Monday in the town
of Uribia on Colombia's Guajira Peninsula, police said in a
communique. About 75 percent of the homes in Uribia, a town of
45,000, were destroyed or flooded, police said.
   Camilo Cardenas, president of Colombia's National Emergency
Committee, said in a news release that about 200 homes in Carmen de
Bolivar were destroyed or flooded.
   Joan became the fifth hurricane of the Atlantic season when
maximum sustained winds reached 74 mph Monday and its center began
to become better defined, a sign the system could intensify over
open water into the western Caribbean, forecasters said.
   Gilbert, the most devastating hurricane in recent years, left
more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage
last month in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the Cayman Islands
and Mexico.

<DATELINE>MUENSTER, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Wednesday detained
a former pro-Nazi Latvian police commander who had faced
deportation from the United States for allegedly carrying out World
War II atrocities.
   Boleslav Maikovskis, 83, was being investigated ``in connection
with charges of murder and attempted murder,'' said Dortmund
prosecutor Klaus Schacht.
   Maikovskis, formerly of Mineola, N.Y., was picked up at his home
in Muenster because authorities believed he might try to flee West
Germany, said Schacht, a prosecutor in Dortmund's war crimes
investigation office.
   Maikovskis had applied for political asylum in West Germany
after fleeing the United States last year.
   Maikovskis is accused of World War II atrocities including
burning down a village and shooting women and chidren. The Soviet
Union in 1965 sentenced Maikovskis to death in absentia.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Tuesday
in Moscow that Maikovskis shot women and children and added that
the Soviet Union is ``ready to give all the necessary information''
to West Germany.
   Maikovskis had been living in New York since 1951. On Friday,
the U.S. Justice Department said he had fled the country, but it
could not say when.
   Schacht said investigators based their initial investigation on
evidence presented at another war crimes trial in West Germany in
1976 during which Maikovskis ``was mentioned several times.''
   He added his office would welcome any assistance from Moscow,
but declined to say whether Maikovskis eventually would be deported
to the Soviet Union.
   West Germany has a policy of refusing extradition requests from
nations that have the death penalty.
   The prosecutor declined to give further details about the
investigation, saying the prosecutors are still looking through 20
volumes of court records relating to the war crimes case in which
Maikovskis was mentioned.
   Schacht said authorities had determined that Maikovskis was
healthy enough to be held.
   He said Maikovskis entered the country on a passport issued by
the Latvian government in exile. The West German government
recognizes those documents and issued him a visa, Schacht said.
   On Tuesday, the Nuremberg-based federal office that oversees
political asylum requests said Maikovskis submitted a request
nearly a year ago and that a decision would be made by the end of
November.
   ``Normally the decision is made about a year after submission of
the asylum request,'' said spokesman Wolfgang Weickhardt.
   Maikovskis probably has been living in West Germany since
submitting the request in November 1987, Weickhardt said.
   ``He has most likely been in West Germany, because those seeking
political asylum are by law restricted from traveling,'' Weickhardt
said.
   He said Maikovskis could face a criminal trial in West Germany
even if he is granted political asylum.
   ``He could go to trial here. That is a different matter from
receiving political asylum,'' Weickhardt said.
   In order to be granted asylum, Maikovskis will have to convince
authorities that he is being politically persecuted elsewhere,
Weickhardt said.
   Maikovskis was a chief of a Nazi-created police force in Latvia
during World War II. He is accused of having ordered the mass
arrest of residents in the Latvian village of Audrini and then
burning the town. The 200 villagers later were killed by the Nazis.
   He is also suspected of taking part in operations that led to
the deaths of Latvian Jews, gypsies and resistance fighters.
   Deportation proceedings against Maikovskis began in the United
States in 1976 and dragged on through several appeals. His
deportation was upheld by a federal appeals court in 1985 and his
final appeal was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986.
   The U.S. Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations
on Friday said it had lost track of Maikovskis several months ago,
and had just discovered that he had left the country.

   An Army laboratory in Hawaii has identified
the remains of six U.S. servicemen missing from the Vietnam War,
including one man whose remains were removed from North Vietnam by
a refugee, the Pentagon said today.
   The six men _ four Air Force officers, a Navy officer and a
Marine officer _ were all aviators and were identified by the
Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu after being
repatriated to the United States in June and July.
   One of the six, identified as Air Force Maj. Robert C. Edmunds,
was returned to U.S. officials by a Vietnamese refugee who came
forward during interviews last June at a refugee camp in Malaysia,
said Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman.
   ``This is the first occurrence that we know of in which a
refugee from Vietnam has provided remains that proved to be from a
missing American,'' Schneider said.
   ``On three other occasions, however, Laotian nationals have
turned over remains that proved to be from Americans missing in
Laos.''
   The remaining five sets of remains were among a group of 25
repatriated by the Vietnamese government on July 13. The five
identified today are the first from that group of 25 to be
identified.
   ``The remains will depart Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii with a
full military honors ceremony on Thursday and travel to Travis Air
Force Base, Calif., for their final journey home,'' the Pentagon
added in a statement.
   The Pentagon identified the missing servicemen as:

   With the latest identifications, 2,387 Americans continue to be
listed as missing in Indochina as a result of the Vietnam war, of
whom 1,751 are listed as missing in either North or South Vietnam.
   All told, the remains of 168 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the
laboratory since the end of the war.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the cooperation of the
Vietnamese that resulted in the accounting for these Americans and
hopes that such unilateral turnovers of information and remains
will continue along with the joint investigative efforts begun in
September 1988,'' the Pentagon said in its statement.

   Federal officials said Newsome, who retrieved the condoms from a
wire trap installed in the sewer system by another inmate, was paid
in marijuana for his part in the plan.
   Prosecutors said that on a prearranged date, a visitor to the
correctional center would carry marijuana into the prison concealed
in condoms. Visitors are not searched because they remain isolated
from inmates.
   The visitor would enter the rest room and flush the condoms down
the toilet.
   Newsome would then enter a manhole leading into the pipe and
retrieved the marijuana.
   The indictment says Newsome distributed the marijuana to other
inmates.
   Conviction could mean 10 years in prison and fines of up to
$500,000.

   Shops were closed and transportation came to a
standstill today during a general strike in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Hospital officials said three Palestinians were wounded in
clashes with soldiers.
   About 50 buses filled with supporters of the right-wing Likud
bloc headed into the Gaza Strip to show support for Israeli
occupation of the area seized from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Arab reports said the army imposed curfews in refugee camps,
towns and neighborhoods throughout Gaza, confining about 210,000
Palestinians to their homes.
   The fundamentalist Moslem Hamas movement, a main force in Gaza,
distributed leaflets Tuesday night urging Arabs in the seaside
strip to obey calls to strike today, the Israeli Itim news agency
reported.
   The strike call followed a violent clash Tuesday in the West
Bank city of Nablus, where Israeli soldiers shot and killed a
5-year-old boy and a teen-ager. Six other people were wounded,
including an American news photographer.
   Violence erupted today in the West Bank town of Jenin, where a
24-year-old man was shot in the stomach and a 50-year-old man was
hit in the neck when troops opened fire at stone-throwers,
officials at Al-Ittihad hospital in Nablus said. Both men were in
critical condition, the officials said.
   In Gaza City, a 16-year-old Palestinian was shot and seriously
wounded during another stone-throwing protest, officials at Ahli
Arab Hospital said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In response to the strike call, shops and schools were closed
throughout the Gaza Strip. Buses were not operating and horse-drawn
carts were the main mode of transportation.
   Palestinian flags flew from electricity poles and the tops of
mosques. Newly painted slogans were seen on walls, including one
declaring ``Yes to the liberation of Palestine, all Palestine.''
   In the West Bank, dozens of Jewish motorists were pelted with
stones on the main road to Jerusalem outside refugee camps near
Bethlehem. At the entrance to Bethlehem, troops stopped and
searched cars with Arab drivers.
   Pictures of PLO leader Yasser Arafat were stuck on traffic signs
in Bethlehem. Dozens of roads were blocked by barricades of stones
and burning tires.
   Among the six wounded on Tuesday was 37-year-old photographer
Neal Cassidy of Oakland, Calif., who was taking pictures of the
riot. Cassidy, who was on assignment for Frontline, an Oakland
biweekly, was the first foreign reporter shot in the 10-month-old
uprising.
   The two deaths Tuesday raised to 301 the number of Palestinians
killed since 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip began their uprising Dec. 8. Six Israelis have died.
   The Hadashot newspaper reported today that Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres renewed direct contacts with Jordan's King Hussein to
try to arrange talks on returning parts of the West Bank and Gaza
in exchange for peace.
   The Jerusalem Post daily, quoting the French television network
Antenne 2, also reported that contacts were made. It said the
contacts were between representatives of Hussein and aides to Peres.
   The reports did not elaborate.

   China on Wednesday inaugurated one of the world's
most advanced ``atom smashers,'' an underground machine physicists
use to study the basic structure of matter, the official Xinhua
News Agency said.
   The $65 million machine causes subatomic particles to collide
and disintegrate into tiny units that can be photographed.
   The machine is located in a 20-foot deep tunnel at the Chinese
Academy of Science Institute of High Energy. The accelerator
project, whose construction began in 1984, includes a 656-foot-long
linear accelerator, a radiation laboratory and a computer center.
   Zhou Guangzhaoo, president of the Academy of Science and head of
the project, called its completion ``one of the most important
advances in Chinese science in recent years,'' the agency said.

   At most rodeos, the crowd cheers for the
cowboy to stay atop the bucking bull. Bobby Rowe cheers for the
bull.
   Rowe lavishes love and kindness on his bulls in hopes that a few
will grow into the ornery 1,500-pound rodeo demons that throw the
toughest cowboys.
   Rowe, a former world champion saddle bronc rider, is looking for
a commercial formula for raising bucking bulls on a farm near
Dickson.
   ``It's like you can take five men, give them a ditch to dig,
tell them to do it and four of them won't get it done,'' Rowe said.
``That's the same with bulls. Some buck and some won't. It's a
matter of heart and attitude.''
   Rowe raises the bulls on the 1,400-acre Highland Rim Farm, which
he has operated for three years for owner Henry McCall.
   Hooked on the rodeo since he was a teen-ager, Rowe has developed
an eye for good bucking bulls over the years. The trainer first
tests the animals with mechanical riders and sends those that
continue bucking to Maury, Ky., to work out with a rodeo team.
   After more tests at local events the best bulls travel the
national rodeo circuit.
   ``That's the ones I like,'' Rowe said. ``I'm looking for the
best.''

   Unpack your parkas and pull out your
shovels _ the woolly bear caterpillars here are pointing to a long,
cold, snowy winter.
   Springfield highway chief Philip Pike, who presides over a
$935,600 snow plowing budget, hauled out three woolly bear
caterpillars Tuesday and declared it's going to be touch and go
whether the city will have enough funds to clear the streets this
winter.
   Pike maintains that measuring the width of the orange stripe on
the caterpillars and the bushiness of squirel tails is as reliable
a system as any for the annual municipal guessing game of how much
money to keep in the snow plowing accounts.
   ``What the heck. We have some fun with it and I've got as good a
record as anyone,'' Pike said. Circumstances permitting, of course.
Pike made no prediction last year because he couldn't find any
caterpillars.
   On one of the three test caterpillars he unscientifically
scooped up last weekend, the orange band takes up nearly the whole
body. On the other two it is much larger than the brown.
   The wider the orange, the more snow, he allowed. And the
squirrels in city parks have such bushy tails it's certain to be
cold as well, he contended.

   Nick Ameli Sr., who has worked at the
Bluewell Fire Department for 40 years, apologizes that he isn't as
active a firefighter as he was some years ago.
   Ameli is 83.
   ``Mostly I direct traffic now and answer the phone. More often I
make sure the men have coffee and refreshments waiting when they
return to the station after a call,'' he said.
   After 24 years as a miner, Ameli moved to Bluewell, where he
became a firefighter. He was one of the founders of the Volunteer
Fire Department and after retirement became an equally busy
volunteer.
   Today, he is proud of the three generations of Amelis who are
volunteer firefighters.
   A plaque placed on the fire house honors Ameli for work he did
on the building, which was completed in 1969.
   ``They didn't have any money to pay me for the work so the
plaque was put up,'' Ameli said. ``It will last longer than the
money would have anyway.''

Jersey.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In probably the most slashing attack so far
among the 33 Senate races across the country, a political spot for
Sen. Frank Lautenberg calls opponent Pete Dawkins ``a hypocrite''
and concludes: ``He'll move anywhere, say anything to get elected.''
   The ad is not alone _ indeed, there are many political spots
with almost as nasty a tone being aired around the nation. But that
it would be the product of an incumbent senator from New Jersey who
by all accounts enjoys a double-digit lead in the polls defies
traditional campaign wisdom.
   Normally, so-called ``attack videos'' are the tools of the
desperate. They have well-known political risks, so traditionally
have been used only in the closing stages of a campaign, and only
when a candidate is holding onto a slim and narrowing lead or needs
to close a wide gap quickly.
   This year the campaign book is being rewritten, and University
of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato has a name for the new
strain of negative advertising.
   ``They're infectious ads,'' Sabato says. ``They try to infect
the opposition with a deadly germ. They come from incumbents
attacking challengers before they have a chance to define
themselves.''
   In addition, he says, there no longer is a well-defined
progression from biographical ads early in a campaign, to positive
issue-oriented ads, to negative spots in the late stages.
   Attack ads have sprouted all over the political map:
   _ In North Dakota, state Rep. Earl Strinden is openly going
after incumbent Democrat Quentin Burdick's age. ``This isn't the
old Quentin Burdick we used to know,'' his ads say of the
80-year-old Burdick. ``It's time to come home, Quentin. You owe it
to all of us.''
   _ Rep. Connie Mack, the GOP front-runner in the Florida Senate
race, is styling his opponent, Rep. Buddy Mackay, as an
old-fashioned tax-and-spend Democrat. His ads conclude, in a voice
dripping with accusation: ``Hey, Buddy: You're liberal.''
   _ In Nevada, Gov. Richard Bryan's attack on incumbent GOP Sen.
Chic Hecht criticizes Hecht's voting record, then notes that he was
``voted the least respected senator in Washington'' by a group of
top Senate aides.
   _ In Minnesota, incumbent Sen. David Durenberger suggested that
his opponent, Democratic state attorney general Skip Humphrey,
shames the memory of his late father, Hubert Humphrey. ``Skip's
mudslinging doesn't fit in Minnesota,'' the ad said. ``Skip's great
late father never would have started a campaign this way. Skip's
father knew Minnesota.''
   ``I don't know how you get much more brutal than some of the
stuff that's out there now,'' said Tom Mason, spokesman for the
National Republican Senatorial Committee.
   ``Negatives are employed now as standard equipment,'' says
Sabato, noting that Lautenberg went straight to slashing attacks
when he went on the air after Labor Day, bypassing any positive
advertising.
   That first spot was a segment from Dawkins' own announcement
speech, with the sarcastic tagline, ``C'mon Pete. Be real.''
   Lautenberg insists he wanted to run on his record, primarily on
environmental issues, but was forced into negative attacks by
Dawkins' distortions of his record.
   The latest Dawkins spot accuses Lautenberg of personally
profiting from his Senate position through investments in companies
that do business with the government. The closing line, delivered
over sinister background music, is: ``Frank Lautenberg. He'll deny
anything to get elected, as long as he can make some money on the
side.''
   That triggered the latest Lautenberg blitz, which seeks to
capitalize on reports that Dawkins, who as a career military
officer moved around the country frequently, is a carpetbagger who
was shopping for a state to run in.
   Asked why he would take such a blunt approach while holding a
substantial lead in the polls, Lautenberg responded:
   ``If the question is, will you stand there and take the abuse
and turn the other cheek, the answer is no, I won't.'' And he
added, ``The audience likes the show. You hear negative campaigns
bemoaned, the hand-wringing ... Unfortunately, there are some
purveyors of ugliness who've found that it pays.''

<HEAD>Officials Says Special Diet Hens Producing Low-Cholesterol Eggs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS permits to permit in graf 3 bgng ``A state''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hens fed a secret diet have produced the
first eggs certified by the state of California as lower in
cholesterol than regular eggs.
   The eggs, 30 percent more expensive to the consumer than regular
eggs, went on sale Tuesday in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and
Ventura counties.
   A state permit confirms claims that the eggs have an average of
125 milligrams of cholesterol compared with an average 278
milligrams in a standard grade AA egg, Ardie Ferrill, supervisor of
egg inspection for the state Department of Food and Agriculture,
said Tuesday in Sacramento.
   High cholesterol levels in the blood have been linked to blood
vessel deposits that might lead to artery and heart disease.
   The American Heart Association recommends that an adult keep
below 300 milligrams the daily dietary intake of cholesterol.
   ``If the doc says you need a low cholesterol diet, this is just
the thing,'' said manager Paul May of Rosemary Farm of Santa Maria,
where the special-diet chickens are laying the eggs.
   Ferrill said the agency ran the eggs through laboratory tests
before issuing the permit that allows the farm to label its eggs as
lower in cholesterol. He said it was the first such permit issued
in California.
   The eggs were developed, in part, in consultation with
University of California scientists and a staff nutritionist, May
said, adding that they contain ``no drugs or additives.''
   May said about 25 percent of his farm's 300,000 chickens are fed
a diet currently being kept secret while lawyers see if it can be
patented.

<NOTE>Eds: LEAD with 14 grafs to UPDATE with early testimony by Bakker.

remove now-redundant first reference to bankruptcy court judge

<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker said today that
everything he did before leaving the television ministry in scandal
was for the good of the church and he did not misuse ministry funds.
   ``We believe in our faith that the church is the center of
society,'' Bakker told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.
``Everything we did came under the umbrella of the church. There
was no profit in anything we did.''
   Upon questioning by his attorney, Ryan Hovis, Bakker tried to
justify commercial entities such as a water park and various
lodging facilities and stores at the Heritage USA Christian retreat.
   ``It was, at least when I was there, a Christian center, a place
where people of like faith could come together, to sing and praise
God in the streets if they wanted to and not have to fear insult.
   ``Just because we're born again doesn't mean we don't need
drugstores, toothpaste and other needs. Why should those visiting
the church have to go elsewhere to have those needs met?'' Bakker
said.
   ``None of the stores, none of that activity was there for profit
for us.''
   Bakker testified as he and his attorneys began their defense
today in the bankruptcy trial against the PTL founder. PTL's
current leadership is seeking $52 million that it says was misspent
or mismanaged during the Bakker era.
   At one point Reynolds interrupted, pushing Hovis to get to the
point of ``what happened to the money.''
   ``I think you need to get into the dollars and cents. I think
everybody agrees it was a wonderful idea, but the question is did
he (Bakker) overdo it,'' Reynolds said.
   Bakker was scheduled to continue his testimony later today in
the trial, which resumed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after a
month recess. Bakker had briefly testified in the case last month.
   Also testifying for the defense this morning was an auditor who
said he found the television ministry in sound financial shape when
Bakker left it in 1987 amid a sex and money scandal.
   His attorneys questioned Allen Andrews, director of corporate
finances for Lockheed Corp., who did an audit of financial
statements and records of the television ministry and Heritage USA
theme park, documents dating from the last few years Bakker headed
the ministry.
   ``The statements that I reviewed didn't indicate any negative
situations,'' Andrews said. ``We found the corporation seemed to be
solvent, had good assets and revenues that seemed to be growing.''
   The audit was conducted over the past several weeks, Hovis said.
   Andrews said PTL ``generally looked like it was in sound
condition.''
   He also testified that the considerable travel expenditures and
cash advances, such as those received by Bakker before his
resignation in March 1987, were normal procedure for the chief
executive of a corporation.
   On Tuesday, Bakker said documents he had just received should
vindicate him against charges he failed to repay the television
ministry money he used for his own benefit.
   He told reporters he was ``a touch angry'' he was only now
receiving canceled checks and reimbursement receipts and hinted
they may have been purposely withheld.
   ``I think somebody calculated they would hold all the materials
until the middle of the trial,'' he said, though he did not say
who. The former television evangelist predicted his research would
satisfy at least 90 percent of the Internal Revenue Service's
concerns.
   In its suit against Bakker, his wife, Tammy, and former aide
David Taggart, PTL accuses Bakker of mismanaging the ministry. The
ministry presented testimony in the first week of the trial in
September that the Bakkers received about $9.5 million in bonuses,
salaries and other compensationfrom 1983 to 1987.
   An IRS agent also testified he found cash advances to Bakker and
Taggart that apparently served no legitimate business purpose.
   The ministry entered bankruptcy protection three months after
Bakker left in March 1987 after he admitted to a sexual encounter
with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker called the suit ``a trial for my life.''
   ``It may be business as usual for everyone else, but this is my
life I'm talking about,'' he said during a lunch break in the
hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Bakker attorney Jim Toms said his client's comments about
possible sabotage ``really reflect a frustration'' in trying to
prove his case based on records scattered among PTL offices, a
federal grand jury probe, and bankruptcy court. A federal grand
jury in Charlotte, N.C., has been investigating for more than a
year whether the ministry raised money for one purpose and used it
for another.
   In Tuesday's testimony, an independent financial analyst, James
Wilson, said PTL's finances from 1978 to 1986 showed it to be a
healthy, growing ministry without financial problems.
   Also Tuesday, a former PTL board member said Bakker deserved
every bonus he received while at the helm of the Fort Mill-based
television ministry and religious theme park.
   Evelyn Spencer told Reynolds she and other board members
consistently voted unanimously in favor of bonuses for Bakker.
   During the first half of the trial, PTL attorneys White and Brad
Leggett presented financial records and testimony from PTL
officials and an IRS agent that PTL claimed showed Bakker had
mismanaged the ministry.

   A man accused of masterminding a scheme
to claim a $15.2 million lottery jackpot with a fake ticket pleaded
guilty Wednesday in Dauphin County Court.
   Henry Arthur Rich, 33, pleaded guilty to theft by deception,
criminal conspiracy, forgery, tampering with public records, theft
by unlawful taking and unlawful use of a computer. Judge Sebastian
D. Natale waived sentencing until an investigation into Rich's
background and character is completed.
   Rich, a former employee of Control Data Corp., the firm that
provides computer services to the lottery, faces a 5- to 10-year
sentence for his role in the scam to claim a jackpot from the July
15, 1987, drawing.
   Rich's accomplice, Mark Herbst, 33, has already pleaded guilty
to theft, forgery and conspiracy.
   Herbst, a former video store clerk, was recruited by Rich to
present the forged ticket on April 28 and split the jackpot,
prosecutors said. He later cooperated with the authorities in their
investigation of Rich.
   Deputy Attorney General Michael J. Kane said Rich agreed to
plead guilty to all the counts in return for a concurrent sentence.
   Defense lawyer Harry Goldberg said he would ask the court for
probation or a lesser sentence because Rich has no prior criminal
record and has cooperated with investigators.
   Rich allegedly altered a computer program to produce a duplicate
of the winning ticket, which had been unclaimed for almost a year.
When Herbst appeared at lottery headquarter's to claim his first
check for almost $470,000, he told officials that he had been using
the ticket as a bookmark and had forgotten about it until he read a
newspaper article on the prize.
   Several days later, lottery officials stopped payment on the
check and questioned Herbst.
   Two top lottery officials have been required to pay a monetary
penalty because of their actions in the case.
   A New Jersey couple later claimed the prize.

   The under-30 crowd will get a chance Saturday
to learn how to become entrepreneurs, complete with pep talks from
some young millionaires.
   The seminars are being sponsored by the Small Business
Administration, which hopes to attract 15,000 participants to the
sessions on college campuses at 123 different sites across the
country.
   For a $15 registration fee, the Young Entrepreneur Seminars will
offer lectures on marketing, bookkeeping, business regulations and
developing a business plan. Local attorneys and accountants are
donating their services to conduct the seminars.
   Three out of four small businesses fail within the first year
with 90 percent of those failures attributable to bad management,
SBA officials said.
   ``Having a great idea is only one element of going into
business. You have to be prepared. We want to give them some
tools,'' said SBA official George Solomon.
   SBA officials said the seminars, which are aimed at persons 30
or younger, will feature talks by young entrepreneurs who have
successfully started their own businesses.
   Sophia Collier, 32, founder of the company which makes SoHO
Natural Soda, will be the keynote speaker at the New York City
seminar.
   SBA Administrator James Abdnor said he was encouraged by the
level of interest shown in advance registrations.
   He said at least 100 participants were expected at every one of
the locations and some colleges were expecting more than 400
participants.
   For persons interested in finding out information on the seminar
in their area, the SBA has this toll-free number: 1-800-368-5855.

   Lloyd Bentsen, heaping scorn on George
Bush in a must-win state where the Democrats have lost their lead,
said Wednesday that only the distortions of the Republican campaign
could allow the vice president to claim he's an environmentalist.
   ``Can anyone here give me just one piece of evidence to support
the claim George Bush made the other day when he woke up and
announced that he's an environmentalist?'' Bentsen asked his
audience of Stanford University students.
   The Democratic vice presidential nominee said Bush ``sat in the
Cabinet with (former Interior Secretary) James Watt and (former
Environmental Protection Agency chief) Anne Gorsuch _ the Bonnie
and Clyde environmental wrecking crew.''
   Today, he said, Bush is trying to minimize his past support of
offshore drilling in California while accusing Dukakis of opposing
anti-pollution efforts by airing television commercials on the
filth in Boston Harbor.
   ``They've been dumping in the Boston Harbor since a group of
patriots went down one night and threw some tea overboard,''
Bentsen said. ``Mike Dukakis is the first governor of that
commonwealth to do something about cleaning up the mess.''
   It was Bush's administration ``that cut off money to clean up
Boston Harbor,'' the Texas senator said. ``Mike Dukakis has the
endorsement of the League of Conservation voters, and as to George
Bush, well, he's no friend of the environment.''
   (In Boston, Dukakis picked up an endorsement from Russell W.
Peterson, the Republican former president of the National Audubon
Society, who credited the governor with financing programs to clean
up the Charles River and Boston Harbor.)
   Quoting Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Bentsen said that ``George
Bush might be an environmentalist ... it just depends on what
environment he is in.''
   Dukakis' running mate accused Republicans of bending the truth
and refusing to make specific proposals on important issues,
thereby ``reducing the caliber of a national campaign to that of a
mid-wrestling festival out at the Cow Palace,'' a sports arena
outside San Francisco.
   ``They have force-fed sound bites to the evening news and
laughed behind the backs of voters demanding some honesty about
America's future,'' Bentsen said.
   ``They have viciously slandered the patriotism and record of
Michael Dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness and
light when they are called to account,'' he said.
   Later, talking to reporters, Bentsen expressed frustration that
the GOP campaign was forcing the Democrats to spend their time
responding to false charges, such as a new TV commercial alleging
that Dukakis was opposed to new military projects.
   But Bentsen said it was necessary to respond so long as Bush's
people ``dump these kind of lies'' on the public.
   Bentsen spoke Wednesday in the shadow of Stanford's Hoover
Tower, named after Depression-era President Herbert Hoover, on the
first anniversary of the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash.
   The tower, he said, ``serves as a warning that this nation's
economy still hovers precariously in the shadows of a mountain of
international and domestic debt.''
   Bentsen was defiantly optimistic about the Democrats' chances of
winning the Nov. 8 election, even after learning that a new Field
Poll showed Bush leading 50 percent to 41 percent in California,
whose 47 electoral votes are the most of any state.
   The Republicans were trying to ``dig us a grave and tell us to
jump in,'' he said. ``Well, let's tell them to jump in the lake.''
   ``We're going to tell the experts to eat a little crow on the
morning of Nov. 9, and we may let them eat a little quail, too,''
he said, referring to Bush running mate Dan Quayle.
   Before leaving Stanford to fly to Kentucky, Bentsen visited the
Stanford Linear Accelerator with Nobel laureate Burton Richter and
Sally Ride, a former space shuttle astronaut who is a research
fellow at Stanford.
   Asked if she supported the Democrats, she told reporters she
would not back either party. ``Astronauts are non-non-partisan,''
she said.

<HEAD>State: Mother Of Nude Teen Dancer To Comply With `Son-Of-Sam' Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Florida law to keep felons from
profiting on stories about their crimes will get its first use in
the case of a woman convicted in the suicide of her daughter who
was a nude dancer, the state said Wednesday.
   Theresa Jackson, found guilty of mental child abuse almost a
year ago in Fort Lauderdale, has agreed to abide by the
10-year-old, so-called ``Son of Sam'' law, Attorney General Bob
Butterworth said.
   Ms. Jackson, 41, thought to be the first parent criminally
convicted in a child's suicide, has agreed to set aside certain
amounts from any film, television or book income she receives
related to the death of her 17-year-old daughter, Butterworth said.
   So far, no one has paid for the story of Tina Mancini, who shot
herself in March 1986, two months after she began working as a nude
dancer. Seven months later her mother was convicted of forgery,
child abuse and procuring a sexual performance by a child.
   Ms. Jackson, who was sentenced to a year in jail, is currently
free on bond appealing her conviction and sentence. Of the funds
that would be set aside, at least $35,000 would go to the state for
trial costs.
   The commitment by Ms. Jackson to comply with the statute is
contained in a proposed settlement to be presented to Broward
County Circuit Judge Arthur Franza, who presided over Ms. Jackson's
month-long trial.
   ``The defendant has agreed that all such income will go into a
state trust fund until her obligations under the statute have been
met,'' Butterworth said in a press release issued by his office.
   The Florida statute is based on a New York law that restricted
serial killer David ``Son of Sam'' Berkowitz from profiting from
books about his crimes.

   Jailed South African anti-apartheid leader Walter
Sisulu, his wife and seven children have been awarded the
Carter-Menil Human Rights Prize for their battle against the
country's system of racial separation.
   The award, created in 1986 to ``promote the protection of human
rights throughout the world,'' carries with it a $100,000 cash
prize.
   Sisulu, 76, has been in prison since 1964 when he was convicted
along with Nelson Mandela on sabotage charges. Mandela and Sisulu
were both founders of the outlawed African National Congress, and
Sisulu was twice elected secretary general of the organization.
   Walter's wife, Albertina, 63, is a co-president of the United
Democratic Front, a banned anti-apartheid coalition. The government
has imposed restrictions on her that limit her political activities
and bar her from making public statements. She works as a nurse.
   Five of the seven Sisulu children have been jailed or detained
at one time, with Zwelakhe Sisulu jailed since 1986 with no charge
filed against him.
   The younger Sisulu is editor of New Nation, a militantly
anti-apartheid weekly newspaper, and a former Nieman Fellow at
Harvard University.
   ``The continued existence of apartheid in South Africa is a blot
on the conscience of mankind,'' former President Jimmy Carter said.
The award is presented by the Carter-Menil Foundation, named for
Carter and Houston philanthropist Dominique de Menil.
   Mrs. de Menil joined Carter in making the announcement at
ceremonies Tuesday at the Carter Presidential Center.
   The Sisulus' ``leadership, fortitude and unwavering commitment
in fighting apartheid has given hope to all in South Africa who
oppose and suffer this unjust system,'' Carter said.
   Some of the children are in exile, and Carter said: ``All
members of the Sisulu family have endured extreme hardship,
including their painful separation by exile and detention. They
serve as a beacon of hope and a model of courage to all who oppose
apartheid.''
   ``By giving this award to the Sisulu family, we want to
demonstrate our solidarity with all those people both inside and
outside South Africa who are opposed to the system of apartheid,''
added Mrs. de Menil.
   The award will be presented at a Dec. 10 ceremony held on the
anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Carter said he expected some of the exiled family members
would be able to attend.
   Previous winners of the prize are Soviet physicist and dissident
Yuri Orlov; the Mutual Support of Guatemala, a group of family
members of those believed killed or kidnapped there; and La Vicaria
de la Solidaridad of Chile, which provides legal aid to political
prisoners and assists victims of human rights violations.

   The rights of eight immigrants accused
of belonging to a Marxist faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization were not violated during their deportation proceeding,
an appellate panel ruled.
   The four-member Board of Immigration Appeals rejected the
argument that the eight _ seven Jordanians and a Kenyan _ were
subjected to double jeopardy when the government stopped, then
reconvened their deportation hearing last year.
   The board Tuesday said the suspended hearing should resume.
   The eight, who all live in the Los Angeles area, were arrested
in January 1987 and originally charged under the McCarran-Walter
Act with advocating world communism because of their alleged ties
to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They denied
the accusation.
   The government then modified its charges, accusing two of the
eight of subversion and trying to deport the other six on various
immigration violations.
   The immigration judge threw out all the charges May 11, 1987,
when the government refused to produce as a witness a key
immigration official who signed the original arrest warrants.
   The next day, the government refiled the charges with the
signature of a different immigration official.
   Defense attorneys appealed on the grounds that restarting the
hearing was double jeopardy.
   But the immigration appeals board said prosecutors were ``not
attempting to `start over,''' but rather ``corrected'' the
signature on the arrest orders.
   Attorneys for the immigrants said they are considering whether
to appeal the board's decision.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Probe Patient's Claim of Knowledge About Church
Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities are looking into a dying
man's claim that he had information about the 1963 church bombing
that killed four black girls, even though the man's family and
friends say he has been having hallucinations.
   Gary Tucker, 54, a cancer patient at the Veterans Administration
hospital in Tuscaloosa, told the FBI on Friday that he had
knowledge of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Authorities
refused to disclose details of what Tucker told them.
   One man was convicted in the well-known case, but reports about
Tucker raised the specter that others also knew in advance about
the racially motivated bombing.
   Ku Klux Klansman Robert Chambliss was convicted of the murder in
1977 and sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 1985.
   FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz said the agency had not
developed a case based on Tucker's information, but turned it over
to the state prosecutor in Birmingham.
   Jefferson County District Attorney David Barber said Wednesday
he had discussed the information with Bob Eddy, who was an attorney
general's investigator on the bombing case. Barber would not
comment on whether Tucker was a credible informant.
   ``I don't have any comment I can make on it at this point. We're
not through doing what we're going to do,'' the district attorney
said. ``We're not going to make comments on half-knowledge.''
   Tucker has refused to talk with reporters. But his pastor and
relatives in Walker County, near Birmingham, dismissed his claim.
   ``Cancer is just eating him up. He's had a drug problem in the
past that crippled him up. He had a car wreck that crippled him.
They're just going to have to take him at face value,'' Tucker's
minister, the Rev. Dale Olmstead, said.
   Someone in Tucker's serious medical condition may make such
statements to get attention, he said.
   Tucker would have been 29 years old at the time of the Sept. 15,
1963, bombing. During Chambliss' trial in Birmingham, witnesses
talked about seeing other men in a car near the church the night
before the blast that killed 11-year-old Denise McNair, and Addie
Mae Collins, Cynthia Dianne Wesley and Carole Robertson, all 14.
   Two of Tucker's uncles also cast doubt on their nephew's ability
to give authorities reliable information.
   Theo Tucker of Sumiton said his nephew worked for him about five
years driving a truck. ``He drank so much alcohol and took so many
pills that the doctors told me it ate up his brain,'' his uncle
said.
   Another uncle, C.W. Tucker of Sumiton, said he didn't know of
any involvement of Gary Tucker with the Ku Klux Klan.
   And in Marietta, Ga., E.R. Fields, publisher of the
segregationist newspaper The Thunderbolt, said he was not familiar
with Tucker. ``At one time I knew most of the boys in the
Birmingham area. But the name `Gary Tucker' doesn't ring a bell
with me.''

   Shirley Temple Black, who as a child
movie star was grand marshal of the 50th Rose Parade in 1939, will
lead the 100th parade this January, the Tournament of Roses
announced Wednesday.
   ``It's an awesome, wonderful job and I'm looking forward to it
with great anticipation,'' said Mrs. Black, who was 10 when she
first led the annual floral spectacle down Colorado Boulevard.
   Mrs. Black, whose credits as a child actress included ``Little
Miss Marker,'' ``Bright Eyes,'' ``The Littlest Rebel'' and ``Wee
Willie Winkie,'' was the youngest grand marshal in the parade's
history.
   Only three others, Bob Hope, Richard Nixon and Earl Warren, have
been grand marshal of the parade twice.
   Mrs. Black left acting at a young age and in 1969 began a
government career that has included a term as U.S. ambassador to
Ghana.
   Just as it did in 1939, Jan. 1, 1989, falls on a Sunday so the
parade, watched annually by television audiences worldwide, and the
Rose Bowl football game will be held Jan. 2.

<TEXT>
   The blackened facade of a hotel stands as a
grim reminder of the cloudy morning a year ago when a crippled Air
Force fighter slammed into the lobby, killing 10 people in its
fireball.
   A small, white cross in front of the seven-story Ramada
Inn-Airport bears the words: ``In memory of the 10.'' The hotel
remains shut down.
   For the families of those who died in the crash on Oct. 20,
1987, the memories remain vivid and painful.
   ``All the families are just devastated,'' said Robert Goldberg,
whose 30-year-old daughter, Beth, was killed. ``We've had days this
week that were just as bad as the week after the accident.''
   Goldberg's daughter died when the powerless A-7D Corsair punched
through the clouds on an aborted emergency landing attempt and
slammed into the hotel. Moments earlier, the pilot, Maj. Bruce L.
Teagarden, had ejected safely.
   Teagarden, who was enroute from Pittsburgh to his home base in
Nevada, had lost his engine and was attempting a second run at the
Indianapolis International Airport. The pilotless jet slammed into
the hotel, a mile and a half from the runway.
   Teagarden, who was not seriously injured, was cleared of any
wrongdoing and resumed flying eight months after the crash. He is
in advanced training in Montgomery, Ala.
   Many of the victims' families will attend a memorial service
Thursday arranged by the Marion County Sheriff's Department at St.
Christopher's Catholic Church.
   Three of the dead were found behind the reception counter, two
were in an office behind the desk, two in a nearby laundry room and
two in the center of the lobby. The 10th victim, a salesman who had
stopped by to use a phone, died several days later.
   Charlotte Henry had talked to her daughter, Brenda, a hotel
maid, about 8 a.m., begging her to stay home with her 9-month-old
son, who was sick.
   ``By 10 after nine it was all over with. One of the girls (at
Mrs. Henry's office) told me something had happened at the
Ramada,'' she recalled.
   Mrs. Henry's grandson, Travis, now nearly 2 years old, is a
daily reminder of her 26-year-old daughter.
   ``I love him even more because he's a piece of her for me to
hold onto,'' Mrs. Henry said.
   Goldberg, whose daughter was the hotel's assistant sales
director, remembers the confusion and terror that he and his wife,
Harriet, felt after the 22-ton jet crashed.
   ``It was a day you never forget. You remember the flames, the
smoke, chasing around, the fear,'' he said. ``We were looking for
Beth and hoping she was going to appear and it never happened. You
ask yourself, `Did she suffer, did she try to get out?'''
   Larry Martin recently submitted a preliminary claim with the Air
Force for the death of his daughter Dawn Shelly Martin, 19, who was
a front desk clerk.
   Martin is a 28-year Air Force veteran who works at a bombing
range at Camp Atterbury near his rural Edinburgh home.
   ``I've never seen an A-7 since October 20th that I don't think
of my little girl lying there burning,'' he said.
   While his co-workers expressed sympathy on his daughter's death,
Martin says Air Force officials have ignored his loss.
   ``There is no justice in a society that would allow these things
to happen and not treat people with dignity and respect,'' he said.
``If I still feel this way in a few months, I'll probably seek
employment elsewhere.
   ``It hasn't gotten easier this first year,'' said Martin,
echoing the feelings of many of the families. ``I hope by next
spring my attention could get off of this.''

   Eskimo whalers wielding chain saws donated
by an oil company cut new breathing holes for three beleaguered
whales trapped two weeks in thick ice near the top of the world.
   The Eskimos on Tuesday cut three holes 75 yards apart in a line
leading away from the larger of two small breathing pools the
California gray whales have used since being stranded in the
Beaufort Sea while migrating south.
   The rescuers, who received a telephone pep talk Tuesday from
President Reagan, hope the new holes will influence the endangered
mammals to move in the direction they must travel if they are ever
to escape their icy corral.
   ``It'll be interesting to see if it works,'' North Slope Borough
biologist Craig George said as he dodged the slushy spray from
chain saws chewing through foot-deep ice 18 miles northeast of this
Inupiat Eskimo community. By Tuesday night, the whales hadn't moved
to the new holes, officials said.
   Standard Oil of Alaska donated three chain saws, and planned to
send a digging machine by helicopter to speed the work.
   Meanwhile, a long-shot attempt to free the whales with an
icebreaking barge was delayed until today.
   Two Alaska Army National Guard Skycrane helicopters have been
rigged to tow the 185-ton hovercraft barge from Prudhoe Bay, an oil
field about 200 miles southeast, in a tricky trip across Arctic
Ocean ice.
   The trip, which is expected to take 25 to 40 hours, was to have
started Monday or Tuesday, but was delayed when the barge got stuck
and was slowed again by refueling. Plans to get under way shortly
after daylight today were also put off, but rescuers were still
working through the morning and hoped to leave at about noon.
   Overnight, workers labored to decrease the amount of fuel on the
barge to reduce its weight by 70 tons.
   Army National Guard Chief Warrant Officer Tom Williams, a
helicopter copilot, said they hoped the barge, now that it's so
much lighter, wouldn't get bogged down in ``a goopy mess'' of mud
underneath ice close to shore, as it had Tuesday.
   ``The barge doesn't operate well unless it's over water or ice.
It started blowing mud out the sides and bogged down,'' he said
today as workers began getting ready for another try.
   By midmorning Alaska time, the National Guard office in Prudhoe
Bay said the much-delayed rescue mission was now scheduled to get
under way about noon (4 p.m. EDT), but few details of the morning's
efforts at the site were available. National Guard spokesman Mike
Haller had said earlier that if the barge could not be moved by
about noon today, officials would consider alternatives.
   Officials hoped to use the barge to carve a 40-foot path to open
water and freedom for the whales. The barge pulverizes ice with its
bulk and the fans that provide lift.
   Leads in the ice that were as close as five miles last weekend
have been plugged by shifting winds, record low temperatures and
drifting ice. By Tuesday night the nearest open water was believed
to be 100 miles away, officials said.
   The rescue effort, complicated by the harsh arctic conditions,
has become a race against time.
   The young whales are tired, and at least one has pneumonia.
Their barnacle-encrusted snouts have been worn raw from grating on
the jagged ice surrounding the breathing holes. The animals were in
shallow water only a few hundred feet from shore.
   Last week, ice around the holes was so thin biologists did not
dare walk on it. By Tuesday, with a record low temperature of minus
13 degrees, the ice was 18 to 24 inches thick.
   The whales are 24 to 30 feet long, but have shown no inclination
to smash their way to freedom.
   Their plight has drawn international attention.
   On Tuesday, Reagan telephoned Army National Guard Col. Tom
Carroll, commander of the rescue, to wish him well.
   ``I just wanted to tell you that everybody down here, their
hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you,'' Reagan
told Carroll, who was at the helicopter staging area at Prudhoe
Bay. ``Anything that we can say or do to help you along with the
success of the operation, we'd be pleased to do it.'' Biologists
said they were overwhelmed by the interest shown in the whale
drama. Scores of people have called with ideas to free the mammals,
such as using explosives, dropping bowling balls to break the ice,
or netting the whales for transport elsewhere.
   ``Every year, probably dozens of grays drown or are crushed by
the ice, but nobody ever knows about it,'' said George.
   But Ron Morris of the National Marine Fisheries said this case
is different. The whales are a little more than 100 yards from
shore and are easily viewed.
   ``It's simple. It happens every time with whales ... with any
marine mammals,'' Morris said. ``They're portrayed as gentle
creatures and the situation out there (on the ice) is sad; it's
really sad.''

<HEAD>Judge Wants Tougher Penalty, Rejects Cordis Plea in Pacemaker Suit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $123,000 fine does not compensate for thousands
of defective heart pacemakers and corrosion-prone batteries sold by
the Cordis Corp., a federal judge said Wednesday in rejecting the
company's plea bargain.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus pointed to a federal Food and
Drug Administration pre-sentencing report saying the company
knowingly continued to distribute the defective equipment between
December 1983 and October 1985.
   ``I am troubled by this report,'' Marcus said. ``It was my duty
to decide whether this plea agreement and guilty plea served the
interests of justice. ... I find that they do not.''
   Cordis is accused of 23 counts of selling defective pacemakers
between 1980 and 1985. The FDA said the devices, implanted under
the skin to regulate the heartbeat, could stop without warning.
   On Aug. 31 the company had agreed to plead guilty to the
charges, and faced the fine plus $141,000 in court costs under a
deal worked out with federal prosecutors.
   In rejecting that deal, Marcus criticized the government for
failing to file charges under a 1985 change in the law that would
have allowed fines of up to $500,000 per count, instead of the
maximum $10,000 under the older law. He set a new hearing on the
case for Oct. 26.
   The ruling does not affect a separate indictment of four former
Cordis officers, who have all pleaded innocent in that case.
   After Marcus' ruling, attorneys for both Miami-based Cordis and
the government defended the plea agreement.
   Cordis ``is no longer in this business and has a new
management,'' said U.S. Justice Department prosecutor Raymond
Philipps. ``We don't want to put the company out of business.''
   Cordis attorney Sherwin Markman said the fine is not the only
penalty that Cordis has suffered, noting it was required to sell
off the pacemaker division and has lost tens of millions of dollars.
   The company reported net losses of $56.1 million in 1987, but
underwent a major restructuring since selling the pacemaker
operation to Telectronics of Australia. Net earnings for 1988
totaled $2.4 million on sales of $132 million.
   The FDA report said that betweeen December 1983 and October
1985, Cordis shipped 2,200 pacemakers that were subject to
potential failure and 6,000 batteries they knew were subject to
corrosion.
   But company spokesman Chick McDowell denied that, saying Cordis
had never been charged with that offense.
   Cordis' main operations now include making catheters for
diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for monitoring
pressure on the brain.
   When the pacemaker case was announced, federal officials called
it the most significant felony prosecution to date under the 1976
Medical Device Amendments to the FDA law.

   The next president should decrease the number
of officials he appoints and fill more jobs with career
professionals, members of a privately financed commission said
Wednesday.
   A task force of the National Commission on the Public Service
sent the recommendations to both Vice President George Bush and
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. The commission,
which includes former top public officials, is to make its final
recommendations to enhance government service in a report next
February.
   The head of the task force, former Cabinet officer Elliot
Richardson, told a news conference the number of political
appointments has been increasing steadily. The commission headed by
former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker says there are
nearly 2,400 positions in the government that can go to political
appointees.
   Richardson's task force recommended that the White House
establish qualifications that appointees should have for positions
that need Senate confirmation.
   It also urged that the new president give ``significant weight''
to the recommendations of his Cabinet officers in the selection of
their subordinates.
   It also recommended that both the president and department heads
fill more positions in the middle and upper levels with career
civil servants.
   ``If a career employee can no longer hop to be a deputy
assistant secretary, it will be hard to recruit or keep the best
and brightest young people for public service,'' the task force
said.
   The commission, which is a privately funded group set up for a
two-year study beginning in 1987, met Wednesday to review its
preliminary recommendations. Its basic proposals are to be sent to
the president-elect before its final report is issued.

<TEXT>
   The city paid tribute Wednesday to Mikhail
Baryshnikov and his American Ballet Theater after they wowed a high
society audience with an effervescent cancan at the European
premiere of ``Gaiete Parisienne.''
   At a party in City Hall, Mayor Jacques Chirac praised the
troupe, which is on its first trip to Europe in more than a decade.
   Its return to the French stage Tuesday night was a high point in
the city's cultural season, now in full swing with plays, concerts
and exhibitions filling theaters and exhibition spaces. The
company, which performs through Sunday, is part of Paris' 26th
International Festival of Dance.
   The troupe romped through opening night with a wicked joie de
vivre in a fluorescent flash of costumes by Christian Lecroix, the
rage of French haute couture.
   Turquoise-ruffled tulle, dotted chartreuse, zebra-striped gloves
and orange ostrich-plumed hats stretching toward the sky, the
splendid costumes were icing on Baryshnikov's delectable pastry
served up at the elegant Theater Champs Elysees.
   Among the first-night audience who paid $500 a seat were actor
Jack Nicholson, director Roman Polansky, the Baroness Guy de
Rothschild, Rudolf Nureyev, Prince Mubarak Al Sabah and U.S.
Ambassador Joe Rodgers.
   Lecroix's costumes were inspired by the Belle Epoch and
Toulouse-Lautrec rather than by the more staid Second Empire, which
was the basis for the costumes in the original production of
``Gaiete Parisienne.''
   The ballet was created in 1938 by Leonide Massine, the world's
best-known ballet choreographer between the wars, for the Ballet
Russe de Monte Carlo. It was performed continuously each season
from the time it was created until about 1960, but has fallen out
of fashion and is rarely performed these days.
   Set to the bubbling music of Jacques Offenbach, the ballet is a
series of frothy divertissements that tell of the flirtations and
romantic adventures of the demimonde in the 19th century. A flower
girl and a glove vendor compete for the attention of aristocrats,
soldiers, dandies and a naughty, mysterious Peruvian.
   The action takes place in a fantasy cafe, where the characters
enter down a sweeping, red-carpeted staircase framed by a pair of
pink French windows through which glows the Eiffel Tower.
   The centerpiece of the production, restaged for the American
Ballet Theater by Lorca Massine, the choreographer's son, is a
dazzling cancan.
   Eugenia Delarova Doll, the original flower girl and Massine's
wife at the time of the first production, once said that the cast
had so much fun performing the ballet they made ``the audience want
to come up on stage and dance with us.''
   The effect was the same Tuesday night, with the audience
breaking into spontaneous clapping as long-legged girls in polka
dot tights and ruffles kicked high to the familiar cancan melody.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Baryshnikov, artistic director for
the company, in an interview after the ballet. ``Gala audiences are
known for being very conservative and we were very enthusiastically
received.''
   The first half of the program was less successful, opening with
the lackadaisical ``Fandango,'' a mock Spanish dance performed by
five ballerinas. ``Le Jardin de Villandry,'' performed by a trio of
two men and a woman was reminiscent of the Francois Truffaut film
``Jules et Jim.''
   After the ballet, dancers mixed with the beau monde, at a dinner
in the Petit Palais museum. Many of those walking past the museum's
collection were works of art themselves, dressed in gowns by Yves
St. Laurent, Givenchy and, of course, Lecroix.
   A string orchestra played at the top of the spiral staircase
down which ballerinas glided toward candlelit tables and champagne.

<HEAD>Markie Post Says Movie Career More Attractive Than Series
Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Markie Post, who plays prosecutor
Christine Sullivan on NBC's ``Night Court'' comedy series, says she
would like to do more movies, and the recent scriptwriter's strike
helped.
   ``I'm locked into a seven-year contract on `Night Court,' so
it's important I do a lot of film work during my time off,'' she
said in a recent interview.
   During the five-month writers' strike, she completed
made-for-television movies ``Glitz'' with Jimmy Smits for NBC and
``Tricks of the Trade'' with Cindy Williams for CBS.
   ``Glitz,'' which will be broadcast Friday, is about a showgirl
and detective who team to solve a murder. ``Tricks of the Trade''
is described as a comedy about prostitutes.
   While scripts in progress were stopped during the strike,
completed scripts, such as ones for television movies, were shot
during the long walkout.
   ``I love television and I wouldn't mind working in it for the
rest of my career,'' said Miss Post. ``But in television, time is
so compressed that you have to cram it all in, the work, the
family, everything. But with a feature film career, you work for
certain periods and then you're off. That seems attractive to me
right now because of Kate,'' the 14-month-old daughter she had with
husband-actor Michael Ross.

   A federal appeals court Wednesday
stayed the execution of a onetime motorcycle gang leader less than
12 hours before he was scheduled to die for the rape and murder of
a tavern waitress.
   The execution of George ``Tiny'' Mercer would have been the
first in Missouri since 1965. The action by a three-judge panel of
the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was the second time this
month the court has blocked an execution in the state the same day
it was to occur.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster's office planned to
immediately file a motion to vacate the stay with the entire
10-member court.
   ``We're filing this motion because we believe the issues are
easily resolved in favor of the state,'' said Mary Jenkins, a
spokesman for Webster. ``We feel like nine years has been an
adequate length of time for the appeals process.''
   Mercer, 44, was to have been put to death by lethal injection at
12:01 a.m. Thursday at the Missouri State Penitentiary.
   In its unanimous decision to grant a stay, the three-judge
panel, meeting in St. Paul, Minn., said it needed more time to
review Mercer's case.
   If the entire Appeals Court were to vacate the stay, Mercer's
court-appointed lawyer, Douglas S. Laird, could appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   U.S. District Judge Scott Wright of Kansas City had refused to
stay Mercer's execution Tuesday, citing the ``incredibily heinous
nature'' of the crime.
   Mercer was sentenced to death in 1979 for the rape and
strangulation of 22-year-old Karen Keeton at his home in Belton,
south of Kansas City.
   Records show friends brought Ms. Keeton to Mercer, who was free
on bond in the rape of a 17-year-old girl, as a ``birthday
present.'' During the assault in which Mercer forced Ms. Keeton to
have sex with him at gunpoint before killing her, Mercer's
11-year-old daughter was in the house.
   At the time of his conviction, Mercer was reported to be a
leader of two morotocycle gangs in the Kansas City area _ the
Rancid Riders and the Missing Links. He has contended that
prejudice against motorcycle gangs is the reason he was convicted
of killing Ms. Keeton.
   Mercer's execution would mark the state's first in 23 years, the
first time the death penalty has been carried out under the state's
11-year-old reinstated capital punishment law and the first use in
Missouri of lethal injection.
   Prison authorities began preparations for execution last month
after convicted killer Gerald Smith demanded that further appeals
be dropped so his execution could be carried out.
   Smith's scheduled execution Oct. 4 was blocked by the 8th
Circuit just hours before it was to occur. The federal judges
wanted more time to review Smith's competency.

<HEAD>Givens To Tyson: Here's Your Divorce, Keep The Money</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Givens' statement that she will seek
no money settlement in divorce. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Robin Givens said today she would give
heavyweight boxing champion Michael Tyson a divorce without taking
any money from him for herself.
   ``I never wanted anything but what was best for Michael,''
Givens said in a statement read by her lawyer, Raoul Felder. ``I
never wanted anything for myself and I never sought anything for
myself.''
   The statement was issued by Felder at a news conference in his
office. Givens was not present.
   The actress, who appears on ABC's situation comedy ``Head of the
Class,'' decried the publicity surrounding the divorce action she
initiated earlier this month and said she wanted Tyson and herself
to go forward with their lives in dignity.
   ``Therefore, although I understand my lawyers are waiting for an
offer in money, the exact amount of which is not ascertained at
this time, but presumably it will be considerable, before it is
forthcoming, I unequivocally and irrevocably state as follows:
   ``1. Michael can have his divorce.
   ``2. I will not seek nor accept any money for myself.''
   Tyson was in Venezuela and not immediately availalbe for
comment. Earlier today, the New York Post published a story quoting
him as saying his failed marriage has made him ``almost
anti-women,'' but conceded he still loves Givens.
   Givens filed for divorce Oct. 7 in California, citing
irreconcilable differences. If Givens had been able to prove that
the couple actually resided in California, the state's community
property divorce law would have provided that the couple split the
earnings received during the marriage.
   Tyson won a a multimillion-dollar purse in a heavyweight
championship bout this summer. The couple were married in February.
   Last Friday in Trenton, N.J., Tyson filed for divorce and
annulment of their marriage, claiming that Givens tricked him into
marrying her by falsely claiming she was pregnant.
   ``I'm learning so much from this, but I wouldn't wish a divorce
on my worst enemy,'' said Tyson, 22, in the Post interview.
   ``I'm still madly in love with Robin,'' he said, but added, ``I
can't go back with her. I couldn't do it. ... I think that she is
basically a good person, but now, after all this, who would want to
be with her?''
   ``I'm almost anti-women, after what I've been through,'' he said
with a laugh.
   The boxer confessed that ``the nicest girl I've ever met'' was
former Miss America Suzette Charles, 25, whom he dated briefly
before marrying Givens in February. ``I should've taken my chances
with Suzette, but I was too wild back then,'' he said.
   Charles, of Los Angeles, told the Newspaper she was flattered by
Tyson's comments, but said ``we were just friends.''

<TEXT>
   The crash Wednesday of an Indian
Airlines jetliner in the central city of Ahmedabad is the worst
disaster in the 26-year history of the carrier, which has been
accused of lax safety procedures.
   At least 130 people were killed in the airline's 16th major
accident since it was formed 26 years ago to handle domestic
traffic and short flights to neighboring countries.
   The worst previous accident for the airlines was in 1976, when a
Caravelle aircraft exploded at Bombay airport while landing.
Ninety-five people were killed in the crash, blamed on leaking fuel
pipes.
   In 1973, 49 people died when a Boeing 737 made a crash landing
short of the runway at New Delhi airport.
   Indian Airlines is owned by the government, as is Air-India,
which operates only on international routes.
   Wednesday's crash comes 12 years after the last fatal accident
on the airlines, but some recent reports have criticized safety
measures.
   In June, the pilot of an Indian Airlines plane forgot to lower
the landing gear before landing at New Delhi. The aircraft
slithered along the runway on its belly but no one was hurt.
   India Today newsmagazine said in its latest issue that safety
measures were ignored on Indian Airlines flights and that pilots
``exhibited a cavalier disregard for their own and passengers'
lives.''
   ``Mandatory safety-related procedures are often reduced to a
paper exercise,'' the magazine said. ``Doctors who conduct
pre-flight alcohol tests on pilots sign stacks of reports _ the
pilot just fills his name, date and flight number.''
   The airline refused comment.
   In September 1986, the pilot of an Indian Airlines Airbus
aborted takeoff at Madras airport after the nose of the aircraft
was already in the air. Newspaper reports said heavy concentrations
of alcohol were found in the blood of the pilot, the co-pilot and
the engineer of the plane.
   Indian Airlines is the largest regional airline in South Asia.
It operates flights to 73 airports in India and nine in neighboring
countries.

   A 21-year veteran of the city police
department opened fire in the county courthouse today and killed
his estranged wife, the county's first female judge, authorities
said.
   Police said Clarence Ratliff, 53, was taken into custody and
that his wife, District Judge Carol S. Irons, 40, was killed in the
incident shortly after noon today. There were no other injuries
reported.
   Irons, elected in 1982, was the first woman judge in Kent County.
   After the initial shooting, the wounded judge ran from her
chambers into a nearby courtroom, while her husband chased her and
fired at least two or three more shots, police said.
   She died in the courtroom. Police Chief William Hegarty said it
was not immediately clear whether the judge was wounded a second
time during the chase.
   A witness, John Smith, said he was just leaving the building
when ``I heard three shots, rapid fire'' and saw ``people running
out of the building, falling on the floor. I ran because I didn't
want to be hit.''
   The police chief said Ratliff had no history of mental problems
and there was no reason to believe Irons feared him. Irons called
the police dispatcher on an intercom at 12:07 p.m. and said her
estranged husband had a weapon to her head, Hegarty said.
   Police said Ratliff was off duty at the time of the incident and
was wearing street clothes. It was not immediately determined if a
police gun was used in the shooting.
   Gunshot sailed over the heads of some employees who were in
chambers with the victim, said the senior judge in the county,
Chief Judge Donald Johnston.
   ``In addition to a lot of criminal suspects here, the people
here are undergoing severe strees involved in divorces, child
custody. ... There are a lot of wrought emotions here,'' Johnston
Johnston said. ``There's a potential threat continually.''
   The Hall of Justice, which houses courts and the Grand Rapids
Police Department, was cordoned off and surrounded by police cars
and ambulances.
   Court staff workers were crying and consoling one another
following the shooting, and officials said the courts would be
closed for the rest of the day.

   A black man once shown in a City Hall
mosaic as a smiling freed slave now carries a hoe and has a
different smile, ending a dispute that started when critics said
the artwork was demeaning to blacks.
   The 10- by 40-foot mosaic, created in the mid-1960s, showed
white settlers in covered wagons and a smiling freed slave,
celebrating his freedom with a broken rope hanging from his wrists.
   Complaints about the mural started in 1986, but the City Council
did not approve the changes until a year ago. The $1,200 project
was financed by private donors.
   The new tile work was finished on the mosaic Tuesday.
   ``The black man now has a hoe in his hand and the smile that he
wore was changed a bit. It's a nice smile,'' said city Clerk Nina
Baird, whose first-floor office is only a few steps from the
mosaic. ``It's nice to have it over with.''
   The son of late designer Edward Kane filed a lawsuit in March in
an unsuccesful attempt to stop the revisions, claiming they would
infringe on the rights of artists.

<HEAD>Bakker Says All PTL Activities For Church, Not His Profit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BROOKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker on Wednesday
defended his stewardship of the ministry before it sought
bankruptcy protection, denying an IRS claim that the church bought
him such luxuries as two Rolls-Royce cars.
   ``We believe in our faith that the church is the center of
society,'' Bakker told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.
``Everything we did came under the umbrella of the church. There
was no profit in anything we did.''
   Bakker took the stand in PTL's $52 million lawsuit which claims
he, his wife, Tammy, and former top aide David Taggart mismanaged
the ministry into ruin and used PTL funds for their personal gain.
   Referring to an IRS report listing items it said the ministry
had provided Bakker for his personal benefit, Bakker said he
personally paid for a houseboat, an unfinished 300-foot water slide
at his home and the two luxury cars.
   Bakker said he donated the houseboat and cars to PTL, as well as
a third Rolls-Royce which was given to him.
   ``I had in regular practice given back to the ministry. Part of
Christianity is giving,'' he said. ``The Heritage Village Church
has never, ever purchased a Rolls-Royce for me or my family.''
   Bakker said a jet PTL officials claim he used at will for
personal travel was only actually used by him ``between 10 and 20
times.''
   ``As far as I'm concerned all of the trips were for the
ministry,'' he said.
   In other testimony, independent financial analyst James Wilson
suggested that Bakker was underpaid for the number of
responsibilities he held. Bakker, he said, should have received
about $6.5 million a year before fringe benefits. Tammy Faye Bakker
could have been paid more than $2 million a year for her duties.
   Last month the ministry presented evidence that the Bakkers
received about $9.5 million in bonuses, salaries and other
compensation from 1983 to 1987.
   PTL sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors
three months after Bakker left in March 1987, when he admitted to a
sexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker said he assumed responsibility for the way PTL dealt with
Ms. Hahn, but said he didn't know about the hush money it offered
her.
   ``But I knew we were being blackmailed and I take full
responsibility,'' he responded to a question by his attorney Ryan
Hovis.
   Also testifying for Bakker's defense was Allen Andrews, director
of corporate finances for Lockheed Corp., who audited some of PTL's
financial statements and records for the period of Bakker's
stewardship.
   ``We found the corporation seemed to be solvent, had good assets
and revenues that seemed to be growing,'' Andrews said. Bakker's
attorney Ryan Hovis said the audit was conducted over the past
several weeks.
   Andrews said PTL ``generally looked like it was in sound
condition.''
   He also said that the considerable travel expenditures and cash
advances, such as those received by Bakker before his resignation
in March 1987, were normal procedure for the chief executive of a
corporation.
   An IRS agent has testified he found cash advances to Bakker and
Taggart that apparently served no legitimate business purpose.
   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., has been investigating
for more than a year whether the ministry raised money for one
purpose and used it for another.

<HEAD>Libel Lawsuit Filed By Comair Airline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A regional airline has filed a libel suit
against the attorney for five crew members who contend they were
held against their will in a hotel room to undergo drug tests.
   The lawsuit says Covington lawyer Garry L. Edmondson told
reporters at a news conference in September that Comair Airline
managers ``shanghaied'' the pilot and four flight attendants and
used ``Gestapo-like tactics'' to obtain urine samples.
   The suit contends the statements damaged the reputation of
Comair, which is based at Greater Cincinnati International Airport
near Hebron, Ky.
   The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages, was filed Tuesday in Ohio's Hamilton County Common Pleas
Court. The county includes the bulk of the Cincinnati area's
newspaper readers and television viewers, Comair attorney Richard
Creighton said.
   Edmondson said he had not seen the lawsuit and would not comment
on it except to say, ``sounds desperate to me.''
   Also Tuesday, six Comair executives were charged with
misdemeanor unlawful imprisonment. Boone County Attorney Larry
Crigler said he filed the charges at the request of the employees
who said they were held against their will.
   He said no physical restraint was involved, but that the company
figures used their managerial authority to order the employees not
to leave.
   The five employees say they were coerced into taking surprise
drug tests. The employees say the tests showed no evidence of drug
use.
   ``The company denies that any of the conduct that is complained
of was criminal in nature,'' Creighton said Tuesday. The airline
also has denied liability in civil lawsuits filed Sept. 22 by the
airlines' employees.
   Comair fired five other employees, including three pilots, last
month, reportedly because the five either failed drug tests or
admitted that they used drugs while off duty. The three pilots have
filed grievances against the company.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed a regulation
that would require random drug screening of ten of thousands of
pilots, flight attendants and other airline employees. Airline
labor unions oppose the measure, arguing there is no evidence of a
problem in the industry to warrant it.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi said Wednesday
the death toll from civil war and famine in his country was 20
times lower than Western estimates, and he rejected criticism of
his handling of the crisis.
   Mahdi said his government has taken ``great measures'' in trying
to help thousands of refugees witnesses describe as being ``no more
than skin over bone.''
   Western relief officials, who compare the situation in Sudan to
the Ethiopian famine of recent years, said Tuesday that about
260,000 people have died in 1988 because of lack of food and
medical care during long treks to escape the fighting in southern
Sudan.
   Mahdi said in an interview with The Associated Press that ``I
don't think the loss of life was more than 10 per 1,000.'' That
would be the equivalent of about 13,000.
   He acknowledged that the army, which represents the Moslems in
the north, has suffered setbacks in recent fighting against the
southern rebels, most of whom are Christians or animists fighting
for autonomy.
   But Mahdi, a Moslem, said the government has acted effectively
to help thousands of refugees whom witnesses have described as
being ``no more than skin over bone.''
   ``The United Nations representative has recognized the great
measures taken by the Sudanese government to bring relief to the
displaced. He generally approved the way the situation was
handled,'' said the prime minister, who was interviewed in his
office in Khartoum.
   ``Criticism of the government floated by some is misinformed,''
said Mahdi, dressed in a traditional Sudanese flowing white robe
and white turban.
   Some Western relief experts have charged that the government has
not been effective in easing the plight of the southerners fleeing
on foot hundreds of miles northward or east into Ethiopia.
   Bona Malwal, editor of the English language daily The Sudan
Times, this week criticized the government's relief effort as ``too
little, too late.''
   An estimated 2 million people have abandoned their homes since
the rebellion began in 1983. About 1.3 million of them set out this
year alone.
   Fritz Gilbert, who heads the U.S. aid program in Sudan, told the
AP Wednesday that the southern refugees are ``starving and dying in
terrible numbers.''
   He said he has no exact figure but believes there are hundreds
of thousands of victims. The magnitude of the Sudanese problem can
be compared to the famine in Ethiopia in recent years, Gilbert said.
   This year, about 700,000 southerners trekked to Khartoum,
150,000 to Juba in the province of Equatoria, 300,000 to Ethiopia
and 150,000 to Kordofan and Darfur provinces in southwestern Sudan,
according to UNICEF, the United Nation's child-welfare agency.
   A U.S.-funded operation to bring relief to the tiny town of
Abyei, 500 miles southwest of Khartoum, entered its seventh day
Wednesday.
   Gilbert said government and foreign supplies to Abyei can feed
only 15,000 until the end of the rainy season this month, while
there are up to 30,000 refugees in the town.
   ``The people arrived in terrible shape, having trekked hundreds
of miles,'' Gilbert said. ``Food was insufficient, and they started
to starve and die. Kids are in very poor condition.''
   Witnesses who traveled to Abyei on relief planes reported that
they saw thousands of people who were ``no more than skin over
bone.'' The witnesses said children seemed to be the worst off.
   Western relief officials, who asked not to be identified, say up
to 10 people are dying in Abyei every day.
   Mahdi said his government regularly reviews the activities of
more than 90 relief organizations in Sudan to check if they are
operating legally.
   ``Some non-governmental organizations, because of their own
motivations and ideals, may have other than humanitation activities
in mind,'' he said. The government has accused some agencies of
delivering supplies to the rebels and thus prolonging the war.
   Mahdi said that since taking office in April 1986, he has made
13 peace offers to renegade army Col. John Garang, the leader of
the guerrillas, but has received no firm response.
   The rebels have said they captured six army positions in recent
weeks, but the government has acknowledged the loss of only four.

   The remains of six U.S. servicemen missing
from the Vietnam War have been positively identified by an Army
laboratory, including one man whose remains were salvaged from
North Vietnam by a refugee, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   The six, all aviators, include four Air Force officers, a Navy
officer and a Marine officer, the Pentagon added in a statement.
They were identified by the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory in Honolulu after being recovered this summer.
   Remains of one of the six, Air Force Maj. Robert C. Edmunds,
were returned to U.S. officials by a Vietnamese refugee who came
forward during interviews last June at a refugee camp in Malaysia,
said Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman.
   ``This is the first occurrence that we know of in which a
refugee from Vietnam has provided remains that proved to be from a
missing American,'' Schneider said.
   ``On three other occasions, however, Laotian nationals have
turned over remains that proved to be from Americans missing in
Laos.''
   The remaining five sets of remains were among a group of 25
repatriated by the Vietnamese government on July 13. Schneider said
the five identified Wednesday were the first from that group of 25
to be positively identified.
   ``The remains will depart Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii with a
full military honors ceremony on Thursday and travel to Travis Air
Force Base, Calif., for their final journey home,'' the Pentagon
statement said.
   The Pentagon identified the missing servicemen as:

   With the latest identification, 2,387 Americans continue to be
listed as missing in Indochina as a result of the Vietnam war, of
whom 1,751 are listed as missing in either North or South Vietnam.
   All told, the remains of 168 Americans have been returned to the
United States from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the Army
lab since the end of the war.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the cooperation of the
Vietnamese that resulted in the accounting for these Americans and
hopes that such unilateral turnovers of information and remains
will continue along with the joint investigative efforts begun in
September 1988,'' the Pentagon said in its statement.

<HEAD>FAA Expediting Order for Closer Check of Older Boeing 737s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said
Wednesday it was speeding up an order for more thorough inspections
of aging Boeing 737 jetliners after a row of cracks, including one
a foot long, was found on a Continental Airlines plane.
   But FAA and industry officials said the cracks, discovered by
Continental workers on Oct. 5 while the plane was being repainted,
may have been caused by the improper patching of the plane more
than two years ago and not by stress from aging.
   Federal authorities are asking Continental for records of the
repair work, which apparently took place when the plane was
operated by now-defunct Frontier Airlines, to determine whether the
50-square-inch patch had been attached properly.
   Continental absorbed Frontier in l986.
   The older Boeing 737s have been the focus of attention since
last April, when a 20-foot section of the roof of an Aloha Airlines
plane tore away at 24,000 feet. A flight attendant was swept to her
death, but the plane landed safely.
   The new FAA-directed inspections have been under review for
months, but were ordered sped up after the discovery of the crack
on the Continetnal plane. The order is expected to be issued later
this week, probably Friday, said FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn.
   The inspections, aimed at older Boeing 737s with 40,000 or more
landings, are not likely to interfere with normal operations
because the FAA will allow the checks to be conducted during
routine maintenance. Some air carriers with older 737s likely
already have begun the inspections in anticipation of the order,
officials said.
   It was not clear how many 737s would be subject to the
inspection order. According to the Boeing Co., about 225 of the
twin-engine jets have had close to 40,000 landings, although some
of those probably are foreign-owned. The Aloha plane had more than
89,000 landings.
   According to the Air Transport Association, 570 Boeing 737s were
being operated by U.S. airlines at the end of l987, but many are
newer models that likely would not be subject to the surveillance.
The planes are widely used by Continental, United Airlines, Delta
Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines, USAir and Southwest Airlines.
   Under the order, airlines must conduct the inspections in some
cases, within 500 landings or when the plane reached a total of
40,000 landings and use sophisticated electronic equipment to
detect small cracks in some areas of the aircraft. The FAA also
will require another inspection within 15 months or 4,500
additional landings, officials said.
   Last spring, the FAA directed the close inspection of horizontal
``lap joints'' on older Boeing 737s where sections of metal skin
overlap. The new inspections also will cover vertical metal skin
joints, require additional use of so-called ``eddy current''
testing using electronic gear, and require paint to be stripped if
there is a buildup that might hide cracks, officials said.
   Earlier this year a joint FAA and industry task force examined
how better monitor the structural condition of the aging jet fleet
_ not only 737s but also many Boeing 727s and McDonnell Douglas
DC-9s _ and recommended a broader inspection program.
   But so far, only older Boeing 737s have been subject of special
FAA inspection orders.
   Meanwhile, two federal agencies are trying to determine why the
cracks on the Continental Boeing 737, which had 55,000 landings
were not discovered earlier. Continental spokesman have said the
plane was inspected May 20 and no cracks were found.
   The jet, like the one involved in the Aloha incident, was 19
years old and was among the first 291 Boeing 737s that used a
so-called ``cold bonding'' method of attaching sections of metal
skin to the fuselage.
   ``The question right now is when was the repair made, who made
the repair and how was the repair made. So far we haven't found
anything,'' said Jack Gambel, a spokesman for the Boeing Co. in
Seattle.
   The FAA has cautioned against comparing the Aloha incident to
the Continental discover because faulty repair work might be
involved in the Continental case.
   ``The rest of the airplane (away from where the cracks were
found) didn't have any problem (with cracks), and that raises the
suspicion that when the repairs were made they were not done in
accordance with all the procedures that would be prescribed in the
Boeing manual,'' said FAA spokesman John Leyden.

<TEXT>
   A man police call ``a one man crime
wave,'' has admitted to committing 600 to 700 burglaries in the
city over the past two years, authorities say.
   Neil Patrick Green, 32, of Hartford was held in lieu of $32,000
bail and awaited arraignment Wednesday in Superior Court on 50
counts of burglary and 44 counts of larceny.
   ``He was a one-man crime wave,'' said Detective Thomas J. Murphy.
   Police said they have tied Green to 354 burglaries, but they
said the judicial system couldn't handle prosecution in all the
cases.
   Murphy said Green succeeded partly because he was a good actor.
   When a police officer responded to one burglary, Green offered
to help look for the suspect, police said. Another time, he
casually strolled down the sidewalk, bouncing a tennis ball.
   Green once walked past police while carrying stolen speakers and
twice in one month stole a large television set from the same
apartment, officers said.
   ``He tended to believe that if you didn't exhibit an attitude of
guilt, in most cases you'd be able to get away with it,'' said
Murphy.
   Murphy said Green told him that he sold cocaine to finance his
education at Tunxis Community College in Farmington and got hooked
on the drug. But he gave up dealing when he realized police where
cracking down on narcotics dealers and turned to burglary, Murphy
said.
   As Green's cocaine habit grew to $300 a day, he averaged four
burglaries a day, usually in the morning and early afternoon, and
took about $1,000 worth of jewelry, electronic equipment and cash
daily, police said he told them.
   Green admitted to between 600 and 700 burglaries in a written
statement, Lt. Thomas Moore Jr. said. He was arrested Aug. 31
following a tip.

   A federal judge on Wednesday permitted
Iran-Contra prosecutors to drop charges here against a former CIA
agent and seek a new indictment across the Potomac River in
Virginia.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. dismissed a
five-count indictment that charged Joseph F. Fernandez participated
in an illegal conspiracy to help arm Nicaraguan rebels and later
lied to cover up his role in the covert operation.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh sought dismissal in order
to bring the charges anew in federal court in Virginia, where
Fernandez is alleged to have lied to CIA superiors and the
presidential board that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   The defense had sought to quash a new prosecution on the ground
that Walsh had improperly brought charges against Fernandez in
Washington that should have been filed in Virginia.
   But in dismissing the charges without prejudice, Robinson gave
Walsh the opportunity to bring the case before a new federal grand
jury in Alexandria, Va.
   Fernandez, 51, was indicted June 20 on a charge that he
conspired with former National Security Council aide Oliver L.
North and arms dealer Richard V. Secord to set up a clandestine
arms-supply network for the Contra rebels in defiance of a
congressional ban on such aid.
   The alleged conspiracy took place in Washington and elsewhere,
according to the indictment.
   Fernandez, who went by the pseudonym Tomas Castillo when he was
the CIA's station chief in Costa Rica, was also charged with four
counts of lying to his superiors at CIA headquarters in Langley,
Va., about his role in the operation and to the presidential
commission headed by former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas. The
questioning by the Tower Commission also occurred at Langley,
according to the indictment.
   Last month, the defense moved to dismiss the false-statements
and obstruction charges for lack of jurisdiction.
   Walsh countered with a motion to dismiss the entire indictment,
saying he wanted an opportunity to prosecute the entire case in
Virginia.
   Robinson, who had sharply questioned prosecutors about their
tactics at a hearing on Oct. 6, gave no reason for his decision in
the one-sentence order.
   Defense attorney Thomas E. Wilson said he was disappointed that
the judge did not bar further prosecution of Fernandez but added:
``The independent counsel had 18 months to get an indictment
returned and it's been dismssed in three months.''

   ABC's ``Roseanne'' has an unlikely fan _ CBS
President Laurence Tisch, who congratulated his rivals Wednesday
for creating a ``wonderful'' television show.
   Tisch, speaking to the International Radio & Television Society,
said he was ``heartened'' by the show's premiere Tuesday night
because it showed that the three major networks can compete with
cable channels.
   ``It shows you that if we deliver wonderful programs to the
American people, they want to watch network television,'' he said.
   ``Roseanne'' stars comedian Roseanne Barr as a blue collar
housewife who struggles to cope with a husband and three children.
   Tisch, who said he was ``being realistic about the weaknesses in
our prime-time schedule,'' also expressed envy over NBC's
much-scorned ratings for the Summer Olympics.
   ``With all the talk of the poor ratings, I'd love to have those
ratings on CBS,'' Tisch said. CBS recently paid $243 million for
rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics.

<TEXT>
   Le Fouquet's, the famed cafe-restaurant threatened
with closure, on Wednesday was proposed for listing as a historic
monument, a move that should safeguard the high society haunt.
   The Regional Commission for Historic, Archaeological and
Ethnological Patrimony voted overwhelmingly to inscribe the
building housing Le Fouquet's on the Supplementary Inventory of
Historic Monuments and Edifices, the commission announced.
   The measure, which must be formalized within a month, obliges
the landlord to obtain authorization from the Ministry of Culture
for any changes in architecture or decor.
   ``The architecture of Le Fouquet's merits preservation because
it participates elegantly in the urban decor,'' said Culture
Minister Jack Lang.
   Le Fouquet's, located on a prime corner of the Champs Elysees,
is well-known as a gathering place for the rich and famous.
   In July, it announced it might have to close because of a rent
increase by the building's proprietor, a Kuwaiti holding company.
   A committee, fearing a fast-food chain in its place, was formed
to try to save the watering hole.
   The decision by the Regional Commission does not completely
safeguard Le Fouquet's from eventual closure, which can only be
done by ``classifying'' the building, a proposal the Commission
failed to make.
   However, the Culture minister himself can seek to classify the
building if he disagrees with proposed changes.
   Lang said the commission already marked a turning point because
it ruled favorably on a ``place of memories'' rather than a clearly
historic building.
   In other rulings Wednesday, the Commission did propose
classifying Julien, a restaurant in the center of Paris known for
its 1900s decor.
   It proposed inscribing a number of other eating establishments
on the Supplementary Inventory of Historic Monuments. Among them
were: Lipp, on the Boulevard St. Germain; Bofinger, near the
Bastille; and Pharamond, in Les Halles.

   The State Department welcomed on Wednesday
peace initiatives set forth by South Korean President Roh Tae-woo
but said a cautious approach towards North Korea is required
because of that Marxist country's long record of ``state terror.''
   Department spokesman Charles Redman withheld comment on Roh's
specific proposal, which calls for a summit meeting with North
Korean President Kim Il-sung and for a general effort to secure
peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. Roh spoke Tuesday to the
U.N. General Assembly.
   Overall, Redman said, ``we welcome the imaginative and
constructive policy of reconciliation and accommodation that
President Roh is putting forward.''
   He said the specifics of Roh's proposal will be discussed at a
meeting here Thursday between Roh and President Reagan.
   A proposal even more ambitious than Roh's was unveiled Wednesday
at the General Assembly by North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister
Kang Sok Ju, who called for the creation of a new nation out of the
two Koreas with a shared military command.
   Redman reaffirmed that the United States is reviewing its policy
toward North Korea following the resumption of talks between the
two Koreas at Panmunjom and the show of North Korean restraint
during the Seoul Olympics last month.
   There had been concern that North Korea would attempt to disrupt
the Olympic games.
   Redman noted that North Korea remains on the U.S. list of
countries that engage in state-sponsored terrorism and any policy
changes the administration undertakes will not include the removal
of the Pyongyang government from that list.
   ``I would emphasize that North Korea's well-established track
record of belligerence and state terror makes a very cautious
approach to this issue necessary,'' Redman said.
   Among the steps the administration might take, officials said,
is the relaxation of restrictions on diplomatic contact between
U.S. and North Korean officials.
   The Reagan administration reimposed strict limitations last
January following a terrorist incident 11 months ago in which a
South Korean passenger plane was blown up, killing all 115 aboard.
   The administration said evidence of North Korean involvement in
the incident was compelling.
   A State Department official who briefed reporters Tuesday on the
condition of anonymity said the administration ``will probably have
an announcement'' on policy changes toward North Korea a few days
after Thursday's White House meeting.
   ``We certainly want to be responsive to President Roh's policy
changes and what he wants to do,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Former Government Official Accused of War Crimes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Cabinet minister Maurice Papon has been
charged with crimes against humanity stemming from his World War II
service as a local official in Bordeaux, lawyers said.
   Papon, 79, who between 1942 and 1944 was secretary-general of
the Gironde prefecture near the southern city of Bordeaux, later
held many government posts, including police chief of Paris and
budget minister under former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   In the early 1980s, families of Jews deported from the Bordeaux
area accused him of having allowed the arrest of 1,690 Jews who
were sent to Nazi death camps.
   Papon has denied the charges, which were first filed in 1983,
then dismissed last year because of a procedural mistake in the
investigation.
   Gerard Boulanger, lawyer for some of the families, disclosed the
renewed charges, saying they had been filed in July by
Investigating Magistrate Francois Braud, who advised only Papon and
his attorneys.
   Criminal charges in France are not made public, but judicial
sources often tell reporters.
   Lawyers for families of the deportees complained that the Papon
prosecution has been pursued too slowly and in great secrecy.
   ``If the goal is to let him die of old age, that would show a
refusal to judge anti-Jewish actions when it involves respectable
personalities from post-war French society,'' lawyer Serge
Klarsfeld was quoted as saying in the daily Liberation.
   Klarsfeld and his wife, Beate, were responsible for tracking
down Klaus Barbie, known as the ``Butcher of Lyon'' for his
activities as the Gestapo chief of the southern French city. Barbie
was convicted in 1987 of war crimes for the deportation of Jews to
Nazi death camps.

   The USS Wisconsin, the last of four huge
battleships brought back to life by the Reagan administration to
strengthen the Navy, will be recommissioned this weekend during
ceremonies in Mississippi, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   The return to active duty for the 887-foot warship will begin on
Saturday morning at the Ingalls Shipbuilding yards in Pascagoula,
Miss. Former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, will deliver the principal
address during the ceremonies, the Pentagon added.
   The Wisconsin will join three other World War II battleships
that were modernized and returned to service: the Iowa, New Jersey
and Missouri.
   Thanks to the modernization work, the four vessels are
considered among the most powerful surface warships in the world.
   Each of them features nine 16-inch guns, capable of firing
2,700-pound armor-piercing shells up to 23 miles. The battleships
also carry 12 five-inch guns and have been modernized with box
launchers for Tomahawk cruise missiles; canister launchers for
Harpoon missiles; and four Phalanx gatling guns to defend against
aerial attacks.
   The Wisconsin's reactivation began more than two years ago, when
the vessel was taken out of mothballs in Philadelphia in August
1986 and towed to Pascagoula. The ship is 887 feet long, 108 feet
wide and displaces 58,000 tons.
   Its four geared turbines are capable of driving the ship at
speeds in excess of 30 knots.
   The Wisconsin was launched on Dec. 7, 1943, and operated in the
Pacific during World War II with Adm. William F. Halsey's Third
Fleet, earning five battle stars. It was decommissioned in July
1948, but brought back to service again in March 1951 for the
Korean War.
   The ship earned another battle star during that conflict and was
decommissioned again in March 1958.
   It cost $448.8 million to modernize the Wisconsin and return it
to active duty, a figure the Navy describes as a fraction of the
cost of building such a ship from scratch today.
   The Wisconsin will call Norfolk, Va., its home port for now, but
it eventually is to be based at a new Navy base now being built in
Texas. The ship will be sailed by a crew of 1,600.

   Afghan security forces sealed off all streets leading to the
hall where the 140-member Central Committee of the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan met.
   The meeting was expected to begin last week, but Afghan and
foreign sources said the session apparently was delayed by
high-level internal disputes.
   Official sources said on condition of anonymity that the chief
business at the meeting was ``national reconciliation,'' the
government's term for peaceful efforts to halt the fighting between
U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas and Afghan and Soviet troops.
   Afghanistan's state-run television said the Central Committee
dropped two men from the communist party's 13-man Politburo.
Neither was prominent.
   Few details of the arrests of party members were made public in
this country where party and government activities usually are
veiled by official secrecy.
   But one official source said on condition of anonymity that the
arrests were ``due to some opposition activity that they were
launching against the policy of national reconciliation.''
   He said he didn't know how many were arrested or whether they
were members of the Central Committee. Another Afghan source said
the arrests numbered in the dozens, and a Western diplomat said he
had unconfirmed reports that 10 to 15 people were detained.
   The party is divided into two factions: President Najib's
Parcham group and the more hawkish Khalq group headed by Interior
Minister Sayed Mohammad Gulabzhoi. It was not known which faction
those arrested belonged to.
   The Politburo members who dismissed Wednesday were Saleh
Mohammad Zarry, a longtime prominent party member, and Zalour
Razinjo, former Kabul party secretary. Razinjo is about 30 and was
the Politburo's youngest member.
   No replacements were announced.
   Afghan observers said Sarry was associated with the Khalq wing,
while Razinjo had ties with Parcham.
   As Soviet troops withdraw from Afghanistan, ending nine years of
military intervention to prop up the government, Najib increasingly
has tried to portray his government as separate from the party. But
virtually all its non-party members have belonged to
non-threatening loyal opposition groups or are technocrats who
worked with the party in the past.
   Under an accord signed in Geneva in April, all Soviet troops are
to leave Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989. The withdrawal started May
15 and is now half over, with an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 Red
Army soldiers still in Afghanistan.
   Some foreign diplomats say the Soviets may not want major
political upheaval until their withdrawal is over. They say any
change in leadership may be little more than cosmetic.
   The guerrillas' leaders, based in neighboring Pakistan, have
refused to deal with Najib or participate in a coalition government.
   The United States and most other Western countries have refused
to recognize the Kabul government since the Soviet intervention in
1979.
   The guerrillas have continued to rocket Kabul and besiege other
major cities such as Kandahar depite the the Soviet withdrawal.
   Wednesday's rocket attack on Kabul airport closed it to civilian
flights for the rest of the day and for Thursday, said an officer
of Sarandoy, a paramilitary force that guards airport entrances.
   Soviet and Afghan troops continued to operate helicopters and
airplanes from the airport.
   The Sarandoy officer said only one rocket caused casualties. He
said two Soviet women and a Soviet girl of about 2 were killed, and
one Soviet boy was wounded. The rest of the victims were Afghans,
he said.
   The victims were waiting in a tent outside the airport gate for
a flight to Tashkent and Moscow on Ariana, the Afghan airline.

<HEAD>Left-Wing Israeli Legislators Meet With PLO Delegation</HEAD>

   Two left-wing legislators defied Israeli
law and met with a high-ranking PLO delegation in Yugoslavia
earlier this week, the legislators said Wednesday.
   Matityahu Peled and Muhammad Miari, who represent the mixed
Arab-Jewsih Progressive List for Peace, issued a call for an
independent Palestinian state that woulc co-exist with Israel.
   A statement was being issued in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, by the two
legislators and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Peled and Miari told reporters in Tel Aviv that they met in
Belgrade with a PLO delegation headed by top-ranking Mahmoud Abbas,
a member of the organization's executive committee.
   The two Israelis said they recognize the Palestinians
``unquestioned right to self-determination and the establishment of
a sovereign and independent state on the soil of its homeland,
alongside Israel.''
   The statement also accepted ``all United Nations decisions''
that recognize Israel's right to exist and called on Israel to
withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, territories occupied in the
1967 Middle East war.
   An amendment to the anti-terrorist law passed in 1986 bars
Israelis from meeting with PLO representatives and gives violators
prison terms of up to three years.
   In June, four Israelis were sentended to six months in prison
each and fined $2,500 for meeting PLO representatives in Romania in
1986.
   Miari and Peled have parliamentary immunity from prosecution but
the Knesset, Israel's parliament, could vote to strip them of that
privilege.
   Israel radio reported that Avi Farhan, a leader of the
right-wing Tehiya Party, has lodged a complaint with police against
Peled and Miari.
   The two left-wing legislators are running for re-election as
candidates of the Progressive List for Peace, which calls on Israel
to negotiate with the PLO and supports the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state.
   Several other Israelis, including peace activist Abie Nathan,
face charges for meetings with PLO representatives. Nathan recently
held talks with PLO head Yasser Arafat in Tunisia.

   Republican Dan Quayle gave his backroads
campaign a brief urban twist Wednesday and said the GOP is seeking
a ``clear majority'' among traditionally Democratic Jewish voters.
   Quayle met privately with about 15 Jewish backers in Chicago,
emerging to concede ``we haven't done as good a job as we should
have'' among Jewish voters, but said the GOP will ``make inroads''
in that voting bloc.
   Aides said there was no discussion at the closed meeting of
earlier Quayle stumbles while answering questions about the murder
of Jews In World War II.
   In addition, Quayle rejected suggestions that an incident in
which GOP campaign workers were fired for alleged anti-Semitic
leanings had hurt the ticket.
   ``It came up, was brought to our attention and we handled it
with dispatch,'' Quayle told reporters who questioned him about the
dismissals. ``It's over and done with.''
   He insisted the campaign had cleared its name and ``we're not
going to stand for any attitudes like that.''
   The brief campaign stop in Chicago was a departure for Quayle,
who has spent most of his time in smaller towns.
   After meeting with Jewish backers, he briefly toured a job
training site in an ethnic neighborhood in Chicago, before heading
out for a day of stumping across rural Missouri.
   Motorcading across the state, Quayle toured factories and spoke
at schools attacking Democrat Michael Dukakis for a ``dangerous and
naive'' approach to foreign policy.
   Quayle said the GOP would make gains by focusing on pro-Israeli
policies.
   There have been suggestions that growing tensions between blacks
and Jews in the Democratic Party have left an opening for the GOP,
but Quayle wasn't asked to address that issue.
   ``If you look at the numbers, they're not where they should
be,'' Quayle said. ``We're not going to be satisfied until we get a
clear majority and we don't have that right now.''
   Republicans, Quayle said, haven't done their homework in telling
Jewish voters why they should switch from Democrats.
   ``There are a lot of things we have to offer the Jewish
community,'' Quayle said.
   ``Evidently, we haven't done as good a job as we should have in
communicating where the Republican Party is vis-a-vis Israel, where
the Republican Party is vis-a-vis the Jewish community,'' Quayle
said. ``I'll be the first to admit that we've got more work to do.''
   Quayle found himself in the middle of a controversy earlier in
the campaign when he fumbled answers to questions about the
Holocoust during World War II, but he was not questioned about that
incident after Wednesday's meeting.
   In addition, spokesman David Prosperi said ``it did not come
up'' during the meeting.
   ``We had a lot of good issues come forward,'' Quayle said.
   He insisted that it's realistic for Republicans to court Jewish
voters, because that's simply one more group the GOP can bring
under its broadening umbrella.
   ``The bottom line is we are committed to expanding our base and
one of those bases is the Jewish community,'' Quayle said.
   One of the staples of the Quayle campaign is a tour of a job
training site because of his role in crafting legislation which
created training programs.
   On Wednesday, however, he was questioned about the role his
wife, Marilyn, would play in a new administration.
   ``I don't believe she's crossed that bridge yet, or if she has
she hasn't told me,'' said Quayle.
   Mrs. Quayle is spending time this week campaigning in
California, while he stumps the Midwest.
   In Missouri, Quayle stumped in St. Joseph, Liberty, Blue Springs
before heading to Kansas City.
   He has been focusing on building regional ties in the Midwest,
and aides said they planned to continue that theme on Thursday with
yet another bus trip, this one in Ohio.

   An American news photographer said Wednesday
that Israeli soldiers who shot him during a stone-throwing clash
Tuesday were not in physical danger when they opened fire.
   Neal Cassidy, a photographer for the Oakland, Calif.-based
Frontline newspaper, was the first journalist shot in the
10-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   Cassidy, who is in good condition at a hospital in Arab east
Jerusalem, was shot in the right knee with a plastic bullet during
a Palestinian demonstration in Nablus.
   He said soldiers opened fire after a group of five or six
Palestinian youths began shouting and throwing stones at them. He
said the demonstrators were about 150 yards from the soldiers.
   ``That's a pretty good distance,'' Cassidy said from his
hospital bed. ``They were throwing stones in the direction of the
soldiers, but they were too far to reach.
   ``I didn't have the sense that they (the soldiers) were in any
physical danger. There was no physical threat.''
   A photograph Cassidy said he took moments before he was shot
showed five soldiers, one with his gun raised, standing in the
street where the incident took place.
   The photo also showed a young man standing behind the soldiers
preparing to throw a stone.
   Army regulations allow soldiers to open real ammunition fire
only if their lives are in danger. However, trained troopers may
fire plastic bullets for riot dispersal, even if the soldiers are
not endangered.
   An army spokesman said Tuesday that troops fired in Nablus while
being stoned, adding that Cassidy ``endangered himself'' by being
close to the rioters in an area the military had ordered closed to
outsiders.
   A 5-year-old boy and a teen-ager were killed in West Bank
clashes Tuesday.
   Cassidy, 37, of Oakland, said he refused to go to a Jewish
hospital for treatment when Israeli authorities asked him to
transfer from an Arab clinic after the attack.
   ``I told them I had seen enough of their hospitality,'' he said.
``First they shoot me and then they want to take me to their
hospital. I said `No thanks.'''
   On Wednesday, Palestinian patients at the hospital, several of
whom said they were injured in the uprising, visited Cassidy and
exchanged words of support. One Arab patient said: ``This place is
not safe ... it is like Beruit.''
   Cassidy said he has been in the country for about three weeks
working on a story about Palestinians living under Israeli
occupation. He said he will check out of the hospital in a few days
and probably will stay in Israel for another two weeks.

<HEAD>Church Hit by Arson Twice, Black Congregation Vows to Hold Ground</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A church serving a tiny black congregation
has been set afire twice this year, but its pastor vowed Wednesday,
``We're not gonna let anybody force us out.''
   ``Emotions are running a little too high right now,'' said the
Rev. Steven Jackson after a fire Tuesday left only one wall of the
church standing.
   The blaze came just two weeks before the church was scheduled to
reopen, following repairs of damage from an April 16 fire. Both
fires have been attributed to arson. Police have made no arrests.
   Congregation members in the town 30 miles north of St. Louis
probably will rebuild the church a second time on the same spot,
Jackson said, but a final decision will not be made until early
next week.
   ``Tempers could flare. We just need to cool off a little,''
Jackson said.
   ``We need to clear our minds,'' he said, adding there are
``10,000 rumors'' that the fire was racially motivated.
   Area residents reported the blaze shortly before 3 a.m. Tuesday
and the church was engulfed in flames by the time firefighters
arrived. No injuries were reported.
   An FBI agent at the agency's Alton office, who refused to give
her name, said that the agency had entered the investigation to
determine whether the congregation's civil rights had been violated.
   The neighborhood around the church is predominantly white, but
church members said they were unaware of any organized group that
might be behind the fires.
   Jackson said a pipe bomb destroyed the building in 1974.
   ``If it's racially motivated, then somebody is telling us to get
out, and we're not gonna let anybody force us out,'' he said. ``A
lot of the black people who live in the community are kind of hot.''
   Last year the church was defaced with racial epithets, said Lt.
Dennis Fischer of the Madison County Sheriff's Department.
   Police haven't ruled out racism as a factor in the fires, but
``it could be just a straight act of vandalism,'' Fischer said.
   ``I don't have any idea why they'd want to burn it down,'' said
Wesley Matlock, 71, whose great-grandparents founded The New Bethel
African Methodist Episcopal Church of Rock Fork in 1863.
   ``Just vandalism or meanness, that's all I can say,'' Matlock
said.
   The 25-member congregation had planned to rededicate the church
Nov. 6, Jackson said, adding worshippers had put about $65,000 into
rebuilding it.
   Rebuilding could start by November, Jackson said, noting the
church was insured.
   It was built ``so people could worship God free and clear. We
ought to have a right in 1988 to worship where we please,'' he said.
   ``Why would somebody want to run us out?''

<HEAD>US Stopped Dealers From Selling Chilean Jets to Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, in cooperation with the
Chilean and Israeli governments, blocked Iran's purchase last
spring of U.S.-built jets in a deal that arms brokers claimed could
have lead to the release of four American hostages, an official
said Wednesday.
   Following policy guidelines set down by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, officials in Washington and at the U.S. Embassy
in Santiago refused to allow the 12-year-old F-5 jets to be
transferred from Chile to Iran, State Department spokesman Charles
E. Redman said.
   The Chilean government, which had bought the planes from the
United States in 1976, was ``up-front'' and the Israelis acted
quickly to stop an Israeli arms merchant from participating in the
scheme, Redman said.
   According to ABC-TV, which broke the story Tuesday night,
Iranians with the approval of parliamentary Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, authorized Raymond Molina, a Cuban-American, to tell
the U.S. government four hostages would be freed if the deal went
through.
   Redman said the hostages were introduced only in the final
stages of a proposal that was rejected under the U.S. policy known
as ``Operation Staunch.'' It seeks to persuade other governments
and private arms dealers not to provide weapons to Iran.
   Two years ago, President Reagan's secret approval of U.S.
missile sales to Tehran _ despite the policy _ set off
congressional and criminal investigations. The idea was to
encourage moderation in Tehran and also bring about the release of
American hostages.
   Nine Americans are being held in Lebanon, according to U.S.
counterterrorism experts, by groups under Iran's influence.
   ABC said the complicated scheme began last December as Iran,
desperate for weapons to use in its war with Iraq, approached the
Chilean government, using a group of arms dealers from Argentina,
Israel and Britain, along with several Iranians living in Europe.
   The deal, which in its original form would have bypassed the
U.S. government, contemplated sending the F-5 jets in pieces by
ship officially to Thailand but in reality to Iran for $170
million, ABC said.
   But after an Iranian team got to Santiago, officers in the
Chilean Air Force ``got cold feet'' and insisted the sale required
U.S. approval, correspondent John McWethy reported.
   Under U.S. law, while the planes belonged to Chile they could
not be transferred to another country without U.S. consent.
   The ABC story said this led to an attempt to obtain the secret
approval of the U.S. government with the assistance of Molina, a
Cuban-American in Key Biscayne, Fla., who had taken part in the
futile U.S.-backed attempt to invade Cuba in 1961.
   To convince the arms dealers that he had useful connections with
the administration, ABC said, Molina sent them signed pictures of
himself with both Reagan and Vice President George Bush.
   However, there is no evidence that Molina, a big contributor to
Republican campaigns, had any contact with the White House or with
Bush's campaign for the presidency, ABC said.
   In New York, Iranian U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati,
said ``We categorically deny the news reported by ABC yesterday. I
tend to believe such sensationalism arises out of the atmosphere of
the American presidential elections. ... Such deals have not been
attempted or sanctioned. The idea of exchanging hostages for
weapons is a bitter and reprehensible idea.''
   According to ABC, Harry G. Barnes, the U.S. ambassador to Chile,
got wind of the complicated scheme and alerted the State Department.
   Redman said Shultz was not involved directly in blocking the
deal. The spokesman said lower-level officials at the department
and in the embassy in Santiago applied his policy.
   ``We're not going to be a party, or arrange in any way, for arms
to be transferred to Iran,'' the spokesman said. ``The hostage
element seems to have come up only briefly and very fleetingly in
the last stages, and it seems to have been raised by the brokers,
not by the Iranians.''
   Redman added: ``And as you can imagine, again, when that issue
was raised, the answer was just as clear: No deals.''
   ABC said the deal never got off the ground despite an approach
by a wealthy Argetine to the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires and then
to Colin Powell, the U.S. national security adviser.
   The CIA neither endorsed nor rejected the proposal, while Powell
apparently never replied, ABC said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, talking to reporters
aboard Air Force One during a presidential campaign tour of Ohio,
said Powell had not been contacted by anyone about the deal.
   Otherwise, Fitzwater said, the ABC report was essentially
correct and was ``an example of private individuals trying to get
into the hostage situation for private gain.''
   ``It is not helping the hostages, it is not helping our
relations in the Middle East and it is very detrimental to our
foreign policy,'' the spokesman said.

   President Reagan crisscrossed Ohio on
Wednesday for George Bush, saying prosperity has caused the middle
class to shrink and ``America doesn't want to go'' where the
Democrats want to take the nation.
   Making several appearances in a state that strategists say
Michael Dukakis must carry to have a chance at the White House,
Reagan said the Democrats have greater problems than ``whether
their candidate is likable.''
   Fifteen times in a 15-minute speech prepared for a Republican
rally at Ohio State University, Reagan used what he calls the ``L''
word _ condemning both Dukakis and en. Howard Metzenbaum as
liberals. Metzenbaum, seeking a third term in the Senate, is
opposed by Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich.
   At the Wood County courthouse in Bowling Green, Reagan said the
Republicans would deal harshly with criminals and would continue
the kind of firm foreign policy that led to a U.S.-Soviet treaty
restricting medium-range nuclear weapons.
   ``Make a false move and the next sound you hear is the clang of
a jail cell slamming shut,'' the president said, boasting that his
administration has appointed judges who ``know the meaning of the
word punishment.''
   Praising the vice president, he said, ``George and I also
believe that a crack dealer with a machinegun who murders a police
officer in the line of duty should receive the death penalty.''
   Reagan said that Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``did
business because he knew we meant business. And we still mean
business.''

   Reagan wound up his day of campaigning with an appearance at a
fund-raising affair for Voinovich in Cincinnati, where he linked
the Cleveland mayor to Bush and said both ``have the same goals
-keeping government off the backs of the American people, keeping
taxes down, and keeping this nation strong and at peace.''
   In his three speeches, Reagan used the word ``liberal'' more
than 50 times. In the original text of his Bowling Green speech,
Reagan was to say that he was opening ``a second front'' designed
to assure election of a Republican Congress ``with the liberal
presidential campaign starting to fall apart.''

   In remarks to reporters aboard Air Force One, campaign chairman
James A. Baker III said ``it is entirely possible there will be''
joint appearances of Bush and Baker.
   In his Columbus speech, Reagan spoke of watching the
presidential candidates' debate.
   ``I don't often feel sorry for liberals, but I came close,'' he
said. ``I couldn't help thinking, the problem with those fellows on
the other side is not camera angles or lighting; it's not whether
their candidate is likable or not.''
   Many analyses of the debate have said that Bush came across as a
more warm, appealing personality than his opponent, the
Massachusetts governor.
   Reagan, however, said the problem the Democrats face is ``that
where they want to take America, America doesn't want to go; that
they're way over there in left field; that they're out of the
mainstream of American politics; and that their policies are
liberal, liberal, liberal.''
   ``You may have heard the liberals talk about a smaller middle
class, and it's true,'' the president said. ``The middle class is
getting proportionately smaller. But not because a greater
proportion of people are poor. That just isn't so. No, because more
people have moved up and become so well off that they're no longer
called middle class.''
   ``Here in Ohio,'' he said, ``we have a Senate race that draws
just the same lines between the liberals and the rest of us as are
drawn in the race for president.''
   The state has 23 electoral votes.

<HEAD>House Approves Emergency Food, Housing, Health Care Package</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday approved legislation
authorizing $1.3 billion for emergency food and housing, health
care, education and other help to the nation's homeless people over
the next two years.
   The bill received a big boost when the Republican presidential
candidate, Vice President George Bush, called for full funding of
the measure during the first debate with the Democratic nominee,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who has called for even more
funding for the homeless.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., a chief sponsor, said, ``This
is a noble start but it is only a start. It won't even address the
temporary needs of the vast majority of the homeless.
   ``There needs to be permanent housing for the homeless,'' he
said. ``The only way to alleviate the needs of the men, women and
children who are homeless is to build permanent housing and this
bills does not do it.
   ``This bill is a Band-Aid,'' Schumer said, ``A needed Band-Aid,
but not a cure.''
   The House approved the measure on a voice vote. The measure
still must win Senate approval before it is sent to the White House.
   The House-passed bill would authorize $633.8 million for fiscal
1989, which began Oct. 1, for which $378 million has been
appropriated. In fiscal 1990, $682.8 million would be authorized.
   Congress authorized $616 million for fiscal 1988, but a lesser
$360.5 million was appropriated.
   Advocates for the country's homeless population _ estimated at
between 250,000 and 3 million people _ have been angry because so
far, the government has not fully financed the legislation.
   The legislation, known as the McKinney bill, would extend for
two years a law passed early last year.
   The measure is named after the late Rep. Stewart B. McKinney,
R-Conn., one of the original sponsors of the bill. McKinney died on
May 7, 1987, less than three months after the legislation became
law.
   The bill would allow the government to provide money to states
and municipalities, and to private agencies, for rental assistance,
health care, mental health services, alcohol and drug abuse
programs, education and job training projects.
   Funds would be available for the purchase and rehabilitation of
group homes. In addition, unused space at Veterans Administration
hospitals would be set aside for the treatment of homeless veterans.

earlier expectations but still could rise enough to be at a record
level in 1988, an Agriculture Department report said Wednesday.
   Part of the slowdown was attributed to higher feed costs
resulting from the smaller drought-reduced grain harvests.
   Milk output declined in 1987 to 142.5 billion pounds from a
record 143.4 billion pounds in 1986. This year's production was
forecast last spring to rise 2 percent to 3 percent from 1987.
   But the department's Economic Research Service said in its new
outlook report that 1988 milk production may increase only ``around
1 percent'' from last year's level, but could still exceed the
record level of two years ago.
   ``Milk cow numbers have slipped since January and were almost 1
percent below a year ago in July-September,'' the report said.
``Meanwhile, milk (production) per cow posted a moderate 2 percent
rise from a year ago. Both milk per cow and milk cow numbers are
expected to weaken further.''
   The report added that the effects of the higher feed costs next
year ``will be magnified because milk production was already easing
when the drought began'' as a result of a series of cuts in
government supports.
   ``If crops are good (next year) and feed prices decrease,
production probably will strengthen as 1989 progresses,'' the
report said. ``However, 1989 milk production might not match the
1988 record.''
   The seasonal rise in retail prices of dairy products in the
second half of this year ``will be larger than in recent years,''
the report said. ``Even so, the increase will not be out of line
with increases in prices of all food or all items.''
   Overall, it said, consumer prices of milk and other dairy
products in 1988 will probably average about 2 percent more than in
1987.

<HEAD>House Sends Reagan Bill on Disclosure of Credit Card Data</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday approved and sent to
President Reagan a bill requiring issuers of credit and charge
cards to give consumers more and earlier details about the interest
rates and other costs.
   Approval came on a voice voice. The Senate also had passed the
measure by voice vote without discussion last week.
   The legislation requires card issuers, such as banks and
department stores, to disclose their interest rates, fees and grace
periods at the time on applications and solicitations. Supporters
said this will enable consumers to shop around for the least
expensive product.
   Under current law, creditors are not required to disclose the
information until the card is issued.
   Donald G. Oglivie, executive vice president of the American
Bankers Association, said in a statement after the House acted:
``The bill is a victory for both consumers and creditors who will
benefit from balanced disclosure information.''
   More than 100 million people in the United States hold more than
800 million credit cards and have outstanding balances approaching
$150 billion. Solicitations total more than 2.5 billion annually.
   The measure was endorsed by such consumer groups as Consumers
Union, Consumers Federation of America, Bankcard Holders of America
and a coalition of business and industry groups, in addition to the
ABA, Consumer Bankers Association, Coalition of Credit Card
Issuers, National Retail Merchants Association, American Express
Co. and Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   During House debate last Thursday, Rep. Fernand J. St Germain,
D-R.I., Banking Committee chairman, called the measure ``one of the
most important and strongest credit disclosure acts that we have
been able to move through the Congress since the first
truth-in-lending statute was passed 20 years ago.''
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., the measure's chief House
sponsor, said, ``The bill does pre-empt state laws, but that is
immaterial. It is tougher than any state law.''
   Under the legislation, individual states cannot enact laws more
strict than the federal statute.
   However, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the Banking
Committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, was displeased with the
state pre-emption. He said the measure does not go far enough to
protect consumers.
   ``Let me suggest that what Americans want in their credit cards
is not more disclosure, but lower interest rates on their
charges,'' he said. ``There is nothing in this legislation that
will cause credit interests to fall.''

   Mayor Johnny Ford was attacked by two
stray pit bulldogs while jogging behind his home Wednesday morning
and took refuge in a tree for 2{ hours before a passer-by came to
his aid and shot the dogs with a pistol.
   ``I battled them with my hands and feet by using karate kicks as
best I could to keep them at bay,'' Ford said. ``The dogs were so
vicious they momentarily turned on each other and that gave me time
to get to a tree.''
   Ford said he was bitten on the legs, arms and hands. He was
later treated at a hospital and released.
   ``I'm OK,'' Ford said. ``I'm not bitten up that bad. The most
important thing is they were not rabid.'' He said the dogs were
tested by a local veterinarian after they were killed.
   Ford said after the dogs were shot he beat them with a limb
until they were dead.

   A district court judge was shot and
killed Wednesday in her chambers by her estranged husband, an
off-duty police officer, who fired at other officers before
surrendering, police said.
   District Judge Carol Irons, 40, the county's first female judge,
was pronounced dead moments after her husband went to her chambers
to discuss personal matters, said Grand Rapids Police Chief William
Hegarty.
   ``Judge Irons came out of her chambers bent over with her hands
reaching for her throat, asking ... `Please, help me,''' Hegarty
said. Clarence Ratliff, 53, a 21-year veteran of the police force,
followed her and fired at least two or three more shots.
   Ratliff then barricaded himself in her chambers, the police
chief said, exchanging gunfire briefly with three police officers
before surrendering.
   Hegarty said it was unknown whether the weapon was Ratliff's
police-issued revolver. Ratliff was not on duty and went to the
court in street clothes. He was working as a night patrol officer
and previously had been a detective, said the police chief.
   Ratliff had no history of mental problems and there was no
reason to believe Irons feared her husband, Hegarty said. They had
been married four years and were in divorce proceedings. It was the
second marriage for both. They had no children together, although
Ratliff has children from a previous marriage.
   ``When she told me she was filing for divorce, she mentioned she
thought the worst of it was over and thought it would be much
easier from then on ... but there were no indications that there
was any violence in their marriage or that she was fearful of
him,'' said Judge Donald Johnston, chief district court judge, who
married the two outside the justice hall.
   Johnston said he spoke with Irons moments before the shooting
and that she appeared fine.
   Irons called the police dispatcher on an intercom at 12:07 p.m.
and said her estranged husband held a weapon to her head, the
police chief said.
   Officers responded quickly because the police department is
adjacent to the Hall of Justice. They dragged the judge, who was
shot at least once in the throat, to a jury room and then across
the hall to a courtroom.
   The courthouse was evacuated during the brief standoff, and
Chief District Judge Donald Johnston closed all court proceedings
for the rest of the day.
   Irons, of Grand Rapids, was elected in 1982 as the first female
judge in the county. She was running unopposed for re-election this
fall.
   Before becoming judge she was an assistant county prosecutor.
Irons frequently hosted school classes in her courtroom and was
proud of her role as a model for young women.
   ``I think schoolgirls ought to have professional women as role
models,'' she said in a 1985 interview with The Grand Rapids Press.

<HEAD>Three Contractors To Vie For New Space Booster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENT, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three defense contractors are about to embark
on a two-year, high-stakes competition to develop an unmanned space
rocket for the Air Force, industry officials say.
   ``Whoever wins this business is certainly going to be at the
forefront of the U.S. launch business for a long time to come,''
said Vince Caluori, Boeing Aerospace's manager here for the program
the Air Force calls the Advanced Launch System.
   Initial development contracts will be awarded ``any day now'' to
Boeing, Martin Marietta Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., Air Force
spokesman Capt. Marty Hauser said earlier this week.
   He would not confirm reports that each contract could be for $80
million.
   The Air Force wants a lightweight family of launch vehicles that
can slash the cost of putting payloads in space. Under the
development contracts, each company will have 25 months to submit
plans to build a system that will meet the Air Force requirement of
lifting up to 160,000 pounds of payload to an equatorial or polar
orbit.
   The winner of the development competition can expect billions of
dollars in business in the 1990s, as the Air Force moves toward a
first launch of the ALS late in that decade.
   ``What ALS represents to us is really the whole next generation
of launch vehicles,'' said Jeff Fisher, spokesman for Martin
Marietta's Denver-based astronautics group. ``To stay in this
business in the long term, ALS is critical.''
   The Martin Marietta division, teamed with McDonnell Douglas
Astronautics Co. for the competition, developed much of the Titan
launch system for civilian and military satellites, a business that
has generated more than $4 billion.
   Also hungry for the work is General Dynamics Space Systems
Division of San Diego, which developed the upper-stage rockets for
Titan, and the Atlas missile systems.
   ``It's a very, very significant program,'' said General Dynamics
spokesman Jack Isabel. ``It's comparable to when the space shuttle
got under way.''
   Boeing worked on the Saturn rocket booster for the Apollo manned
space missions, Minuteman missiles, and the upper-stage booster for
satellites launched from the space shuttle. Still, it's been 15
years since the Saturn program ended, a long time to be out of the
space rocket business.
   ``Both our competitors have to be viewed as incumbents,''
Caluori said. ``We think it's going to be one of the toughest
competitions down the road that we've been involved in.''
   Boeing so far has released one possible design, featuring a
winged vehicle and booster rocket launched with six
liquid-propellant engines. The vehicle would use four aircraft
engines to land back on earth.
   General Dynamics' initial design calls for an all-liquid
hydrogen and oxygen powered vehicle and booster rocket without
wings. Martin Marietta has released three designs, including
all-expendable and partly recoverable versions.
   The Air Force's goal is to make rocket launches as predictable
as airplane flight, Caluori said.
   The explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and other
payload-launching setbacks have left the United States with a large
backlog of satellites waiting to be put into orbit. As a result,
some companies have turned to foreign launchers such as Europe's
Ariane system.

   Three Americans won the Nobel Prize in
physics Wednesday for their work with subatomic particles, and
three West Germans shared the chemistry prize for discoveries that
may be critical in harnessing the sun's energy.
   Americans Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger
shared the physics prize for capturing neutrinos in a high energy
beam to probe the stucture of atomic particles.
   Chemists Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber and Hartmut Michel of
West Germany were honored for their work in unraveling a mystery of
photosynthesis. They were rewarded for work completed only three
years ago, indicating the importance attached to their breakthrough
by the awarding committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
   Many recipients wait decades for recognition.
   Committee chairman Bo Malmstrom said their work was an essential
step toward artificial photosynthesis, which scientists hope will
provide the key to converting the sun's energy to man's needs.
   ``The only way in the long run to solve the energy problem of
the world is to utilize solar energy,'' Malmstrom said.
   Although it had no immediate practical application, the academy
said the research had importance beyond the study of
photosynthesis, the process of converting sunlight into energy.
   It said the research could be used in understanding central
biological functions, including the transport of chemical
substances between cells, hormone action and nerve impulses.
   The physics award also was for basic research with no practical
use as yet, said Bengt Nagel, secretary of the academy's physics
committee.
   ``Some day, some kid who is now in high school will find out how
to use this information to bring benefits to all of society,'' said
Lederman.
   The physicists discovered a way to concentrate neutrinos by the
hundreds of billions into a beam capable of probing the inner parts
of protons in the same way an X-ray penetrates the human body, the
academy said.
   Neutrinos are extremely tiny particles _ even on the subatomic
scale _ with no electrical charge. They interact very weakly with
other forms of matter and could easily pass through a layer of lead
trillions of miles thick without being diverted from their course,
according to the Nobel citation.
   ``The work was the first pioneering effort to essentially put
together an experiment in which neutrinos ... which very rarely
interact in matter at all ... interact,'' said Schwartz, awakened
with the news at his home in San Francisco.
   The physicists also were cited for discovering the muon neutrino.
   The academy said their work ``opened entirely new opportunities
for research into the innermost structure and dynamics of matter.''
   Schwartz, 55, who left physics to run his own company
specializing in computer communication, came up with the idea to
use a neutron beam to study radioactive decay after other types of
beams failed to work.
   Schwartz once wrote that he discussed the problem with some
colleagues during a coffee break in 1959, but they were left
stymied.
   ``That night it came to me. It was incredibly simple. All we had
to do was to use neutrinos,'' he wrote in a scientific journal.
   The prize-winning experiment ``was completed and published in
1961. Those poor guys in Stockholm have been puzzling over it ever
since and finally decided it was good stuff,'' said Lederman, 66,
director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia,
Ill.
   Steinberger, 67, a German-born naturalized American, said he had
given up hope of winning.
   ``It was not such that you immediately had to give it a Nobel
Prize. I would have thought it would be honored that way at one
time or another, but I had given up,'' he said in an interview at
the CERN research laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, where he works.
   The three were faculty members at Columbia University at the
time of their research.
   Deisenhofer, Huber and Michel were cited ``for the determination
of the three-dimensional structure of a photosynthetic reaction
center.''
   The work led to better understanding of photosynthesis not only
in bacteria, but in algae and higher plants as well, the academy
said.
   In 1982, Michel was able to obtain proteins in a crystalline
form that allowed their structure to be determined. The scientists
worked together to determine their structure.
   Deisenhofer, 45, studied at the Max Planck Institute for
Biochemistry. He now works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
in Dallas.
   Huber, 51, is still at the Max Planck institute in Martinsried,
West Germany. Michel, 42, works at the Max Planck Institute for
Biophysics in Frankfurt.
   The chemistry and physics prizes completed the awarding of the
six 1988 Nobel prizes. Each carries a $390,000 award.
   The U.N. peacekeeping forces won the peace prize, Egyptian
novelist Naguib Mahfouz took the literature prize, and French
economist Maurice Allais won the economics prize.
   American researchers Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitzhings
shared the medicine prize with Sir James W. Black of Britain.

   North Korea proposed Wednesday the
creation of a neutral Korean nation in which the socialist north
and capitalist south would peacefully co-exist in a confederation.
   Meanwhile, South Korean President Roh Tae-woo pledged Wednesday
to pursue better relations with China, the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe to help free North Korea from its international isolation.
   North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kang Sok Ju, told the
43rd U.N. General Assembly that the new nation his country was
proposing would ``realize national reunification leaving the two
social systems in the North and the South as they are.''
   ``There is no hidden attempt to insinuate `unification through
Communization' and no intention to impose our ideas and system on
the other side,'' Kang said.
   South Korea's U.N. Mission did not directly respond to the
proposal. It said in a statement, ``Our president (Roh Tae-woo)
yesterday suggested all those proposals of North and South Korea be
discussed at the summit talks between the two parts of Korea.''
   Speaking before the General Assembly on Tuesday, Roh said that
before reunification could occur, mutual trust between the nations
must be established.
   Roh also proposed the two Koreas meet with United States, Soviet
Union, China and Japan to prepare the groundwork for peace and
security measures throughout northeast Asia.
   In prepared remarks for a speech to the Council on Foreign
Relations and the Asia Society, said Wednesday in New York, ``We do
not seek to isolate North Korea. We hope that the improvement and
expansion of our relations with socialist countries will stimulate
North Korea into opening itself up to the outside world and
responding positively to our call for reconciliation and
cooperation.''
   The new Korea, which Kang called ``the Democratic Confederal
Republic of Koryo,'' would have a supreme national assembly with an
equal number of representives from north and south. However, he did
not provide details of how two such different social systems might
be melded successfully into one nation.
   Kang said the proposal was first suggested by North Korea's
President Kim Il Sung in 1980 and reiterated last September.
   Koryo was one of three nations on the Korean peninsula 600 years
ago. It preceded the Lee dynasty that unified the three countries
and lasted 500 years before Japan annexed Korea.
   The Korean peninsula was again divided at the end of World War
II, when the Soviets ended Japanese occupation in the north and the
Allies landed in the south. North and South Korea are still
technically at war because the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an
armistice with no peace treaty signed.
   Kang said the new Koryo would abolish former military alliances
and treaties, maintain a unified military command, and dissolve the
demarcation line dividing north from south at the 38th Parallel.
   The new nation would also be the sole representative of the
entire peninsula in diplomatic relations with other nations and
hold the sole Korean seat in the United Nations, he added. Both
Koreas currently hold non-voting observer status in the General
Assembly.
   He also said the United States and North Korea should sign a
peace agreement that would result in the withdrawal of U.S. troops
from the south, a phased demilitarization of the peninsula, and
establishment of a nuclear-free zone. He reiterated North Korea's
longstanding position that presence of about 42,000 U.S. troops
hinders reunifiction.
   He said the new nation should remain neutral in world politics
and ban the presence of all foreign troops on its territory.
   Kang said the leaders of the North and South must discuss the
confederation concept at any summit.
   Vernon Walters, the permanent U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, said of Kang's speech: ``I don't think there were any new
elements except the tone; the tone was considerably more
conciliatory.''
   On Thursday, Roh is scheduled to meet President Reagan in
Washington. The South Korean leader is expected to ask Washington
to improve its relations with North Korea.

   A suicide car bomb exploded Wednesday
near Israel's ``Good Fence'' border crossing in south Lebanon,
killing seven Israeli soldiers and wounding eight others and two
Lebanese civilians, the military command said.
   In Beirut, the Islamic Resistance claimed responsibility. The
same coalition of pro-Iranian fundamentalist groups claimed
responsibility for a car bomb that wounded three Israelis in August.
   The military wing of Hezbollah, the Party of God militia based
in Beirut, also claimed responsibility, according to Middle East
Television, a Christian-run station. Hezbollah belongs to Islamic
Resistance.
   The TV report, monitored in Metulla, said, ``The car bomb tore
apart a minibus full of soldiers.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other Israeli leaders vowed to
retaliate.
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, head of Israel's northern command, told a
news conference the bomb exploded 300 yards north of the border at
1:25 p.m. (7:25 a.m. EDT) as two groups of army vehicles passed
each other, one headed home and the other into Lebanon.
   Peled said the blast was so powerful ``nothing remained of the
car bomb.''
   An Israeli officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
white Toyota truck, driven by an Arab ``apparently from
Hezbollah,'' exploded amid two convoys totaling seven vehicles.
   ``The commanders got out to talk. The Toyota came in between the
two groups of vehicles and exploded,'' he said.
   The blast left a crater more than 15 feet wide. Witnesses said
they saw pools of blood. Trees were scorched.
   Witnesses said the attack vehicle was unrecognizable.
   Israel created the ``Good Fence'' in 1976 to provide medical and
other aid to refugees from Lebanon's civil war. It is used today
mostly by Lebanese workers who travel to Israel daily.
   Villagers in south Lebanon told reporters the suicide driver
stopped his vehicle and asked an Israeli soldier for a light.
``When he saw Israeli vehicles, he reached inside ... and set off
the bomb,'' one said.
   Some Israeli army officials noted that the driver's body was not
found and said there were indications a remote-control device
triggered the explosion.
   Peled told reporters, ``We must talk to the survivors to
ascertain what happened. What we know is that the car was
apparently not parked, and when the army vehicles arrived, the
vehicle also arrived and exploded.''
   Israel television said six army jeeps and a minibus were
involved. It showed pictures of charred and heavily damaged
vehicles. U.S.-made M-16 assault rifles lay in a heap, surrounded
by vehicle parts.
   Reporters arriving later were barred from entering Lebanon but
saw a soldier guarding a charred truck and jeep.
   The soldier and TV cameramen said the blast knocked down a
section of the electronic fence.
   Israel television quoted army experts as saying the bomb
contained up to 330 pounds of explosives and apparently was readied
in a south Lebanese village.
   The blast was heard four miles away and broke windows in the
small border town of Metulla.
   Scott MacDonald, an employe of the Christian-run Voice of Hope
radio station, said ``I felt the explosion as I was walking in the
house and a saw a blast of wind. The explosion was at least a mile
away so it was pretty powerful.''
   Tour groups visit the ``Good Fence'' site regularly, and
witnesses said Australian youths were at the fence shortly before
the blast. None was harmed.
   TV film showed medical teams performing emergency surgery in the
field and victims with arms and legs blown off.
   ``The soldiers who were slightly wounded began to rescue their
comrades. It was amazing, they did it under fire as ammunition and
grenades were exploding around,'' a civilian security officer from
Metulla said on Israel radio.
   Wounded soldiers were flown by helicopter to Israeli hospitals.
The army said one was in critical condition. Peled said two
Lebanese women were hurt.
   Shamir vowed that ``Israel's just and secure hand will reach the
killers,'' the television reported.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said: ``Those sending suicide
drivers in car bombs should know they will pay the bill till the
end.''
   Rabin and Peled said the incident proved nevertheless the value
of Israel's self-declared security zone, a buffer strip six to 10
miles deep in south Lebanon.
   ``That it happened so close to the border proves the importance
of the security zone,'' Peled said.
   The last major car bomb attack occurred yards from Metulla's
border fence on March 10, 1985, shortly before most Israeli troops
were withdrawn after three years of occupation. That attack,
claimed by the pro-Syrian Lebanese Syrian Socialist Nationalist
Party, killed 12 Israeli soldiers and wounded 14.
   Hezbollah has been demanding stepped up action to force Israel
to withdraw its remaining troops from south Lebanon.

<HEAD>Illinois GOP Brochure Says Criminals Will Vote For Dukakis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUINCY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Republican brochures denounced Wednesday
by Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis were distributed
by the Illinois GOP.
   One of them bore the headline, ``All the Murderers and Rapists
and Drug Pushers and Child Molesters in Massachusetts Vote for
Michael Dukakis,'' and the second one contained a similar message
but bore a less inflammatory headline, ``Vote for Vice President
George Bush for President.''
   The first brochure alleged that convicts in Massachusetts have
the right to vote.
   It cited Dukakis' opposition to the death penalty and his
support for the controversial Massachusetts prison furlough program.
   The brochure alleged that Dukakis has said that if the death
penalty were reinstituted in Massachusetts by popular vote he would
commute death sentences.
   It said the Massachusetts governor supports allowing convicts to
vote and vetoed a bill to stop letting convicts out of prison on
weekend passes.
   The second brochure cited the Massachusetts furlough program and
specifically the case of Willie Horton, the furloughed convicted
who raped a Maryland woman. It said that convicted Illinois
mass-murderer ``would be eligible for weekend passes''' under the
Massachusetts program.
   The material also touched on Social Security, saying that Bush
would never raid the trust fund as alleged by Dukakis and
contending that the Massachusetts governor ``has taken huge sums of
money from the Massachusetts pension funds to balance the state
budget.''

<HEAD>Teamsters Union Says Endorsement Includes Bush and Quayle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters on
Wednesday clarified that it is endorsing Republican Sen. Dan Quayle
of Indiana for vice president along with its endorsement of George
Bush for president.
   ``We support Bush and Quayle like ham and eggs,'' said Teamster
President William J. McCarthy.
   McCarthy had announced Monday that the union was endorsing the
Republican ticket on the basis of a poll answered by 21,207 union
members showing they favored Bush over Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis 50.2 percent to 46.4 percent.
   In a news conference held during a meeting of the union's
18-member executive board at Grenelefe, Fla., he said that he
personally also favored Bush.
   But when pressed by reporters on whether he also favored Quayle
over Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, McCarthy
responded, ``Look, I'm not going to talk about Quayle or
(President) Reagan or anybody else,'' according to Teamster
officials.
   That remark had been widely misinterpreted as an endorsement of
Bush but not Quayle.
   Tim O'Neill, a spokesman for the union, said a questionnaire on
presidential preferences sent to 1.6 million Teamster members last
month had boxes for checkmarks listing only Bush and Quayle
together and Dukakis and Bentsen together.
   The Teamsters had endorsed Reagan and Bush in both the 1980 and
1984 elections.
   But officials in the union had not expected a Teamster
Republican presidential endorsement this year because of the 1986
indictment of then-Teamsters President Jackie Presser and a Justice
Department suit in June seeking to place the union under a
court-appointed trustee.
   ``I was just as surprised as anybody,'' one top Teamster
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
``Before Monday's meeting, there was no indication that any board
members would vote that way.''
   Not all of them did, according to other sources close to the
union.
   One, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the vote by
the 18-member executive board on endorsing Bush and Quayle was 11-7.
   At least five Teamster board members had actively worked on
behalf of Dukakis.
   Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis, before he was upset by
McCarthy in a bid for the Teamsters' presidency upon Presser's
death last July, had spoken in favor of Dukakis on several
occasions.
   However, McCarthy, the Teamsters' top official in Boston for 20
years before taking over from Presser, had made no secret of a
dislike he had developed for Dukakis during his 10 years as
Massachusetts' governor.
   Teamster vice presidents and board members Daniel Ligurotis and
Donald Peters, both of Chicago, Don West of Birmingham, Ala., and
Michael Riley of Los Angeles had also supported Dukakis.
   Meanwhile, Federal Election Commission records show that the
Teamsters have given Bentsen $9,000 in campaign funds this year in
his simultaneous race for re-election to the Senate from Texas.
   But the union also gave Quayle $5,000 in campaign funds two
years ago when he was seeking re-election to the Senate.

   Fire officials on Wednesday searched a Head
Start center Wednesday after an unidentified caller claimed a bomb
was planted in a building where Barbara Bush was visiting, police
said.
   No bomb was found in the center on the city's western edge.
   Public safety director Mike Phelan said the bomb threat was made
to a dispatcher for the city's 911 emergency system by a male who
did not identify himself. Sikeston, a city of about 20,000 in
southeastern Missouri, is located 120 miles south of St. Louis.
   ``I think it was just a prank. No bomb was found. She was not
upset whatsoever,'' Phelan said of the incident. ``She handled it
very calmly and very professionally.''

<TEXT>
   The leaders of three major Jewish
organizations, seeking to heal a public rift, pledged their support
Wednesday to the most prominent pro-Israel lobbying group and said
they were not planning a rival operation.
   The American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress and
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith had complained earlier
that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) had taken
positions that were not in accord with ``the consensus of the
organized Jewish community.''
   The complaint, in a letter that appeared initially in a story in
The New York Times, said the three organizations had established
``a joint political committee'' for Israel in Washington.
   However, the joint statement Wednesday said ``the implication''
in the story that they ``are contemplating the establishment of a
lobbying operation in Washington that would operate independently
of AIPAC is entirely incorrect.''
   The statement was signed by Ira Silverman, executive vice
president of the American Jewish Committee; Harry Siegman,
executive director of the American Jewish Congress; and Abraham H.
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League.
   ``Our three organizations, each of which has had offices in
Washington for many years, are founding members of AIPAC, have been
fully supportive of its work and will continue to support it,'' the
letter said.
   ``The new procedures we have established in Washington are
intended to improve coordination between our agencies and AIPAC in
developing policy'' that ``will be consistent with the consensus''
of American Jewish groups, it said.
   ``The purpose of this improved coordination is to enhance
AIPAC's effectiveness, not provide any alternative to it,'' the
letter said. ``We expect AIPAC to participate fully in that
coordinating process.''
   Foxman, in an Associated Press interview Tuesday, described as
``hogwash'' the idea that the hard-line stance of AIPAC was the
issue.
   ``We're united how we feel about the PLO,'' Foxman said.
   But the Jewish leader said AIPAC was mistaken to try to force
the closing of the Palestine Liberation Organization's U.N. office
in New York.
   And, Foxman said, while there was widespread opposition to a
U.S. missile sale to Kuwait, it was poor strategy for AIPAC to try
to persuade Congress to block the purchase.
   Meanwhile, Seymour Reich, the president of B'nai B'rith, who did
not sign the letter, expressed ``deep concern over the public
expression of disunity in the Jewish community with regard to
Washington-based lobbying activity.''
   He said disagreements among the organizations ``is best solved
by individuals _ not through a public airing in the media.''
   Reich criticized the Jewish leaders who called in the letter for
establishment of ``a joint political committee'' for Israel in
Washington.
   ``Efforts to create a competing lobbying bloc gives the mistaken
impression that the community has no consensus on peace in the
Middle East,'' he said.
   A senior official of AIPAC told The Associated Press in a
separate interview Tuesday that ``this whole episode is bound to
confuse members of Congress.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity from Los
Angeles, where the group held a board meeting, said ``more
consultation is always desirable'' among Jewish groups.
   He said AIPAC leaders would meet in Washington with the critics
on Nov. 3.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seek Assurance From Reagan Over Safety of Weapons
Reactors</HEAD>

   Twelve lawmakers worried that the nation's
nuclear deterrent may be compromised by safety problems at U.S.
weapons plants asked President Reagan on Wednesday to reassure
Congress the facilities are being operated safely before their
reactors are restarted.
   ``Unless we solve the current problems at U.S. defense
production facilities like Savannah River, we will provide the
ultimate unilateral concession _ the unilateral disarming of our
nuclear deterrent,'' said one of the 12, Rep. Bill Clinger, R-Pa.
   The Energy Department shut the only active weapons reactor at
the Savannah River plant near Aiken, S.C., in August after the
plant operator, Du Pont Co., ignored an unexplained power surge
while restarting the reactor.
   The department has said it plans to start one of the three
operable reactors in December or January, after completing safety
reviews and improvements, with the other two following later in
1989.
   In a letter to Reagan, the 12 lawmakers said ``Restoration of
safe operations and reliable production are essential to the
defense and security of our nation.''
   There were these other developments Wednesday in the nuclear
weapons manufacturing story:
   _Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee and a longtime critic of the department's weapons
production activities, said he did not agree with a call by Gov.
Richard Celeste of Ohio to close the Fernald, Ohio, uranium
processing plant. Recent congressional testimony revealed that the
department for years had told contractors to ignore environmental
pollution there.
   The plant is closed by a strike. On a visit to Ohio on
Wednesday, Reagan was asked whether the plant should stay closed.
``I have word from the secretary of energy that the plant will not
be opened unless it's absolutely safe,'' Reagan said.
   _Energy Secretary John Herrington said the department plans
further increases in its cleanup budget, which doubled to $1.5
billion this year. In appearances on NBC-TV and CBS-TV morning news
shows, Herrington said safety and environmental protections were
adequate but not up to modern requirements.
   _The Natural Resources Defense Council wrote Herrington that it
would sue to prevent the Savannah River reactor restart unless he
pledged by Nov. 11 to compile an environmental impact statement.
The department said it believed no statement was required.
   The three reactors can produce either plutonium or tritium, and
only tritium is currently needed for weapons. Tritium decays
rapidly, with 5.5 percent of any amount turning into inert helium
each year. The pace of replenishment and the state of tritium
inventories is secret, but some officials have said there is a
nine-month supply of tritium in the pipeline.
   Recent congressional testimony by DOE safety officials has
revealed a 30-year history of mishaps at Savannah River, often not
communicated to the department, and a disregard of safety among
department managers.
   The signers of the letter to the president _ Glenn, Clinger and
10 members of the House, including three committee chairmen _ asked
Reagan to direct the department not to operate the reactors until
the department's new Advisory Committee on Nuclear Safety
``concludes that public health and safety will be adequately
protected during reactor operations'' and reported that conclusion
to Congress.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., and chairman of the Government
Operations environment subcommittee, said ``Currently, the
department is not in control of its own defense complex. DOE is, in
effect, a captive of its own contractors.''
   The department relies on contractors to operate its 16 major
plants at 13 sites. Synar said no one was objecting to the use of
contractors if properly supervised.
   The letter asked that the department present a plan within 90
days showing how it will ``reestablish management control and
authority over operating contractors ... establish clear lines of
communication and authority ... and resolve current ambiguities
over responsibilities for safety.''
   As for closing the Fernald plant, Glenn said, ``I disagreed with
that.'' Right now, he said, the plant can be operated safely, and
``If you close that plant down, it'll probably get less attention,
not more.''
   Energy Department spokesman Will Callicott said the department
believed Fernald had been improved to the point at which
``operations pose no significant threat to the environment or to
public health.''
   Restarting the Savannah River reactors, the Natural Resources
Defense Council argued, is clearly the sort of ``major federal
action'' that requires an environmental impact statement. In 1983,
the department won such a suit requiring a statement before the
reactivation of one of the Savannah River reactors after a decade.
That statement took 10 months to write.
   Thomas Cochran, the council's nuclear weapons expert, said there
were several dodges the department could use to stretch the tritium
supply.
   Doubling the nine-month pipeline supply could be achieved by
recharging the weapons to only seven-eighths of capacity, he said.
This would not degrade the power of the weapon, but would require
another recharge sooner, he said. Delaying recharge of other
weapons for a year and scavenging weapons coming out of service
could yield further supplies with only ``negligible impact'' on
military power, Cochran said.
   Callicott said of the Synar letter, ``We will not operate unsafe
reactors,'' the advisory committee ``will review restart
activities'' and the department ``intends to keep Congress advised
throughout the process.''
   He said he believed no environmental impact statement was
required to restart the reactors.
   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper said the letter had not been
received there, and he would defer to the department's comments.
   In Wilmington, Del., Du Pont vice president John Mulloy, said
the company had not seen the letter, but, ``We have operated the
plant safely for 38 years and have said consistently that we
believe the plant is fully capable of safely producing the material
required to meet the nation's defense needs for the foreseeable
future.''
   In addition to Synar, Glenn and Clinger, the letter was signed
by Democratic Reps. Jack Brooks of Texas; Mo Udall of Arizona; John
Dingell of Michigan; Phil Sharp of Indiana; Dave McCurdy of
Oklahoma; David E. Skaggs of Colorado, Albert Bustamante of Texas
and Norman Dicks of Washington, along with Republican Rep. Frank
Horton of New York.

   The city of Beverly Hills succeeded Wednesday
in having a $200,000 Rolls-Royce auto declared a public nuisance
and barring its owner from parking it in the same Rodeo Drive spot
for more than an hour at a time.
   Five attorneys representing the city convinced Superior Court
Judge Edward Kakita to issue a preliminary injunction against art
gallery owner David Spellerberg and his 1954 Rolls.
   ``This is the first time a Rolls-Royce has been declared a
public nuisance,'' Spellerberg said after the 15-minute hearing.
``Only in Beverly Hills would this happen.''
   Spellerberg has parked the dark blue, chauffeur-driven car in
the one-hour spot in front of his National Heritage Gallery of Fine
Art for the past seven months. His driver stands by, pumping $15 in
quarters into the meter each day.
   ``I just wanted to put glitter and glamour back on the street.
We sure aren't getting that with a Pinto. But the city of Beverly
Hills could care less,'' said Spellerberg. ``Rodeo Drive just isn't
what it used to be.
   ``We're paying $20,000 a month in rent and I can't even park my
own car in front of my own gallery.''
   Spellerberg said he bought the Rolls after noticing that
tourists walking down Rodeo Drive, famous for its posh shops and
celebrity clientele, were frequently heard asking, ``Is that all
there is?''
   Since parking the car in front of the gallery, he said an
estimated 20,000 tourists have posed for snapshots in front of it.
He blames the city's action on jealous business owners nearby.
   The ruling which imposed the one-hour parking limit also compels
Spellerberg to move the car no less than 500 feet. In addition,
Spellergerg cannot block or use the sidewalk for commercial
advertisements or promotions.
   Spellerberg said he isn't giving up his fight, but he won't
disclose his next move.
   ``The city hasn't had any sense of humor in this,'' he said.
``They had five attorneys in there this morning. I want to know
what the taxpayers have to say about that.''

   Nancy Reagan ducked questions on Wednesday
about her borrowed, high-fashion wardrobe, as her spokeswoman
refused to rule out the possibility that she might receive more
free fashions.
   Mrs. Reagan, appearing at a riding center for the handicapped,
refused to speak with reporters attempting to question her about
the latest flap over designer gowns lent her by leading fashion
houses.
   President Reagan denounced the reports, which first appeared in
Time Magazine over the weekend.
   ``I don't have anything to say about that ridiculous story,''
Reagan told reporters as he left the White House for a day of
campaigning in Ohio.
   Mrs. Reagan, queried as she left the National Center for
Therapeutic Riding, only smiled slightly and continued walking as
reporters asked to speak with her.
   White House counsel Fred Fielding informed the Office of
Government Ethics in 1982 that even though the Ethics in Government
Act of 1978 did not require Mrs. Reagan to report the borrowed
material, she would include the information on financial disclosure
forms.
   At that time, Mrs. Reagan also pledged to quit using borrowed
items.
   However, over the weekend, Time Magazine reported that several
fashion designers said they'd continued to lend Mrs. Reagan
expensive clothes since 1982. And neither the first lady nor the
president has since reported the items as gifts or loans on their
financial disclosure and tax forms.
   One Los Angeles designer, David Hayes, was quoted by Time as
saying he'd made some 60 to 80 made-to-order outfits available to
the first lady over the years. She returned more than half and kept
the others, he said.
   A spokeswoman for Hayes, who refused to identify herself, said
he was ``in conference'' on Wednesday and unable to take a phone
call.
   Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman disputed Hayes' account, contending
his number was ``extraordinarily high.''
   ``I haven't seen her wear a David Hayes in five years,'' said
Elaine Crispen.
   Mrs. Crispen also took issue with Hayes' assertion that she
hasn't returned some of the dresses made especially for her. ``All
the items that were borrowed have been returned,'' said Mrs.
Crispen.
   The spokeswoman said she did not know what led the first lady to
break the promise she made in 1982.
   ``I just don't know. She made her own rule ... she broke her own
rule. Perhaps because she was told it wasn't against the law. I
just don't know what her personal thinking was,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   The spokeswoman said she couldn't rule out a continuance of the
practice, however.
   ``I won't rule out that possibility _ that sometime, something
in the future might be borrowed,'' she added.
   Reagan, at the outset of his third and final speech on a
three-city Ohio campaign swing, came to his wife's defense.
   Speaking of the separations and absences caused by political
life, the president said that while he'd like to stay longer, ``I
want to get home to see Nancy.''
   Reagan went on to praise the first lady's ``Just Say No''
anti-drug abuse campaign, and added: ``The government's got quite
an employee there, with no salary.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday ``there is
no legal problem, there is no ethical problem'' for failing to
report the items.
   ``There is no consequence,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater based his statements on statements made earlier in the
week by Donald Campbell, the No. 2 man at the Office of Government
Ethics, who said his agency sees no need at this time to reassess
the 1982 opinion on the matter.

   First lady Nancy Reagan, in hot water again
over borrowed finery, got a good-natured pat on the back Wednesday
from her traveling husband.
   President Reagan, in Cincinnati to make a Republican
fund-raising speech, opened up by saying, ``You know some people
say that politics makes strange bedfellows. I'm going to let you in
on a little secret. Sometimes, politics doesn't make bedfellows at
all.''
   ``And sometimes it separates people that have been bedfellows
for a while.''
   ``Frankly, I have to say I'm a little anxious to get back to
Nancy myself,'' he said.
   ``The government's got quite an employee there in the first
lady, for no salary,'' Reagan added.
   ``I thought I'd like to tell you I'm very proud of her,'' the
president said, going on to speak of Mrs. Reagan's campaign against
drug abuse.
   He made no reference to the controversy over Mrs. Reagan's
admission that she has continued to accept loaned dresses from
designers although she had announced in 1982, after a similar
controversy arose, that she would not.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Trade Charges As Polls Give GOP Good News</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: To UPDATE with ABC-Post poll, SUB three grafs for 15th pvs,

<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis complained bitterly Wednesday that his
record has been distorted by the Republicans and said ``that seems
to be what the Bush campaign is all about.'' George Bush accused
his rival of ``a rather unrealistic view of America's role'' in
foreign affairs.
   The Democratic presidential nominee traveled by bus through
small farm communities of Illinois and Missouri, aiming for the
rural vote and charging Bush with favoring ``corporate operators''
over family farmers.
   Bush, flush with a new batch of good-news polls, called for
bipartisan congressional agreement on foreign policy concerns. He
promised to convene an early summit of NATO allies if elected
president.
   Dukakis flashed anger when he was shown a Republican brochure
attacking him as soft on crime.
   The brochure said that a convicted Illinois mass-murderer, John
Wayne Gacy, would be ``eligible for weekend passes'' in
Massachusetts, under Dukakis' prison furlough program. It asserted
that ``murders and rapists and drug pushers and child molesters in
Massachusetts vote for Michael Dukakis.''
   ``Friends, this is garbage,'' Dukakis said, holding aloft the
item mailed by Republicans. ``This is political garbage.''
   With Democrats urging him to step up his responses to Bush's
charges, Dukakis said: ``My positions are being distorted on a
number of these issues. That seems to be what the Bush campaign is
all about.''
   On the one-year anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash, a
rumor about the presidential race was blamed in part for a sudden
afternoon drop in the stock market. The rumor making the rounds of
Wall Street was that the Washington Post would publish on Thursday
potentially damaging to Bush.
   ``There is no such story,'' said Robert Kaiser, assistant
managing editor for national news at the Post.
   Bush spoke at the University of Michigan, where he sought to
portray Dukakis as inexperienced in foreign affairs.
   ``He has a rather unrealistic view of America's role and the way
in which we lead,'' Bush said. ``The liberal Massachusetts governor
seems to think that all we need to do is offer Moscow economic
inducements and a less aggressive, less threatening Soviet Union
will be the result. He's wrong.''
   Bush got a helping hand from President Reagan in the industrial
battleground of Ohio. Reagan used the word ``liberal'' more than 50
times in three speeches denouncing Dukakis and Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   Reagan said the presidential race is a battle ``between the
liberals and the rest of us.''
   ``Where they want to take America, America doesn't want to go,''
the president said. ``... Their policies are liberal, liberal,
liberal.''
   Bush had been trying to conceal his elation over two new polls
which showed him widening his lead over Dukakis. A poll released
late Wednesday by ABC News, however, showed the lead returning to
what Bush had before last week's presidential debate.
   The ABC News-Washington Post poll, done Oct. 12 through Tuesday,
put the race at 52-45, little different from its 51-45 result Oct.
5-11. The survey of 1,195 likely voters had a margin of error of
about three percentage points.
   A Harris Poll published Wednesday gave Bush a nine-point
national lead, 53 percent to 44 percent, among 1,356 likely voters
surveyed last weekend.
   The poll gave Bush a smaller lead than the 17 points reported by
an NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey published earlier in the
week, but it was considerably larger than the two-point edge given
Bush by a Harris Poll taken a week earlier. The Harris survey had a
margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   A new Field Poll in California, where the race has been
considered tight, showed Bush pulling ahead of Dukakis in a
must-win state for the Democrats.
   The survey by pollster Mervin Field had Bush leading 50 percent
to 41 percent. The poll was taken over the weekend, after the final
presidential debate, and sampled the preferences of 444 registered
California voters. The margin of error was 4.7 percent.
   At Dukakis' headquarters in Boston, campaign officials were
trying to buy a half-hour of television time on each of the major
networks the night before the Nov. 8 election.
   Dukakis stopped at the pig farm of Jim and Mabel Reed in tiny
Hull, Ill., where he met with local farmers. The session was beamed
by satellite to television viewers in 20 farm states.
   He said Bush's philosophy was ``the fewer farms the better,''
and that the Republicans ``like corporate operators'' over family
farmers.
   One farmer asked if Dukakis would ``get mean'' in the final days
of the campaign.
   ``Am I going to get mean?'' replied Dukakis. ``I'm going to get
tough. You don't want a mean president. You want a tough
president.''
   A local congressman, Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said Dukakis
has been hurt badly by Bush television commercials depicting the
Democratic nominee as soft on crime.
   Dukakis, asked if his message was being obliterated by those
negative commercials, replied that ``The truth will win out.''
   ``We're going to get the truth out to the American people,''
Dukakis said. ``My positions are being distorted. ... I think in
the last analysis the American people will respond to the truth.''
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said the vice president's push
had shifted into a ``final phase'' calling for one major address a
day and visits to the pivotal big-vote states of California, Ohio,
Illinois, Michigan and New Jersey.
   He said Bush also would make a major effort in New York, a state
where Dukakis has held a small edge.
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, campaigning
in California, blasted Bush for his environmental record and his
campaign style.
   Bentsen said the Republicans were ``reducing the caliber of a
national campaign to the level of a mud-wrestling festival.''
   ``They have viciously slandered the patriotism and record of
Michael Dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness and
light when they are called to account,'' Bentsen said.
   Republican Dan Quayle met privately with Jewish backers in
Chicago and later said Republicans ``haven't done as good a job as
we should have'' in communicating views on Israel and the Jewish
community.

   Michael Dukakis accused Republicans on
Wednesday of resorting to ``garbage'' and distortions in the race
for the White House, citing a Republican brochure that says a
convicted Illinois mass-murderer would be ``eligible for weekend
passes'' in Massachusetts.
   ``Friends, this is garbage,'' Dukakis said, holding aloft a GOP
mailing to Illinois voters that deals with a controversial
Massachusetts furlough program. ``This is political garbage.''
   Dukakis, facing widespread advice from Democrats to respond more
aggressively to Bush, decided to do so on a crisp autumn day of
campaigning in rural Illinois and Missouri in which he also accused
Republicans of lack of concern for rural issues.
   But his main text for the day was fighting back.
   ``This isn't worthy of a presidential campaign,''he said of the
brochure, which said Illinois mass murderer John Wayne Gacy would
``be eligible for weekend passes'' in the Massachusetts program.
   ``They shouldn't lower the level of a political debate,'' he
said of the Republicans, who have used the program to suggest that
Dukakis is soft on crime. ``They should inform the voters and not
mislead and frighten them.''
   Gacy was convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for murdering
33 young men and boys, 29 of whose bodies were found in his home in
the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines.
   Dukakis also held up a second brochure sponsored by the Illinois
Republican Party that said, ``All the Murderers and Rapists and
Drug Pushers and Child Molesters in Massachusetts Vote for Michael
Dukakis.''
   Dukakis toughened his rhetoric during the day, telling a crowd
at a farm in Palmyra, Mo., ``I've never seen such a pack of lies in
my life.''
   Aides traveling wuith Dukakis specifically denied that Gacy
would be eligible for weekend passes under the Massachusetts
furlough program. They also disputed the allegation in one of the
pamphlets that Dukakis said he would commute every death penalty
given to murderers in the event that the people of Massachusetts
voted to reinstate in the death sentence.
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis told reporters: ``My positions are
being distorted on a number of these issues. That seems to be what
the Bush campaign is all about.''
   He declined to say precisely what he had in mind for the three
weeks remaining to Election Day.
   ``We're going to get the truth out to the American people,''
Dukakis told reporters after a call-in program beamed by satellite
from a pig farm, the first stop of his rural America bus tour.
   The Massachusetts governor wore a suede jacket over a checked
shirt and khaki pants for his day in the country. At his first
stop, Jim and Mabel Reed's 900-acre spread along Illinois Highway
57, the backdrop included farm tractors, pig pens and silos.
Dukakis sat on a bale of hay while he delivered his populist
rhetoric in terms specially scripted for farmers.
   ``I don't remember any time in this campaign he's expressed any
concern about family farmers,'' Dukakis said of Bush. He said
Republicans ``like corporate operators.''
   From there, the bus ride through rolling, rich farmland led to
Quincy, and an outdoor, flag-draped rally downtown.
   ``George Bush cares about the people who hold mortgages on
family farms. I care about people who pay them,'' he said.
   Near the end of his speech, he held up the GOP mailing and said
they ``shouldn't lower the level of a political debate.''
   The mailing says Dukakis ``supported a program in his home state
that let murderers, rapists and child molesters free on weekend
passes.'' It recounts the story of an escaped furloughed prisoner
who brutalized a Maryland couple and says if Illinois mass murderer
John Gacy had committed his crimes in Boston, he would be
``eligible for weekend passes'' under Dukakis program.
   Dukakis said he had accepted responsibility for the
Massachusetts incident, and noted that President Reagan had
accepted responsibility for similar incidents in a federal program.
   That program, he noted, ``is furloughing murderers and its
furloughing pushers and drug peddlers, the people he (Bush) now
tells us he wants to execute.''
   Dukakis declined to tell reporters whether he would purchase
time in 30-minute blocks on network television to carry his case
directly to the voters, and aides declined to discuss any
television commercials that might be in production.
   Dukakis acknowleges he is behind in the race for the White
House, although his aides say the race is far closer than the
17-point margin found in an NBC-Wall Street Journal survey
completed over the weekend. In the manner of all lagging
candidates, Dukakis insists at every stop that the victory can
still be won.
   Even so, with only three weeks left in the campaign and the
presidential debates behind him, Dukakis and aides have been
struggling to find a way to turn the tide in their favor.

<TEXT>
   Four Politburo members resigned
Wednesday rather than face a confidence vote in the Communist
Party's Central Committee, which ended its three-day meeting
without a crisis solution in sight.
   Another member, Dusan Ckrebic from the Serbian republic, offered
to quit after losing a confidence vote, the first time that has
happened since the Communists took power in 1945.
   The nation is torn by ethnic, political and economic problems,
but Stipe Suvar, the Communist Party chief, declared, ``Yugoslavia
will not fall apart.'' He told a news conference there was
``virtual consensus (among the leaders) for profound changes'' and
insisted the meeting had made ``a step forward'' in solving its
woes.
   The Central Committee accepted a proposal from Suvar to replace
one-third of its 165 members over the next six weeks. If this goes
ahead, it would be the single biggest sweep through the ruling
elite since 1948, when Stalinists were purged after Josip Broz Tito
broke with Moscow.
   But Yugoslav leaders remained deeply divided, and popular
criticism of the hierarchy seemed unlikely to abate.
   Ckrebic's defeat in the confidence vote was seen as a blow to
Serbian Communist Party leader Slobodan Milosevic, whose insistence
on more Serbian control over the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina
and Kosovo has deepened Yugoslavia's political and ethnic rifts.
   Crkebic, an oldtime Communist in his 60s, was seen as a
Milosevic ally.
   Ten of the 23 members of the Presidium, or Politburo, were up
for the vote and had been expected to resign. Nine obtained more
than the simple majority of 83 required from the full Central
Committee membership of 165, but Ckrebic mustered only 68 votes.
   The resignations of another four members _ Kolj Siroka, Bosko
Krunic, Milanko Renovica and Franc Setinc _ were unanimously
accepted by the Central Committee. Nine, including Milosevic, were
exempt because they hold seats as party chiefs of Yugoslavia's six
republics, two provinces and the armed forces.
   ``Please accept immediately my resignation,'' Ckrebic said after
losing the confidence vote in a secret ballot.
   Milosevic demanded that Ckrebic's offer not be considered
immediately and Suvar later told reporters the resignation will be
discussed at a regular meeting of the Presidium in 10 days.
   The confidence vote followed heavy public criticism that the
Communist chiefs failed to provide strong leadership, calm ethnic
tension and ease Yugoslavia's worst economic crisis since World War
II. Inflation is more than 200 percent, unemployment is 15 percent
and the foreign debt is $21 billion.
   The economic problems have led to increasing strikes and worker
unrest, adding to the ethnic tensions in a country of more than 20
ethnic groups.
   Wednesday's events may well increase ethnic divisions because
the Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group, were likely to be
unhappy with the outcome.
   Serbs have been rallying by the hundreds of thousands to push
for more control over Kosovo, an ancient Serbian heartland
bordering Albania and now dominated by ethnic Albanians.
   Some of Kosovo's 200,000 Serbs called a rally Thursday in
Pristina, their capital.
   The four resigned Politburo members gave different reasons for
their actions. But all had come under fire in the state-run media
and at public rallies.
   The state-run Tanjug news agency said Suvar received 126 votes.
   Suvar, in proposing the Central Committee changes, said an
extensive list of candidates would be prepared in the next month
and then voting would start.
   In another implicit defeat for Milosevic, the Central Committee
agreed Wednesday only to set up a working committee to review
Serbian calls for the ouster from the Central Committee of three
Kosovo leaders _ two ethnic Albanians and one Serb.
   In a move that seemed designed to quell potential further
unrest, authorities indefinitely postponed a mass rally in Belgrade
called for Saturday.
   Up to 1 million Serbs had been expected to attend the rally to
express their solidarity with their Slav brothers in Kosovo.

<HEAD>House, Senate Negotiators Seek Compromise Drug Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators met Wednesday
night to fashion compromise anti-drug legislation, the major bill
that is keeping the 100th Congress in session.
   Members of the House and Senate judiciary committees, and other
lawmakers interested in law enforcement issues, met to resolve
differences in the anti-crime provisions of the bill.
   A separate group of lawmakers representing the House and Senate
leadership tried to resolve other issues, including provisions on
drug prevention, education, treatment, testing, loss of federal
benefits, obscenity and pornography.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said the working
groups have ``made progress,'' adding he hoped that compromise
language would be available by Thursday afternoon. If that
timetable is met, a vote would be expected Friday, when the
agreement could be written in the form of a bill.
   Many senators already have fled Washington to campaign, since
there were no roll calls Wednesday and none scheduled for Thursday.
   Both Byrd and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said it
will be difficult to get senators to return, and told reporters the
drug bill could be approved by voice vote.
   ``There's a determination by the joint leadership to get the
drug bill and get it done by Friday,'' Dole said.
   House members, off since last week, returned to Washington on
Wednesday for a full day of work, and they were expected to remain
in town for the drug legislation.
   The two houses have passed bills with different language on a
number of key issues.
   They include: the death penalty for those who kill during drug
crimes; civil penalties of up to $10,000 for possession of
marijuana, cocaine and other drugs; increased penalties for train
and bus operators found to operate their vehicles under the
influence of alcohol or drugs.
   Also, distribution of anabolic steroids without a prescription;
denial of some federal benefits for those convicted of drug crimes;
drug testing of transportation workers; standards for drug testing
laboratories; money laundering; plastic guns; law enforcement
funding; education and prevention programs; foreign aid to
drug-fighting countries; and creation of a Cabinet-level ``drug
czar'' to coordinate drug policy.
   The Senate bill includes anti-obscenity and anti-pornography
language not in the House measure.
   Only the House bill includes a grant program for states willing
to establish enforcement programs that require suspension or
revocation of drivers' licenses for drug convictions.

<HEAD>Egg-Size Diamond Is Too Rich for Auction Bidders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flawless diamond the size of an egg proved too
much of a good thing Wednesday, when its owners rejected a record
$12 million bid as too low and pulled it off the auction block.
   It was the second time in two days that a precious stone
expected to bring a record price was removed from auction without a
sale.
   The polished diamond, which weighs 407.8 carats _ the world's
second largest _ was offered by Christie's on behalf of two New
York jewelry dealers and the Zale Corp., a Dallas-based chain of
jewelry stores.
   Although the $12 million bid was the highest ever made at a gem
auction, officials said, it was deemed too low and rejected.
   ``This was an experiment,'' said Francois Curiel, head of
Christie's jewelry department.
   The bidding took place as a Christie's employee dressed in black
appeared from behind a revolving wall holding up the diamond amid
gasps from the audience.
   On Tuesday, the rival auction house Sotheby's was forced to
remove from auction the royal red Mandalay Ruby, which was supposed
to sell for $15 million. The high bid of $7.6 million was rejected
by the gem's owner.
   Christie's would not estimate how much its diamond would bring,
although Curiel noted that on April 19, an 85.91-carat white
diamond was auctioned for $9.31 million _ a record for any gem.
   ``I'm certain this jewel will set a record price for a single
precious stone,'' he said before the bidding.
   Several other lots at the Christie's sale also were withdrawn
because they failed to reach the minimum bid. Those that were sold
included a 59-carat, unmounted pear-shaped diamond for $5.55
million, a diamond necklace for $1.3 million and a 23.95-carat
diamond ring for $1.2 million.
   The prices do not include a 10 percent buyer's premium.
   Christie's said the sale total was $26.8 million, including the
10 percent buyer's premium. Out of 402 lots, 314 sold, it said.
   Other items sold included a necklace and bracelet of emerald
beads once collected by the Shah Jehan, builder of the Taj Majal,
which fetched $370,000; and a diamond-fringed necklace from the
collection of prima ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn for $55,000.
   Christie's diamond was described as the largest ever offered at
a public auction. It is second in size only to the 530.20-carat
Cullinan I, set in Britain's Imperial Sceptre as part of the Crown
Jewels.
   The diamond was purchased as an uncut 890-carat stone in August
1984 and took three years to cut and finish.
   Christie's said the gem was unusual both for its rich golden
color and shield shape and was the largest colored or fancy diamond
known. The gem measures more than 2 inches high, 1.38 inches wide
and 1.10 inches deep. It weighs about 3 ounces.
   Sotheby's auctioned another diamond Tuesday _ the Star of Sierra
Leone Diamond No. 2 _ for $3.52 million. It is one of 11 stones cut
from a 969-carat diamond discovered in the west African nation in
1972.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association is offering a
coloring book featuring Dick and Jane-like characters and their
friend Eddie the Eagle to teach children about gun safety, but
educators are wary about using it.
   The aim of the six-page book, said NRA board member Jim
Zangrilli of suburban Oak Park, is to stop youngsters' accidental
shootings with the message that they shouldn't touch any weapons
they find but instead summon an adult.
   ``It's a very cute coloring book,'' he said. ``The cover shows a
little boy and girl shaking hands with Eddie the Eagle, and it says
`My gun safety book.'''
   The NRA wants Chicago-area schools to use the book, but the idea
has received a lukewarm reception from school officials.
   ``If I wanted a program on that topic in schools, I surely
wouldn't go to the National Rifle Association for help,'' said
Brother Donald Houde, director of administrative affairs for the
Chicago Archdiocese's Office of Catholic Education. He had not seen
the book.
   Zangrilli plans to send the book to officials at the city's
public and parochial schools this week. ``We hope they'll allow
schools in the Chicago area to utilize this thing,'' he said.
   Chicago Board of Education spokesman Bob Saigh said that without
seeing the book, he could not comment. He said any proposal from
the NRA would receive ``appropriate consideration.''
   Zangrilli said the book does not promote the NRA or seek to win
the youngsters over to its positions on gun control. He said the
group's name was written only in small letters on the back page.
   ``We're always happy when people join the NRA,'' he said. ``But
that's not the purpose of it. The purpose is to stop accidental
shootings.''
   He said the message emphasized is that if children find a gun,
they should ``stop, don't touch, leave the area, tell an adult.''
   ``The reality of the real world is there's firearms all over the
real world,'' Zangrilli said. ``We think it's a very good idea to
tell children in the schools not to touch them.''
   Cmdr. Sollie Vincent, head of the police department's gang
crimes unit, said that while the message might be important, the
schools probably are not the proper place to teach it.
   ``It seems to me that stressing gun safety in the classroom is a
fairly negative approach,'' Vincent said. ``It assumes that guns
are going to be available to children. And if that is the case,
that is adequate reason for removing guns out of society.''
   Nationally, of the 3,097 youths killed with guns in 1985, 519
died accidentally, according to the most recent figures available
from the National Center for Health Statistics.

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Palestinians were
reported killed and 10 wounded Wednesday as a general strike to
protest Jewish settlements shut the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Despite the strike, a bus caravan of Israelis toured Gaza to
demand Israel keep the seaside strip.
   Shops and public transit were shut down and roads were blocked
with stones and burning tires in response to a strike call by
underground leaders who are backed by the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Outlawed Palestinian flags flew from utility poles
and mosques.
   Israeli cars were stoned outside West Bank refugee camps near
the Biblical city of Bethlehem and in Ramallah, north of Jerusalem.
No injuries were reported.
   Near the West Bank village of Beit Ummar, an Israeli police car
crashed into an Arab vehicle, killing two Palestinians and injuring
one, Israel radio said.
   It said the incident was caused by oil spread by Palestinian
activists to force vehicles off the road during the strike. The
army command had no comment.
   In the West Bank village of Jenin, a 24-year-old man was shot in
the stomach and a 50-year-old man wounded in the neck when troops
opened fire on stone-throwers, officials at Al-Ittihad hospital
said. They said both victims were in critical condition.
   Two teen-agers and a 10-year-old boy also were shot in the West
Bank when protesters threw rocks at soldiers in the village of
Bartaa, near Jenin, and in Palestinian refugee camps at Tulkarem
and Askar, said the hospital officials, who insisted on anonymity.
   In Gaza City, troops fired during a stone-throwing protest,
seriously wounding a 16-year-old, officials at the city's Ahli Arab
Hospital said.
   In Gaza Strip's town of Rafah, four Palestinians, including a
70-year-old woman, sustained wounds on their limbs from plastic
bullets, hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed five people wounded in the West Bank, but a
spokesman said reports of injuries in Gaza still were being checked.
   The caravan of 50 Israeli buses took a back road to skirt the
main street through Gaza City as it headed for Jewish settlements
where about 2,000 Jews live amid the strip's 650,000 Arabs.
   Dozens of soldiers stood guard in jeeps and on rooftops when the
buses, sponsored by the right-wing Likud bloc that opposes
returning any Arab land, stopped on the southern edge of Gaza City.
   The area was one of 11 neighborhoods, villages or Palestinian
refugee camps, altogether housing about 215,000 people, that was
put under curfew by the army for the strike and visit by the Likud
backers.
   Such curfews require residents to stay indoors, but Palestinians
peered from alleys at the Israelis, many wearing the blue and white
caps and T-shirts of the Likud. Some buses bore pictures of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Likud's leader.
   An elderly woman got off one bus, did a mock Arab dance and
shouted, ``Let's drive them crazy!''
   Another Likud supporter said rocks were thrown at his bus, but
soldiers said they could not confirm that report.
   At a rally of about 3,000 people at the settlement of Gush
Katif, Likud candidate and Cabinet minister Moshe Katzoff denounced
the rival Labor Party's plan to give up parts of the West Bank and
Gaza in exchange for peace.
   ``They tell us if we give up Gaza, we prevent wars,'' he said.
``We tell them to prevent wars we have to stay in Gaza and Gush
Katif.''
   On Friday, the Israeli daily Hadashot reported that Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the Labor Party challenging Likud
in Nov. 1 parliamentary elections, was opening contacts with
Jordan's King Hussein in hopes of a peace settlement.
   Peres has said if elected prime minister, he would hold
elections in the territories to chose Palestinian delegates to join
Jordanians in peace talks. Shamir called that an election gimmick.
   Also Wednesday, two Israeli parliament members from the
left-wing Progressive List for Peace announced they met with a PLO
delegation in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in violation of Israeli law.
   The legislators, Matityahu Peled and Muhammed Miari, called for
a Palestinian state beside Israel and said a similar statement,
also recognizing Israel's sovereignty, was being made by the PLO in
Belgrade. Their joint Arab-Jewish party supports contact with the
PLO and a Palestinian state.
   Wednesday's strike was the lastest of dozens in the 10-month-old
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza,
which were captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   In a leaflet issued last week, the underground leadership urged
the strike against Jewish settlers, saying in 65,000 settlers
living in occupied land ignited violence among the 1.5 million Arab
residents.
   At least 303 Palestinians and six Israelis have died in the
``intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for uprising by which the revolt has
become known.

   Rain drenched areas in the central Plains and from northeast
Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania to the East Coast on Wednesday.
   Showers were scattered from eastern parts of Wyoming and
northern Colorado across Nebraska and southeastern South Dakota
into northeast Kansas. Thunderstorms were scattered over the
Southwest deserts, and patches of extreme southern California and
southwest Arizona had sprinkles of rain.
   A few showers continued over parts of Louisiana and Mississippi,
on the central Gulf Coast. In the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT,
nearly three-quarters of an inch of rain fell at Monroe, La.
   Temperatures were in the 50s or 60s across much of the nation
Wednesday afternoon. Temperatures were in the 40s in parts of the
northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley through the Great
Lakes into New England. Readings were in the upper 30s in parts of
upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin into the Minnesota arrowhead.
   Temperatures were in the 70s and 80s from the southern Atlantic
Coast and Florida through the Gulf Coast into the southern half of
Texas. Temperatures also were in the 70s and 80s from the southern
Rockies into the valleys of California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Rhinelander, Wis., to 92 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The nation's low Wednesday morning was 20 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Thursday's forecast called for rain showers widespread from the
middle Mississippi and lower Missouri valleys into the northern
part of the southern Plains. Showers were expected to be scattered
across the upper Mississippi Valley, the lower Mississippi Valley
through the Gulf Coast and northern Florida. Scattered snow showers
were forecast for the northern two-thirds of Maine. Sunny, warm
weather was predicted for much of the region west of the Rockies.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 60s or 70s across
much of the nation, the 50s from the eastern Dakotas through the
middle Mississippi and lower Ohio valleys into the mid Atlantic
coast, 40s from the northern Great Lakes through southern New
England, and 30s in northern Maine. Highs should be in the 80s
across southern Florida, from southern Texas through the southern
Rockies into the California valleys, and 90s in the middle Rio
Grande Valley, the desert Southwest and the northern California
valleys.

   The Dutch are reliving the painful
years of wartime collaboration after revelations that countrymen
who once volunteered as Nazi SS members during World War II have
been holding secret annual reunions.
   The gatherings came to light recently in an interview in the
weekly Vrij Nederland with Jan Rudolf Hommes, a 70-year-old former
lieutenant in the Dutch SS who talked about the reunions.
   The SS, or Schutzstaffeln (Protection Units), were founded in
1929 and originally served as bodyguards to Adolf Hitler and other
senior Nazi officials. Led by Heinrich Himmler, the SS later served
as guards in Nazi death camps throughout wartime Europe.
   The unit also gained notoriety for fanaticism in combat. A Dutch
SS unit fought on the Russian front, the largest non-German SS unit
to do so.
   The next reunion for former SS members, wives and widows is
scheduled for May or June in southwestern Netherlands' Biesbosch
region, Hommes told The Associated Press on Wednesday. He refused
to say exactly when or where.
   News of the scheduled meeting was played up in this weeks's
Dutch press, reflecting the disdain here for the 20,000 Dutch
citizens who signed up for SS duty during Nazi Germany's brutal,
five-year occupation of the Netherlands. The nation's Jewish
community was all but destroyed in the death camps.
   Two German Nazis are still imprisoned here for war crimes.
Periodic calls for their release provoke an outcry from the Dutch
public.
   Disclosures of the reunions have drawn vows from Biesbosch
officials and wartime resistance leaders to do whatever they can to
stop the gathering.
   Hommes described the reunions as ``having a nice day out'' and
made light of all the publicity.
   ``They're making such a tremendous amount of fuss,'' Hommes
complained. ``It's just like a bunch of kids from kindergarten .. .
They've found something to get all excited about.''
   He said about 20 people took part in the 1988 reunion last
spring in northern Drente province.
   ``There are fewer of us every year ... They're dying all the
time,'' said Hommes, who said he served as a war correspondent
during the German invasion of the Soviet Union and in Normandy
after Allied troops landed there in 1944.
   ``We've been doing this undisturbed, in all quiet for 40 years.''
   He said he now regretted joining the SS ``because all kinds of
things happened that I never suspected were happening.''
   ``We all learned our lesson,'' he said. ``We simply made a
mistake.''
   After the war, a Dutch court sentenced Hommes to three years in
prison for collaboration. He worked as a Dutch civil servant
following his release.
   Hendrik van Liempd, a spokesman for former Dutch resistance
fighters in the Biesbosch region, said local resistance figures
would lobby hotel and boat owners not to offer their services to
the SS group.
   D. ten Veen, a city hall official in the Biesbosch city of
Dordrecht, said, ``We don't want such a reunion in the Biesbosch.
We'll try to prevent this gathering by whatever legal means we
have,''according to the Brabants Nieuwsblad newspaper.
   It quoted him as saying that authorities can do nothing to
prevent the meeting, however, unless it presents a threat to public
order.
   Austrian Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal accused the Dutch
government Wednesday of being too lax in seeking to extradite three
Dutch war criminals who fled the nation and were convicted in
abstentia.
   ``I have the impression the thing isn't being prosecuted with
enough energy,'' he told reporters at Amsterdam's City Hall.

Michael Dukakis 46 percent to 36 percent in a University of
Connecticut poll released Wednesday.
   The statewide poll, conducted for The Hartford Courant, compares
with a 2-point margin he enjoyed in the last poll taken Sept. 12 to
Sept. 18.
   The latest survey was taken by telephone between Oct. 11 and
Sunday, straddling the final Bush-Dukakis debate Oct. 13, and has a
margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
   Conducted by the Institute for Social Inquiry at the University

<HEAD>Vatican Denies Crackdown on Brazilian Bishops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican denied on Wednesday that it was
cracking down on Brazilian bishops for being too progressive.
   Italian news agencies quoted the Brazilian newspaper Folha de
Sao Paolo as reporting that in the past month the Vatican's
Congregation for Bishops had sent letters of warning to several
Brazilian bishops considered too liberal.
   The paper reportedly said the Vatican had gone on the offensive
against the bishops for straying from Roman Catholic teaching,
especially regarding control of seminaries and Catholic
universities.
   Asked about the report, the Vatican deputy spokesman, the Rev.
Giovanni d'Ercole, told reporters, ``There is no basis for such an
assertion: it is completely false.''
   A month ago, the Vatican cautioned liberal Bishop Petro
Casaldaliga of Sao Felix do Araguaia to remain faithful to the
teachings of the church.
   The Brazilian bishop is an exponent of liberation theology,
which sometimes uses Marxist analysis, and has publicly supported
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and leftist opposition
forces in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
   ``The bishop was reminded of some of his duties'' during a
recent trip to Rome, d`Ercole said on Sept. 24. ``In particular,
this bishop has been asked to always be fully faithful to the
teachings of the church and not to interfere in the affairs of
other (Roman Catholic) churches by going to dioceses in other
countries without the consent of local bishops.''
   The newspaper reportedly said a new crackdown began after the
warning to Casaldaliga. Cardinal Aloisio Lorscheider, archbishop of
Fortaleza, Brazil, was among those reportedly receiving the letters.

<TEXT>
   A Boeing 737 jetliner and another Indian
passenger plane crashed in bad weather within two hours of each
other Wednesday, and authorities said the death toll may be as high
as 164.
   The Indian Airlines jet was trying to land in heavy fog at the
western city of Ahmadabad when it slammed into a tree, hit a power
line and crashed. All but five of the 135 people aboard were
killed, and three of the survivors were in serious condition with
burns and broken bones.
   About 1\ hours later, a 30-year-old Fokker Friendship propeller
plane leased by Indian Airlines to the domestic carrier Vayudoot
hit the side of a hill in eastern India during a severe rainstorm,
and all 34 people aboard were feared dead, officials said.
   Indian Airlines Flight 131 was flying from Bombay with 129
passengers and six crewmembers when it crashed at 7:40 a.m.
Wednesday (10:10 p.m. EDT Tuesday) on its final approach to
Ahmadabad airport, about 500 miles southwest of New Delhi.
   Federal Aviation Minister Shiv Raj Patil said the death toll of
130 was the worst in the carrier's 26-year history. It was the
airline's 16th major accident.
   The government-run airline, which flies to 73 airports in India
and to nine other countries, has come under fire recently for
allegedly failing to maintain pre-flight safety procedures.
   The cause of Wednesday's crash was not immediately known, but
one airline official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
airline suspects a technical malfunction complicated by bad weather.
   Patil said he did not rule out sabotage and ordered an
investigation headed by a high court judge.
   A recording between the pilot and the Ahmadabad control tower
gave no indication of trouble. Rescue workers found the flight data
and cockpit voice recorders in smoldering wreckage and
blood-stained debris.
   Survivor Paag Vasavda, 28, said the pilot told passengers he was
having trouble landing in the fog. Vasavda said he heard two
explosions.
   ``Afterward, the plane broke apart,'' said Vasavda, who was
thrown from the plane while still strapped in his seat.
   Pratap G. Thakore, a farmer whose fields are near the airport,
said: ``I saw flames coming from the plane while it was in the air.
As it was coming down, it hit a tree and then an electricity line
and then crashed.''
   Press Trust of India news agency quoted survivor Vindo Tripathy
as saying he ran from the plane after it hit the ground.
   ``I can, even at the age of 57, run like a hare,'' Tripathy
said. ``Death and misery were everywhere.''
   Tripathy, who later lost consciousness, suffered severe burns
and broke both legs and hands.
   The passenger manifest said the victims included two Japanese,
three Germans and an industrialist from Bahrain. The United News of
India news agency said at least 11 foreigners were aboard but did
not identify the other five.
   The Fokker Friendship crashed into a 1,400-foot hill near
Guwahati airport, about 960 miles east of New Delhi. It was nearing
the end of a flight from Silchar, about 112 miles to the southeast.
   The plane, made in 1958, reported zero visibility, then lost
contact with the Guwahati control tower two minutes before the 8:55
a.m. (11:25 p.m. EDT Tuesday), said C. Das, the top civil
administrator for Guwahati district.
   All 31 passengers and three crew members were feared dead, he
said. The crash site, in a dense forest, could not be reached
because of rain.
   The government owns Indian Airlines, Vayadoot and Air-India,
which operates only on international routes.
   On June 19, the pilot of an Indian Airlines plane forgot to
lower the landing gear and slid to a stop in New Delhi. None of the
passengers was hurt.
   The latest edition of India Today newsmagazine said the airline
neglects maintenance and fails to properly supervise pilots. It
quoted an unidentified civil aviation official as saying pilots
rarely attend weather briefings.
   An Indian Airlines Boeing 737 made a crash-landing in Calcutta
in February 1985 after the pilot and co-pilot failed to lower the
landing gear.
   The magazine said an investigation revealed the two men were
``not on speaking terms'' and did not read out the standard
checklist of landing procedures.
   The airline refused comment.
   The Boeing 737 that crashed Wednesday was acquired in 1971 and
is one of the oldest in Indian Airlines' 50-plane fleet.
   In April, an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 broke apart and made a
miraculous landing with a 20-foot section missing from its
fuselage. A flight attendant was killed.
   This week, National Transportation and Safety Board officials
said cracks were found on a Continental Airlines 737 fuselage on
Oct. 5.

   Leftist rebels marked their
army's eighth anniversary Wednesday with coordinated attacks on
army-defended coffee plantations and a prison in eastern Usulutan
province.
   Two soldiers were killed and eight wounded in the attacks, said
military authorities in the capital and those contacted by
telephone in Santiago de Maria, the scene of fighting 70 miles east
of San Salvador.
   The fighting began hours after two car bomb explosions wounded
six civilians in an affluent district of San Salvador. The rebels
were presumed to be behind the bombings.
   Military officers said the attacks on Santiago de Maria's
outskirts began minutes before Tuesday midnight and lasted until
approximately 3 a.m. Wednesday. The town has about 20,000 people.
   The main targets were three plantations surrounding the town;
their processing plants; the local prison, and an electricity
transmission plant.
   Prudencio Llach, owner of one of the plantations attacked, is
the father-in-law of Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Vides and also
father-in-law of rightist presidential candidate Alfredo Cristiani.
   About 50 common criminals were reported freed in the prison
attack. Military officials said the electric plant was slightly
damaged. The guerrillas said it was destroyed.
   The rebels formed a unified command, the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, in October 1980. They celebrate its
anniversary thoughout October.
   Sabotage is a key element in the guerrilla war against the
U.S.-backed forces. Coffee, cotton and sugar plantations are common
targets because they bring in most of El Salvador's foreign
exchange.
   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos (We Will Win) said the
attacks were part of an operation called ``With the people we
advance toward victory on the eighth anniversary of the FMLN.''
   Neither military officials nor Radio Venceremos mentioned rebel
casualties.
   Military officers estimate there are between 6,000 and 7,000
full-time guerrillas and perhaps twice as many men and women who
serve part-time in the militia. There are 55,000 men in the armed
forces.
   Rebel radio also said air force planes and helicopters attacked
Torola, in eastern Morazan province, with bombs, rockets and
machine guns on Monday. It said a rocket hit the town's church
while ``numerous'' people were inside, and three townspeople were
``gravely wounded.''
   Calls to the air force brought only the response that no officer
was available to comment on the allegation.

   Television actress Robin Givens said Wednesday
she would take no money in her celebrity divorce from her
heavyweight champion husband, multimillionaire Mike Tyson.
   ``I never wanted anything but what was best for Michael, to
protect Michael and preserve my marriage,'' Miss Givens said in a
statement read by her lawyer, Raoul Felder. ``I never wanted
anything for myself.''
   Thus, Miss Givens said in the two-page statement, she was
``unequivocally and irrevocably'' relinquishing her claim to money
from her 22-year-old husband, whose boxing fortune has been
estimated at $40 million.
   Miss Givens, 23, was described in divorce papers filed by Tyson
as having married him for his money. Tyson was traveling Wednesday
from Venezuela. His manager, Bill Cayton, had no comment, a
secretary said.
   Felder stressed repeatedly to skeptical reporters at a news
conference in his Manhattan office that Miss Givens sought nothing
from Tyson. ``It's set. Final. Yesterday's news. She's taking
nothing,'' he said.
   At another point, he said: ``Read my lips: She doesn't want
anything.''
   Miss Givens was in Los Angeles filming segments of her
television series, ABC's ``Head of the Class.'' The development in
New York was the latest turn in the tortuous public destruction of
her eight-month-old marriage.
   During an appearance Sept. 30 on ABC's ``20@20'' program, Miss
Givens said Tyson was manic-depressive and had an ``extremely
volatile temper.''
   Days later, she called police to their Bernardsville, N.J.,
mansion, where Tyson, she said, had flown into a rage. On Oct. 7
she filed for divorce in Los Angeles, calling her marriage ``a
continuous horror story'' in which Tyson hit her repeatedly, threw
things at her and threatened to kill her.
   Tyson responded with his own divorce suit Oct. 14 in Trenton,
N.J., claiming his wife married him for money and fame, then
abandoned him. He charged that she induced him to marry her by
pretending to be pregnant.
   Last week, Tyson said in a newspaper interview that his wife was
``evil'' and had played ``a sting game'' to get at his fortune.
Earlier he charged that she and her mother urged him to take
anti-depression drugs that made him appear listless in the ABC
interview.
   Some accounts portrayed the dispute as a battle between Miss
Givens and her mother and Tyson's managers for control of his
money. In her statement, Miss Givens said, ``I think I represented
a threat to many other people and that threat was engendered by my
love for Michael.''
   ``I have never said one bad word about Michael or done anything
to hurt him personally.'' Still, ``The stories became more and more
outrageous, untrue, scurrilous and defamatory,'' she said. ``We
were not permitted the dignity of dealing with our private
problems.''
   On Tyson's published comments, Miss Givens said, ``I don't
believe this is Michael talking.'' In any case, she said, ``I want
there to be dignity in our lives.'' She made two pledges:
   ``1. Michael can have his divorce.
   ``2. I will not seek nor accept any money for myself.
   ``I never married Michael for money. Therefore this represents
no loss for me other than the loss of losing my husband.''
   Felder, in response to questions, said she would not claim any
property, or money, for herself, or anyone else. ``She wants
nothing, from nothing, to use a New York phrase, from nothing,'' he
said.
   Felder said he believed the divorce could best be handled as a
``no-fault'' divorce under California law, but that he had not yet
spoken with Tyson's lawyers.
   In his years as a divorce lawyer, Felder said, ``I've never seen
a woman give up money. Particularly this kind of money. I've never
seen it before.''

<HEAD>Husband of Bombing Victim Charged With 34 Counts of Fraud,
Embezzlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   J. Gary Sheets, whose wife and former
business partner were killed by confessed bomber Mark Hofmann, was
charged Wednesday with 34 counts of fraud and embezzlement
involving $1.8 million.
   The charges announced by U.S. Attorney Brent Ward concern three
businesses in which Sheets allegedly misrepresented financial
resources, diverted pension funds and promised returns to investors
that he knew were impossible.
   Investors included members of the Osmond entertainment family.
   ``Basically, Mr. Sheets is charged with failing to tell people
what he was going to do with their money, doing something other
than what he said he would do and embezzling money from pension
plans,'' Ward said.
   ``We will have to prove that he had knowledge that what he was
doing was making false representations,'' he added.
   Ward said Sheets, who lives in San Diego, would appear for
arraignment in the next two weeks. A summons and copy of the
indictment was issued to Sheets' Salt Lake City attorney, Peter
Stirba, he said.
   Stirba said the charges were ``merely allegations'' and that his
client must be presumed innocent.
   ``The only comment I can give you is that we are going to do all
our talking in court, where it should be,'' Stirba said. He
declined to provide a telephone number for Sheets and there was
none listed.
   Sheets, 54, is charged with 10 counts of mail fraud, six counts
of securities fraud, 13 counts of interstate transportation of
money taken by fraud and five counts of embezzlement from pension
plans. The allegations cover the years 1984 and 1985.
   Each transportation count carries a maximum possible sentence of
10 years in prison. The other counts each carry a maximum penalty
of five years in prison.
   The allegations involve Sheets' Working Funds I and II, through
which limited partnerships were sold, and through Arrowhead Village
General Partnership.
   The indictment said Working Funds I and II were created in 1984
to generate capital that would be loaned to Sheets' financially
ailing J. Gary Sheets & Associates, a subsidiary of CFS Financial
Corp.
   Sheets did not disclose the financial condition of CFS and JGSA
to the 75 investors in the two securities, the indictment said, and
in some cases failed to show investors a prospectus. It also
alleged Sheets promised a 17 percent return, while knowing it was
not possible, and later failed to tell investors how their money
had been spent.
   Ward said some of the funds were diverted to Sheets' personal
use, and others were used to prop up other failing Sheets
enterprises, although he declined to be more specific.
   Six of the Working Fund counts involve alleged losses suffered
by members of the Osmond family. Sheets is charged with one count
of securities fraud and one count of pension fund embezzlement
against Marie Osmond.
   It alleged $30,000 was embezzled from Marie Inc., Profit Sharing
Plan, an employee benefit plan of which Mrs. Osmond was a trustee.
The indictment did not list an amount regarding the securities
fraud count.
   Sheets, CFS chairman, filed for personal bankruptcy in January
1986, 3{ months after his wife, Kathleen Sheets, and former CFS
vice president Steve Christensen were killed in the second of two
booby-trap bombings Oct. 15, 1985.
   Hofmann, 33, confessed to the bombings and is serving a life
sentence in Utah State Prison. He said he set the bombs to avoid
detection as a master forger and trafficker in bogus early Mormon
documents that had netted him hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   Sheets remarried in July 1987 and at the time was working as an
insurance agent and writing a book about overcoming grief and
tragedy.

   Police officers were ordered to wear bulletproof
vests on city streets Wednesday after two officers, who didn't have
on vests, were shot to death in separate incidents.
   The order, issued by Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward just
hours after the Tuesday night shootings, said the two officers
``might have survived if they were wearing their vests.''
   Officers are issued bullet-proof vests during their training at
the Police Academy, but were not previously required to wear them
on the job. The officers' union immediately agreed to the order.
   The order covers uniformed officers on patrol but not undercover
officers and would not have saved the life of one of the men
killed, undercover Officer Christopher Hoban, 26, of Brooklyn.
   He was shot at 7:10 p.m. Tuesday during an Upper West Side drug
raid when one of three cocaine dealers guessed that he and his
partner were policemen. One of the alleged dealers was also killed.
   Less than three hours later, at 9:45 p.m., Officer Michael J.
Buczek, 24, of Suffern, was killed when he and his partner
responded to a routine medical emergency call in Harlem and ended
up chasing two ``suspicious'' men.
   The officers asked them to stop, but they fled. The officers
chased them less than a block before each officer caught up with
one suspect. But one of the suspects spun around and killed Buczek
with two blasts from a semiautomatic weapon, Ward said.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch on Wednesday called for suspects in
drug-related murders, including those of police officers, to be
prosecuted under stricter federal laws by U.S. attorneys rather
than the city's district attorneys.
   The stricter federal penalties would include the death penalty
under proposed federal legislation now on President Reagan's desk.
   In his letter, Koch described Tuesday night as ``one of the
worst nights I have ever had as mayor.'' After each killing, Koch
and Ward met with the families of the officers and reported each
case at hospital news conferences.
   ``I share the mayor's and the police commissioner's concern that
these murderers receive the maximum penalty permitted by law. In
the event the pending federal drug law is passed, this office will
use it as often and as effectively as we can,'' U.S. Attorney
Andrew Maloney said in a statement.
   Hobans was shot in the chest and head as he and his partner,
Officer Michael Jermyn, 25, both assigned to Manhattan North
Narcotics, prepared to buy a gram of cocaine at an apartment.
Hobans was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where he
died around 10 p.m., police said.
   One of three suspected drug dealers in the room, Manuel
DeLarosa, 23, of Puerto Rico, was killed by the officers during the
struggle.
   Jermyn ran into the street and alerted back-up police forces,
who caught a second suspect. A third suspect, identified by police
as Bienvenido Castillo, 24, remained at large Wednesday.
   After the second shooting, Buczek was taken to
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, where he died from wounds to
the chest and abdomen, said O'Donnell.
   Elvin Roberto Pena Peralta, 27, one of the suspects, was
arrested at the scene and was to face a second-degree murder
charge, police said. A second suspect fled and was being sought.
   Police did not know which of the suspects fired the shots that
killed Buczek.
   A private group of business leaders immediately offered a
$10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of the suspects being sought.
   Ward said he knew of no previous cases where two officers were
slain in separate incidents in the same night.

   Eskimo whalers wielding chainsaws worked
Wednesday in a race against time to keep alive three whales trapped
by Arctic ice, while a rescue effort using an ice-breaking barge
got under way from Prudhoe Bay.
   Two Army National Guard Skycrane helicopters were rigged to
alternately tow a 185-ton Hovercraft-type ice-breaking barge to the
whales' location about 230 miles to the west.
   Bitter weather hampered the journey over desolate Arctic Ocean
ice, expected to take 25 to 40 hours.
   The first of the powerful transport helicopters lifted off at
noon (4 p.m. EDT), and the early going was ``real, real slow,''
said Sheryl Deveau, a spokeswoman for the rescue effort.
   The Skycrane was dragging the barge along ``an inch at a time,''
she said, with 10 miles of sand bars, mud and shallow water before
the barge would reach smooth ocean ice where the going would be
easier.
   By 4:30 p.m., the helicopter had towed the barge about four
miles from the dock and it appeared things were looking up.
   ``It's moving about 7 miles an hour now,'' said Mike Haller, a
National Guard spokesman. ``They've picked up some speed. They'll
continue on until darkness, and then they'll return here for some
maintenance before picking up the mission again at first light.''
   Workers labored through the night to unload 70 tons of aviation
fuel to lighten the VECO Inc. barge, which has no propulsion
system. The start of the rescue operation was delayed Monday while
the barge was repaired, then again Tuesday after the craft bogged
down in mud near shore.
   Bitter cold and constantly shifting ice trapped the animals in
shallow water two weeks ago as they were migrating south to warmer
waters. Since then, they have surfaced every few moments for air in
holes about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo village.
   North Slope whalers have cut at least two new breathing holes
for the whales, but by midday Wednesday the animals had shown no
interest in them. The whales appeared tired but holding their own,
biologists said.
   John Lien, professor of animal behavior at Memorial University
in Canada, said Wednesday that the whales should survive for
several more weeks despite being battered and bleeding from grating
against jagged ice.
   ``They can bleed a barrel and still be fine,'' said Lien, who
has helped free whales from ice for 20 years. ``We're talking about
a big animal here, between five to 20 tons.''
   While a National Weather Service ice analysis showed no open
water in the whales' vicinity, Jim Brooks, the acting director of
the National Marine Fisheries Service in Alaska, said a lead, or
pathway, through the ice had been spotted about five miles from the
whales.
   ``There are open water leads throughout the Chukchi Sea and
Beaufort Sea, out for a long ways. The ice is always moving. It's
very dynamic,'' he said.
   Brooks said there was no guarantee the whales could reach open
water even if they could get to the leads.
   ``But the hope is that they will be able to make it through the
leads via these open leads used by bowheads and belugas in their
migration. But the gray whale is not an ice-adapted animal. It just
doesn't seem to be able to contend with the ice as well as other
species of whale,'' he said.
   Bowhead whales and the smaller belugas migrate together through
the Arctic Ocean ice, he said. The belugas breathe through holes
smashed in the ice by the larger whales. It was hoped that the
grays might join bowheads migrating nearby and use the same air
holes, Brooks said.
   ``On the other hand, belugas and bowheads have evolved together
for thousands of years. That makes it highly speculative that the
grays would do the same thing,'' he said.
   The rescue operation stalled late Tuesday when the
helicopter-towed barge bogged down in mud just offshore.
   ``It was a goopy mess,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Tom
Williams, the helicopter's co-pilot. ``We were able to move the
barge without that much effort. The problem was that apparently we
went over some shallow mud in that area and the barge doesn't
operate well unless it's over water or ice. It bogged down. Up
until that point we were moving it.''
   The fuel taken off the barge by early Wednesday was to be used
for refueling the helicopters, said Haller. He said the helicopters
would have to fly back to Prudhoe Bay to refuel.
   If it does arrive, the barge is to use its fans and its bulk to
pulverize the ice beneath it and fashion a 40-foot swath to open
water.
   But if more hitches caused the mission to be scrubbed, the
helicopter crews were experimenting with an alternative which
involved using a 9,000-pound steel-reinforced concrete cylinder to
smash holes in the ice, Williams said.
   He said a leftover support from construction of the trans-Alaska
oil pipeline had been fitted so that it could be carried by the
helicopters. ``It's cylindrical, about four feet in diameter by
five feet tall, with points on one end to make it go through the
ice easier,'' he said.
   Rescuers had hoped the support could be dropped through the ice
and dragged to create a channel.
   ``We went out and experimented with it,'' Williams said. ``We
weren't able to drag it. If we used it we would have to punch hole
after hole after hole. The dragging part didn't work. Everytime you
punch a hole, the cracks get larger, they expand and seem to
enlarge.
   ``It would be very laborious if we had to make a solid string of
water six miles long,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mass Held in Palace For Army; Youths Sit In For Radical Priest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitian leader Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril joined hundreds of troops Wednesday at a special Mass for
army unity after a group of soldiers tried to overthrow the new
military government this week.
   Hours after the Mass, about 100 young people held a sit-in in
front of the Port-au-Prince Cathedral to protest a church order
telling a popular priest, Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, to leave the
country.
   It was the fifth such demonstration in a week. An attack on
Aristide's congregation by armed thugs who killed 12 people and
wounded 70 helped bring about the coup that swept Avril into power
last month.
   The Mass at the National Palace in this capital city, broadcast
by the state-run Television Nationale, was attended by members of
the army high command, hundreds of uniformed soldiers of the
Presidential Guard, Cabinet members, and Avril's wife and daughter.
   Television Nationale said Tuesday night that six officers and
soldiers were discharged from the army because of their role in
Sunday's coup attempt.
   Centrist politicians say the failed coup was an attempt by a
handful of soldiers close to the deposed Duvalier dynasty to regain
control after a soldiers' revolt ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy as
the national leader on Sept. 17.The revolt also forced out dozens
of unpopular officers.
   However, leftist groups claim the coup attempt was a move
engineered by Avril to get rid of soldiers demanding radical
reforms.
   Namphy took over after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to
France in February 1986, ending 29 years of repressive family rule.
Namphy left power for four months after a military-backed civilian
won national elections but seized control again earlier this year.
   The young protesters, meanwhile, accused Haiti's conservative
bishops of trying to get rid of Aristide because of his radical
sermons urging the poor to fight for social justice.
   ``It is obvious that the decision to transfer Aristide against
the manifest desire of the majority of Haitians is inexplicable
without the persistent influence of Rome on certain personalities
in Haiti,'' the Rev. Antoine Adrien, another member of the church's
radical wing, said Wednesday.
   Aristide said in a statement read by the church's Radio Soleil
that he had received an order from Rome to leave Haiti by last
Monday. However, a friend of the priest, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Aristide was still in Haiti on Wednesday.

   The Tehachapi Mountains were rattled early
Wednesday by three small aftershocks from a summer earthquake. No
damage or injuries were reported.
   The quakes occurred 11 miles north-northeast of Gorman and were
aftershocks of a June 10 quake that measured 5.4 on the Richter
scale, said Robert Finn, spokesman for California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   The first aftershock hit at 3:50 a.m. and measured 3.6, followed
by a 4.1 jolt at 6:44 a.m. and a 3.4 quake at 7:04 a.m., Finn said.
   The California Aqueduct crosses the Tehachapis but the quakes
caused no problems, said David Kessler, an official of the state
Department of Water Resources earthquake engineering department in
Sacramento.
   Sheriff's deputies reported getting a few calls from curious
residents.
   A 4.0 quake occurred at 9:08 a.m. 18 miles south-southeast of
Bishop, according to seismologists at the University of California
in Berkeley. Police received no reports of damage or injury. Bishop
is 220 miles east of Berkeley.
   At 3:47 p.m., a 3.8 earthquake occurred 27 miles north of El
Centro, an Imperial Valley town near the California-Mexico border,
Finn said. Police reported no damage.

   Winning the Nobel Prize on Wednesday gave an Illinois physicist
who plans to return to teaching a platform to promote science as
``a tremendous career to follow'' as four of six winners received
the good news in the United States.
   Johann Deisenhofer, a Dallas-based researcher, and West German
colleagues Robert Huber and Hartmut Michel won the Nobel Prize in
chemistry for work done in Germany to determine the structure of
certain proteins needed in photosynthesis.
   Michel, 42, was visiting Yale University's medical school in New
Haven, Conn., when he learned he had been selected by the Nobel
awarding committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
   ``Actually, I was starting to tremble. I had my coffee in my
hand. I had to put it away.'' Later, he delivered a scheduled
lecture to an audience whose members were not surprised their guest
had become a Nobel recipient, said Yale professor Donald Engelman.
   Deisenhofer, 45, said he was in the shower when the phone rang,
and was ``really upset'' until he learned that it was a call to
Nobel fame.
   ``I am not a quick starter in the morning. It took me about an
hour to really be sure that this was not a dream,'' he said
   Americans Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger
won the Nobel Prize in physics for research conducted at Columbia
University in 1961 into the subatomic particle called a neutrino.
   The award announcement said the work ``opened entirely new
opportunities for research into the innermost structure and
dynamics of matter.''
   The research has ``no practical significance other than very
long term,'' said Schwartz, head of Digital Pathways Inc., in
Mountain View, Calif. ``If you understand something better, sooner
or later it will be practical.''
   ``Someday some kid who is now in high school will find out how
to use this information to bring benefits to all of society,'' said
Lederman, 66, director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
in Batavia, Ill.
   With hopes of encouraging young people to get interested in
science, Lederman is giving up his job as head of the government's
atom smashing laboratory to take a teaching position at the
University of Chicago.
   University spokesman Larry Arbeiter said Lederman would in March
begin teaching not only graduate students in physics, but also
undergraduate science students and liberal arts majors.
   ``It's unusual for somebody of his stature to be teaching people
so early in their careers _ and even people who aren't scientists
at all,'' Arbeiter said. ``He's a very articulate, energetic man
and he's the perfect person to get people interested in science.''
   ``Science is a tremendous career to follow,'' Lederman said.
   ``You have fun all the time _ some blood, sweat and tears too,
but it is ultimately rewarding,'' he said.
   Each Nobel Prize carries a $390,000 award. None of the winners
announced any immediate plans for spending the money.
   Schwartz, a 55-year-old former Stanford University professor,
founded Digital Pathways in the 1970s as ``an attempt to
participate in all the excitement of Silicon Valley.'' He said the
firm deals with data communications in the security field, building
computer systems with an ability ``to keep hackers out.''
   Steinberger, 67, a German-born American citizen, is a physicist
at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, in
Geneva, Switzerland.

<HEAD>Iran Agrees POW Exchange Can Begin But Says Issues Remain</HEAD>

   Iran's U.N. ambassador said Wednesday that
Iran has no objection to starting the process of sending home all
prisoners of war from the Persian Gulf conflict and hinted the sick
and injured might be freed first.
   Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati noted, however, that some technical
issues still must be resolved in the Iran-Iraq peace talks and
repatriation cannot be completed until they are settled.
   According to the Red Cross, Iran has 50,182 prisoners from the
8-year-old conflict and Iraq 19,284. But U.N. officials and
diplomats in Iran and Iraq believe Iran has 60,000 to 70,000
prisoners and Iraq 30,000 to 50,000.
   Mahallati was responding to a proposal Iraq sent to the
International Committee of the Red Cross and to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar this week saying
repatriation could begin on humanitarian grounds if Iran
reciprocated.
   Mahallati said medical examinations and registration of all
prisoners could go forward. He said Tehran encourages the Red Cross
to continue humanitarian exchanges, which in the past have sent
home sick and injured soldiers.
   ``On our part, we are ready to cooperate with the
secretary-general and the ICRC in order to do our best to
repatriate unfortunate POWs,'' he said.
   He said the Red Cross should encourage further exchanges of
``certain categories'' of prisoners.
   But he said technical issues must be agreed upon, such as the
numbers of prisoners to be released, their ranks, whether prisoners
who were detained the longest would be freed first, the pace of
releases, and other questions.
   He said these issues ``cannot be regarded outside Resolution
598,'' the U.N. peace plan that is the basis for the peace talks.
   Iraq, however, said the releases would be on a humanitarian
basis ``unrelated to the other issues referred to in Security
Council Resolution 598.''
   Resolution 598 called for an immediate cease-fire, withdrawal of
troops to internationally recognized boundries and exchange of
prisoners.
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire began Aug. 20, but peace talks have
been deadlocked since just after they began Aug. 25.
   The talks stalled over Iraqi insistence the waterway forming
their southern border be cleared of silt and sunken ships.
   Iraq calls the passage the Shatt-al-Arab. To Iran it is the
Arvand River.
   Iran rejected the demand as a secondary issue that could be
settled later, and Mahallati made clear Wednesday that Tehran wants
withdrawal to the border to be the next step.
   Both sides have blamed each other for the stalemate in
negotiations, which Perez de Cuellar said he expects to resume next
week in Geneva.

   The former head of a suburban levee district
discriminated against a woman employee by refusing to promote her
even though she was best qualified for the job, a federal appeals
court has ruled.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a decision released
late Tuesday, said the East Jefferson Levee District must pay Sgt.
Callie Walsdorf as if she had received the promotion she was denied
in April 1984.
   John Lauricella Jr., the former district president, ``was heard
to declare, at the time he considered the candidates for the
promotion, `Ain't no bitch gonna get this job,''' the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals wrote.
   ``There may exist a more unequivocal way to express an intent to
exclude women from consideration for a promotion, but none come
readily to mind,'' the court said.
   Lauricella did not return a telephone message left at his
office. He remains a member of the district, which supervises and
maintains the flood protection levees in western New Orleans
suburbs.
   Walsdorf, whose discrimination claim had been rejected by a
lower court, also did not return a telephone message left at the
district office.
   Levee Board President Greg Gambel said Wednesday that he did not
know whether the board would appeal the ruling.
   The federal appeals court declined to order Walsdorf's promotion
to assistant district superintendent, the job in question, because
it would mean firing or demoting John T. Prados, the man Lauricella
appointed.
   ``It is undisputed that plaintiff was the most qualified
applicant. It is likewise undisputed that Prados, who was
eventually appointed to fill the vacancy, was unqualified at the
time he applied,'' the court said, noting that Prados was
Lauricella's ``life-long friend.''
   The ruling said Walsdorf later was rejected for promotion to
lieutenant, even though she had the highest score of all candidates
on a competitive examination.
   The court also Lauricella retaliated against her in five
separate incidents because she had filed charges with the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission and the state Civil Service
Commission.
   Those incidents included assigning her for six months to a job
in which she did little but run errands and refusing to begin a
meeting of district employees until she and the officer who
testified about Lauricella's discriminatory comment had left.
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald A. Fonseca found that Lauricella had
retaliated against Walsdorf but awarded her only $1 in damages and
cut her attorneys' fees by 60 percent because he said she had not
proved discrimination.

   A television news helicopter crashed and
broke into pieces Wednesday, killing the pilot-reporter and a
photographer, apparently after the aircraft snagged a power line,
the station reported.
   KUSA-TV said pilot Leo Galanis and photographer Brian Hostetler
were returning to Denver from the scene of a plane crash on Monarch
Pass in west-central Colorado. The helicopter crash occurred about
2:20 p.m. about 15 miles southwest of metropolitan Denver.
   A Public Service Co. of Colorado helicopter pilot sent to check
out a report of a downed power line discovered the crash in a
remote, hilly area and found no signs of life in the wreckage,
utility company officials said.
   It was the sixth serious helicopter incident since Denver
television news stations began using the aircraft for news
gathering more than 10 years ago.
   A pilot and an aviation mechanic working for another station
were killed in 1982 when their copter went down while flying
through a snowstorm to the scene of a plane crash. The other
previous incidents, three involving KUSA helicopters, were forced
or crash landings that resulted in at least four injuries total.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun, head of the Christian
military government, accused Syria on Wednesday of usurping
Lebanon's sovereignty in his strongest condemnation to date of the
Damascus government.
   Aoun denied charges by Lebanon's rival pro-Syrian Moslem Cabinet
that he was blocking a settlement of a monthlong constitutional
crisis that threatens to divide the country into sectarian cantons.
   ``We should regain our sovereignty from the Syrian brothers,
because they have been directly ruling Lebanon,'' Aoun said in an
interview with The Associated Press at the presidential palace at
Baabda, northeast of Beirut.
   ``The Syrians rule the streets, the police stations and the
(district) governors, in the hope of controlling the head of
state,'' he said. ``There won't be a sound relationship between
Lebanon and Syria unless Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon.''
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon with 40,000 troops in
70 percent of the country.
   Rival governments emerged here after Parliament failed to elect
a successor to President Amin Gemayel when his six-year term ended
Sept. 23. Gemayel named Aoun as prime minister of a caretaker
Cabinet, although that position is traditionally occupied by a
Moslem. The existing Moslem Cabinet of Prime Minister Salim Hoss
refused to step down.
   Aoun, a 52-year-old Maronite Catholic, was dressed in camouflage
fatigues during Wednesday's interview.
   He waved his fist for emphasis while declaring that his Cabinet
will continue to rule ``until a new president is elected.''
   ``We shall preserve Lebanon's unity,'' he said.
   Parliament has failed three times since Aug. 18 to gather the
necessary quorum to vote in a new president. Christian members have
boycotted the sessions, saying they reject pressure to elect a
president who would turn Lebanon into a Syrian satellite.

   A 7-year-old boy was
found safe Wednesday after wandering for three days and nights in a
mountain park and was hospitalized in good condition, authorities
said.
   Jesus Antonio ``Pepin'' Garcia of Mexicali was found by a Marine
searcher nearly two miles from the Green Valley Falls campsite
where he disappeared on Sunday, said San Diego sheriff's Deputy
Christie Guerin.
   The youngster, dressed only in jeans, sneakers and a T-shirt,
was flown by helicopter to Children's Hospital in San Diego, where
he is listed in ``good to fair condition,'' hospital spokeswoman
Vickie Hearst said.
   ``It looks like he just has some superficial scratches,'' Hearst
said. ``He'll be in (the hospital) for observation, but I don't
know how long it will be. He's hungry. He asked for a hamburger.''
   More than 200 inmate volunteers, Marines and sheriff's deputies
joined in the search for Pepin, who became separated from his
family during a pine-cone hunting expedition after they arrived at
the eastern San Diego County park.
   The search began when the youngster failed to return with his
twin brother, Fernando, and a 4-year-old friend, Efren Chavez, to
the family campsite in the mountain park some 40 miles east of San
Diego.

   More than three dozen cruise missiles once
capable of wreaking nuclear havoc have been destroyed, completing a
weapons death sentence Wednesday imposed under a Soviet-American
arms treaty.
   Under the watch of Soviet inspectors, the last of 41 Air Force
ground-launched cruise missiles targeted for destruction was
dismantled at 5:45 p.m., cut apart by handheld saws and plasma arc
torches at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, said Air Force spokesman
Capt. Chuck Roque.
   In addition, 41 protective canisters for the mobile weapons, and
seven launch vehicles, called transporter erector launchers, had
been halved, he said. Only seven launchers were set for destruction
during the current Soviet elimination inspection.
   ``As far as I can tell everybody's happy,'' Roque said. ``Things
are progressing smoothly. The Soviets are seeing what they have to
see. I'm sure they're pleased, though I haven't talked to them.
There doesn't seem to be any problem.''
   The completion was well ahead of the original Friday estimate,
72 hours after the 9 a.m. Tuesday arrival of 11 Soviet inspectors.
   The Soviets' departure for Travis Air Force Base in California,
from where they will return home, is set for about noon Thursday,
Roque said.
   Under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, 443 Air
Force land-based cruise missiles, many of which have been deployed
in Europe, are to be destroyed within the pact's first three years.
   In addition, 403 Army Pershing missiles are slated for
destruction, along with 1,846 Soviet missiles of six types.
   Teams of civilian workers assigned to the Air Force's Aerospace
Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan worked in
eight-hour shifts around the clock, while at least four Soviets
remained at the open-air compound until 7 a.m., when the others
returned, a spokeswoman said earlier.
   On Tuesday, Soviet and American generals watched the destruction
of the first cruise missile. They expressed confidence that the
work would lead to more understanding between their countries.
   Soviet Army Major Gen. Vladimir Medvedev, who heads the Soviet
on-site inspection agency, also said more needs to be done to
expand arms control horizons to strategic, conventional and
chemical weapons.
   He said the INF treaty ``is one of the most critical steps''
toward ending the Cold War. Speaking through an interpreter,
Medvedev said watching destruction of a weapon that could have been
used against his country was ``an unusual event and I completely
feel it.''
   He added, ``I think such acts will make us much closer.''
   Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, Medvedev's American counterpart, said
on-site inspections will result in more military contacts for the
countries, ``more knowledge and hopefully more understanding,'' and
should generate ``more confidence and predictability in our
relations.''
   He said minimal tension involved with 146 inspections conducted
by both sides showed ``a lot of flexibility and an amazing amount
of good will on both sides.''
   Warheads from the missiles being destroyed have been removed for
storage by the Department of Energy, along with fuel and guidance
systems, officials said.

   NASA unleashed more than 100,000
horsepower Wednesday in the first major firing of a large rocket
engine at the Marshall Space Flight Center in almost 20 years.
   Singer John Denver watched the 15-second static firing with
Marshall Director J.R. Thompson and the several hundred other
people and then commented, ``With the technology behind that and
the power it put out, it's spectacular.''
   The firing was held so that the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration could test new propulsion technology hardware and
ideas applicable to liquid oxygen-hydrogen engines. Officials said
the engines should provide more reliability and lower costs for
future space missions.
   The $43 million engine, positioned upright on a test stand,
burned 1,400 gallons of liquid oxygen and 3,800 gallons of
hydrogen, producing a huge ball of flame below the engine which
turned into steam when it hit water in the cooling tank below.
   A 45-second test of the engine is scheduled sometime next month
at the same test stand, which cost close to $10 million in
modifications for the current series of firings.
   Denver came to the space center as part of a three-day
celebration of the recent successful firing of the Discovery space
shuttle. He will be joined Thursday and Friday by the five-man crew
of Discovery, the nation's first space shuttle mission in more than
2{ years.
   The last large firing of a big rocket engine at Marshall was a
Saturn test on Feb. 13, 1969, in preparation for manned flights to
the moon.

   Three Vietnam veterans vowed Wednesday to
court arrest in Laos in a bid to publicize claims the U.S.
government ignores evidence that some Americans captured in the
conflict are still alive.
   ``This government, this administration, has failed miserably in
their stated highest national priority, the prisoner-of-war
issue,'' said Ted Sampley, chairman of the National Steering
Committee for American War Veterans, a private veterans' lobby
based in Kinston, N.C.
   American authorities are so eager for cooperation from Laos and
Vietnam in digging up old U.S. warplane crash sites for traces of
the dead that they conceal or ignore information about those still
living, Sampley told a news conference.
   State Department officials disputed the accusations.
   Sampley said both Indochinese and U.S. sources have provided
evidence about living American POWs in Vietnam and Laos.
   He said he and two fellow veterans will cross the Mekong from
Thailand to Laos early next month unless the Laotian government
frees two North Carolina activists arrested Oct. 3 for illegal
entry, James Copp of Hampstead and Donna Long of Jacksonville.
Sampley, a former sergeant in the U.S. Army special forces, said he
would be accompanied by ex-U.S. Marines Jim Solomon and Bill
Sullivan.
   State Department Press Officer Alex Almasov said the department
believes that while there is no proof of Americans detained against
their will, the possibility still exists.

   A man thought by authorities to be the No. 2
leader and military strategist of the Shining Path guerrillas was
imprisoned for a maximum 15 years Wednesday for ordering terrorist
attacks that killed five policemen.
   Elsewhere, suspected Shining Path assassins shot and killed two
miners in who opposed a strike, police said Wednesday.
   One miner was shot Monday and another Tuesday in their homes
near La Oroya, a metal refining center 90 miles east of Lima,
police said.
   A three-judge tribunal imposed the sentence against Osman
Morote, 42, after finding him guilty of being the ``intellectual
author'' of several attacks by the Maoist-oriented Shining Path in
Lima state in 1981-82.
   Morote was arrested in Lima last June.
   At his first trial, Morote was cleared of other terrorist
charges for lack of evidence. He still faces six trials in Lima and
provincial capitals for murder and terrorism in attacks stretching
throughout the 1980s.
   The 8-year-old Shining Path insurgency, which is fighting to
topple the democratic government and installing Marxist rule, has
claimed more than 12,000 lives and caused $10 billion in damage,
according to the government.
   The Lima tribunal said violence dictated by Morote included an
attack on a police post on Lima's outskirts in which four officers
were slain and a bank bombing that killed one officer.
   Peruvian law prohibits capital punishment. As amended in 1987,
the law sets 25 years in prison as the maximum term for terrorist
crimes. But the tribunal ruled Morote was subject to the 15-year
maximum in effect when the crimes were committed in the early 1980s.

<HEAD>Shroud Of Turin Boosted Then Deflated By Science</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Science brought the Shroud of Turin into
prominence and now science has shoved it back toward obscurity.
   Despite the turn-about, the puzzling cloth doubtlessly will
remain to many an object of fascination.
   However, results disclosed last week from radiocarbon tests show
the shroud is only about 700 years old and could not be the burial
cloth of Jesus in the first century.
   Many had believed the cloth was the one used to wrap Jesus' body
after his crucifixion and at the time of his resurrection _ a
belief that had been strengthened by previous scientific findings.
   But the latest tests at three separate laboratories in Britain,
the U.S. and Switzerland, using highly sensitive dating techniques,
find the shroud dated from between 1260 to 1390.
   Nevertheless, the mystery of the image on the cloth remains. It
shows, as in a photographic negative, the front and back of a
scourged, crucified man. Scientists have been unable to determine
how it got there.
   A 32-member U.S. research team concluded in 1981, after spending
five days subjecting the shroud to a wide range of tests, that the
image is not the product of an artist and that it bears blood
stains.
   But what caused ``the image is an ongoing mystery,'' the report
said.
   That question also remained unanswered by the latest radiocarbon
tests.
   The Rev. Adam Otterbein, head of the Holy Shroud Guild, says
there are many other unresolved questions, such as previous
research claims that the image showed first-century coins over the
victim's eyes.
   Some scientists previously had suggested that the image was made
by a sudden, intense blaze of light, such as that mentioned by
Scripture at the time of the resurrection.
   Others have theorized the image was caused by radiation, or by
some sort of still unexplained chemical reaction between body
secretions and the cloth, but that they have not been able to
duplicate the effect by such processes.
   The history of the 14-by-4-foot-long linen shroud can be traced
to 1354, when it was deposited in Lirey, France, by a French
nobleman who participated in Crusades to the Holy Land.
   The cloth has been kept since 1578 in Turin, Italy, where the
Catholic archbishop of Turin is its official guardian.
   It drew little attention until scientific investigations of it
began about the turn of the century, starting with 1898 photographs
revealing the image on the shroud had characteristics of a
photographic negative.
   Since that time, various studies accumulated so extensively that
they took on a technical name, ``siconology'' (shroud study). But
testing of the cloth itself generally was not allowed since its
keepers feared damage to it.
   But that changed dramatically in 1978 when scientists of the U.
S. Shroud of Turin Research Project were allowed to conduct various
chemical, photographic and computerized tests.
   Taking three years to correlate their results, they concluded in
1981 that the image of the crucified figure had not been forged by
an artist, but they were uncertain how it got there.
   Some team members said the accumulating evidence pointed to the
shroud's authenticity, including former team spokesman, computer
engineer Kenneth Stevenson, and a theological consultant, Gary
Habermas.
   In a book, ``Verdict on the Shroud,'' they said the ``converging
evidence is not proof, but it does show that the literal, physical
resurrection of Jesus is the best explanation'' for peculiarities
of the shroud.
   They contended the most probable cause of the image was a heat
and light scorch from some ``extraordinary phenomenon'' not part of
natural processes. Other team members declined to draw such
conclusions.
   In 1986, Pope John Paul II gave the go-ahead for the radiocarbon
dating, which was carried out independently on tiny bits of the
shroud by the three separate institutions, with the results
considered 95 percent accurate.
   All three institutions, the University of Arizona, Oxford
University in England and the Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich, dated the cloth in the Middle Ages.
   ``I see no reason for the church to put these results in
doubt,'' Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero of Turin told a news
conference But he said the results ``do not close the book on the
shroud.
   ``This is but another chapter in the shroud's story, or as some
would say, in the mystery of the shroud.''

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A King's College political scientist

America, the ``Catholic lobby'' also is fragmented.
   The Rev. Thomas J. O`Hare, who has examined 31 separate
Washington-based Catholic interest groups advocating various public

Catholic lobby ``a monolith.''
   ``That really is a distorted view,'' he says. O'Hare, who has
written a chapter on the multifaceted Catholic lobby in a new book,
``Religion in American Politics,'' says:
   ``There are Catholic pacifists, feminists, traditionalist and
advocates of positions on many policy issues. Some are to the left

severe financial strain from continued ownership of television

   ``The financial resources of the diocese have been severely

   He said efforts have failed over the last three years to sell
the UHF station, Channel 18, which went on the air in 1984, and the
``continuing demands caused by its operations'' have forced
reductions in diocesan services to parishes.
   The bishop said the cutbacks, however, would not affect regular

<HEAD>Cole Porter Can-Cans His Way To The London Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Paris of the 1890s is high-kicking its way
across the London stage, as a new production of Cole Porter's
``Can-Can'' furthers Britain's love affair with the American
musical.
   ``You can't get better music than Porter, (and) you certainly
can't get better lyrics than Porter,'' producer Lovett Bickford
said of the show whose songs include ``C'est Magnifique,''
``Allez-Vous-En'' and ``I Love Paris.''
   He added in an interview that the musical's name was one of its
primary virtues. ``Can-Can'' refers to the spirited and rowdy dance
women performed in Paris nightspots, involving high kicks and
flirty exposures of lacy undergarments. The musical takes place at
the Montmartre nightclub, Le Bal du Paradis, presided over by the
musical's heroine, Mme. Pistache.
   The production, budgeted at just under $1.7 million, opens Oct.
26 at the Strand Theater. It's one of a wave of American musicals
to recently play the West End, following ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' ``Annie
Get Your Gun,'' ``South Pacific'' and ``Brigadoon.''
   Donna McKechnie, who originated the role of Cassie in Broadway's
``A Chorus Line,'' stars as the leggy Pistache, who is romantically
pursued by the same judge who wants to close Le Bal du Paradis for
being ``immoral.''
   Milo O'Shea and Bernard Alane head the supporting cast. Janie
Dee plays Claudine, the role that launched Gwen Verdon to stardom
when ``Can-Can'' made its Broadway bow in 1953.
   David Taylor directs, with choreography by Kenn Oldfield.
   The show was seen in London in 1954 and revived on Broadway, to
mixed reviews, in 1981. A road company version, starring Chita
Rivera and The Rockettes from Radio City Music Hall, is currently
touring the United States.
   However, Bickford said his version was less a revival than a
complete revision. ``For all intents and purposes, this is a new
show,'' he said.
   He has hired lyricist Julian More of ``Irma La Douce'' and
``Expresso Bongo'' fame to rewrite the book by the late Abe
Burrows, the musical's original director.
   ``We've strengthened the romantic element, lessened the
comedy,'' he said. ``We're trying to make a comment about hypocrisy
_ moral hypocrisy, sexual hypocrisy, business hypocrisy _ that is
as applicable today as it was in the 1890s.''
   McKechnie called the show ``a bittersweet love story, with a
happy ending, naturally.''
   She was approached by Bickford to do ``Can-Can'' when she was on
tour in Boston last year with the Bob Fosse musical, ``Sweet
Charity.'' The 47-year-old Detroit-born performer said she had few
qualms about inheriting a role often played by genuine Frenchwomen.
Shirley Maclaine had the part in the 1960 movie, which also starred
Maurice Chevalier, Juliet Prowse, Frank Sinatra and Louis Jourdan.
   ``We don't use the French accent; we don't do `'allo, 'allo,'''
she said. ``It's American, but I say things with the lilt of a
French feeling.''
   McKechnie made her Broadway debut in 1961 as a dancer in Abe
Burrows' ``How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.'' She
said she was pleased, almost three decades later, to be working
again on one of his shows.
   ``It's another full circle,'' she said. ``I adored Abe. He was
the first director that really encouraged me.''
   ``Can-Can'' marks her fourth appearance on the West End stage,
following runs in ``Promises, Promises'' and ``Company,'' and a
short engagement in 1977 in ``A Chorus Line.''
   ``The theater business is London and New York, and we're doing a
lot of shows together,'' she said. ``London's like a second home to
me. It's very close now.''
   The role itself also appeals to McKechnie, who has been
associated almost exclusively with ``A Chorus Line,'' the
longest-running Broadway show ever. She originated the part of the
anguished hoofer Cassie, and was briefly married to the show's
director-choreographer Michael Bennett, who died last year of AIDS.
   ``This is a very important part for me,'' she said. ``It opens a
whole other genre of roles _ the kind I used to think of as a young
dancer on Broadway, when I'd look up at the big stars hoping to
grow into those roles, if I can last.''

<HEAD>Police Still Baffled By 1978 Disappearance Of Five Teens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of five missing teen-agers has
baffled police for a decade, and the trail has taken investigators
through youth hostels, branches of the military and even into the
cult suicides by followers of Jim Jones in Guyana.
   But the search has been to no avail.
   Randy Johnson, Melvin Pittman, Alvin Turner, Michael McDowell
and Ernest Taylor _ all 16- and 17-year-olds from the Newark area _
disappeared without a trace Aug. 20, 1978.
   Don Griffin, associate director of the National Network of
Runaway and Youth Services in Washington, said that he has never
encountered a case like this one.
   ``There are lots of instances where a group of young people will
do something that will make them decide to take off,'' he said.
``But unless foul play came to them, they usually come back. At
least one of them should have gotten homesick and called home.''
   The only real lead came a few days after they disappeared when a
male voice on the telephone offered to tell Sarah Johnson the
whereabouts of her son and his four missing friends in exchange for
$750.
   The call was traced to a pay phone at Union Station in
Washington, D.C., and police eventually decided it was made by the
five boys who had run away from home and were trying to get some
money.
   But nobody has ever heard again from the five _ now grown to
adulthood if they are alive.
   ``We talked to police all over the country, we checked with the
military, religious cults. We even checked with federal agents
about the bodies flown back from the Jim Jones suicides in
Guyana,'' said Detective Everett Hairston, who has been on the case
since the five were first reported missing.
   ``Now we just hope that someday someone will call about them,''
he said.
   The five all hung around together that summer and several of
them had grown up in the same neighborhood, Hairston said. He said
they were ``basically good kids, not rowdy, and they had fairly
stable home lives.''
   Before Mrs. Johnson and the families of the other four
teen-agers decided to stop granting interviews on the subject, she
said that ``the only thing that keeps me going is God almighty. But
every time I sit down for my dinner I get full thinking about my
son and thinking maybe he's starving.''
   She said she especially misses him around 9 p.m., ``when I could
always hear the basketball bouncing, bouncing, bouncing as he
walked home from the park.''
   Shooting baskets at West Side Park was the last place anyone saw
all five of the boys together that day. Hairston said they finished
playing about 4 p.m. and were picked up by Lee Anthony Evans, a
handyman who often hired the teen-agers to help him with odd jobs.
   Evans told police he dropped the boys off on a street corner
near an ice cream parlor. Later that night, Michael McDowell
returned to his home in East Orange and changed clothes, hopping
back into a waiting pickup truck with at least one other boy inside.
   That was the last confirmed sighting of any of the five.
   Hairston said Evans, known to the teen-agers as Big Man, was
exhaustively investigated. ``We followed that guy for months, gave
him a lie detector test, and he came up clean.''
   Hairston said he has run through every hypothetical situation he
could come up with. If they had stolen a car and crashed into a
river, for instance, the bodies would likely have been found by
now. If they had robbed a bank or ended up in prison, there would
have been a record.
   The same applies for military enlistment. He's checked with
police in Atlanta and Chicago, where mass murderers took young
victims. Still no trace.
   ``We have no physical evidence to suggest they are dead, and so
the case remains open,'' Hairston said.
   His office has had little contact lately with the parents, who
have said they don't want to talk publicly about the case now.
   ``I think the parents have continued with their lives,''
Hairston said. ``But they still have a sense of hope.''

<HEAD>Snow Doesn't Have A Chance Of Sticking In Downtown Holland</HEAD>

   Best known for growing tulips in the
spring, this Dutch town soon may be famous for melting snow in the
winter.
   When the snow begins to fall _ and an average of 100 inches fall
here each winter _ warm water from the city's power plant will be
pumped through a grid of plastic pipes underneath downtown streets
and sidewalks, melting the snow and ice.
   No longer will customers dread looking for parking spots between
huge mounds of shoveled snow or risk slipping on icy patches as
they window shop. Gone will be the days shopkeepers spend more time
behind a shovel than a cash register.
   The project, called ``snowmelt,'' is similar to systems used for
decades in northern Europe and Scandinavian countries.
   But the one being installed under streets and sidewalks along
three downtown blocks here is the largest of its kind in the United
States, according to the system's engineers. It's expected to be
completed in time for the first snowfall.
   Underground systems that use electricity or steam are being used
on a smaller scale, such as in driveways and parking lots of
various U.S. cities, said Pieter Dekker, project director for the
city's Board of Public Works.
   A larger snowmelt system using water is being installed at a
Minneapolis mall to replace an aging underground heating-mat
system, but that won't be completed until 1991.
   ``It's designed so that the snow melts almost instantaneously as
it hits the ground,'' Dekker said. ``In theory, there should never
be an accumulation.''
   When the project was introduced earlier this year, it was met
with skepticism _ especially among downtown shopkeepers displeased
with having to share its $1.1 million pricetag with the city.
   But when local industrialist Edgar Prince, who has a
mini-snowmelt system in his private driveway, agreed to kick in
$250,000 for the project and $25,000 a year toward the annual
$100,000 operating costs, store owners warmed to the idea.
   Holland already had committed itself to a $2 million downtown
beautification project that was going to demolish streets to put in
new brick sidewalks, landscaping and mini-parks as well new utility
and sewer lines.
   The warm water to be used in system is a byproduct of the power
plant, which is less than a mile from downtown and is now dumping
the water in Lake Macatawa.
   The water will wind through the 58 twisted miles of plastic
pipes at a constant temperature of 51 degrees year-round, but may
be turned up during heavy snowfalls.
   Already, officials from other communities are visiting Holland
to find out more about the snowmelt system.
   ``Historically, older downtowns die when shopping malls come in;
the core of the city becomes an eyesore of abandoned buildings,''
said John Hutchinson, former chairman of the city's Mainstreet
Committee. The committee was formed three years ago when the city
was designated a ``Main Street'' community by the National Trust
for Historic Preservation.
   Since then, developers have taken advantage of low-interest
loans to renovate decaying facades of older buildings, instead of
tearing them down to build new ones.
   ``We're determined that Holland, Mich., is not going to follow
that pattern,'' said Hutchinson, an attorney whose wife owns a
downtown children's clothing shop.
   While Holland's attempts to revitalize its downtown and compete
with suburban shopping malls are noteworthy, a strong foundation
already was in place.
   The city's tulip festival draws hundreds of thousands of
visitors each May, its state park beach on Lake Michigan is
considered Michigan's busiest, and Holland's Dutch heritage _
reflected in wooden shoe shops and windmills _ has made it a
popular stop for tourists.
   Most shopkeepers are enthusiastic about the snowmelt system,
even as construction temporarily deters customers.
   But some aren't so sure.
   ``The problem is you won't see the pavement unless you go there.
And the people who don't like to go downtown won't go there in the
middle of winter just because the snow melts,'' said Tim Jenks, a
small-business consultant and former Mainstreet Committee member.
   Still, with proper promotion, its novelty could make it a
success, he said. ``I believe you can bring people downtown with a
snowmelt system or with a three-humped camel. It's all a matter of
how you promote it.''

<HEAD>Excessive Use Makes Japan Massive Importer of Blood Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors use such huge amounts of blood products,
despite criticism from the government and medical experts, that
some news reports call Japan ``the vampire of the world.''
   Its 122 million people consume up to one-third the world's
available supplies, which makes enormous imports necessary.
   Critics say many patients are given blood products when other
treatments would be both effective and cheaper.
   ``The problem is that Japan has been using too much serum
albumin,'' said Masao Nakashima, chief of the Health and Welfare
Ministry's blood program.
   Serum albumin is a protein component of blood. A low albumin
level can be caused by burns or malfunctions of the liver and
kidneys.
   A government-sponsored committee that investigated consumption
of blood products two years ago said doctors often use the
expensive products when medication is more appropriate.
   ``The committee reported that albumin is often used as a
nutrient, although albumin is not effective for that purpose,''
Nakashima said. His ministry has not issued guidelines limiting the
use of blood products to certain symptoms.
   Toshiharu Yamaguchi, a surgeon at Kyoto Prefectural University
of Medicine, gave another example: ``To improve low protein in
blood after an operation, many doctors administer albumin although
amino acid can be used instead.''
   ``It's only Japan that uses so much albumin,'' he added. ``I
guess part of the reason is that the health insurance system here
can offer (it) cheaper than abroad.''
   Nearly all Japanese belong either to private health plans that
pay 90 percent of medical expenses for salaried workers or a
government plan that pays 70 percent for the unemployed or
self-employed.
   Under the 90 percent formula, treatment with blood products can
cost the patient only 470 to 1,000 yen _ about $4 to $8.
   Yamaguchi attributed the abuse to medical custom and inadequate
government guidelines.
   Nakashima said, ``In the end, it's all up to physicians'
decisions.''
   He said blood donations in Japan meet the demand for whole-blood
transfusions, but about 90 percent of the products used are
imported, primarily from the the United States. All imports since
1985 have been heat-treated to guard against AIDS and hepatitis.
   To reach self-sufficiency, Nakashima's ministry has begun a
campaign to reduce annual imports by March 1991 to 1 million
liters, or about 2.1 million pints, from the current 5.6 million
pints.
   More donations may be hard to achieve because people began
shunning donor buses and centers after the first case of acquired
immune deficiency symdrome was identified in Japan three years ago.
Nakashima said some people think they can get AIDS, for which no
cure has been found, by giving blood.
   The Japan Red Cross, the only organization allowed to collect
blood, received 3.9 million pints from 8.2 million donors in 1987.
   ``Although the number of donors in Japan is not any smaller than
other countries, most people donate only the minimum requirement of
200cc (0.43 pint), whereas the United States and European countries
require more,'' Nakashima said.

<HEAD>Contrary to Fears, Junk Bond Funds Still Shining</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors who ignored many dire warnings and
stuck with so-called ``junk'' or ``high yield'' bond mutual funds
have been rewarded for their faith so far this year.
   As a group, these funds have outperformed funds that concentrate
on top-quality corporate bonds or on government securities, through
a dicey period when many financial advisers were urging extreme
caution.
   For the nine months through Sept. 30, high-yield funds averaged
a total return (yield plus change in net asset value) of 9.6
percent, according to Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the advisory
letter No-Load Fund Investor.
   That compared with a return of 7.4 percent for funds confining
themselves to investment grade bonds, which are rated as much less
prone to default and therefore substantially safer.
   The junk bond funds recently were yielding 11.6 percent,
significantly higher than the 7.9 percent yield available on
investment-grade bond funds, Jacobs added.
   If you had tried to tell many of the experts last winter that
the results would turn out that way, you probably would have found
yourself in an argument.
   The stock market crash last fall raised fears of an economic
slump that would strain the ability of many companies with lower
credit ratings to meet their obligations.
   Analysts pointed out that the junk bond market, which has grown
from about $60 billion to $180 billion just since the start of
1985, had never been subjected to the acid test of a recession.
   It still hasn't. ``Widespread fears that investors in the high
yield market would suffer severe losses have been unfounded,''
declares the Alliance for Capital Access, a group that represents
many companies that have issued these bonds.
   ``This year the market has significantly outperformed the
Treasury bond market, the investment-grade bond market and the
stock market, as it did in 1987,'' said David Aylward, the group's
executive director.
   Does that mean that conservative investors who stick with
government-guaranteed bonds or bank certificates of deposit are
missing a bet? Not necessarily, says Jacobs.
   Jacobs is well aware of studies finding that the extra yield
investors get in a diversified portfolio of junk bonds more than
compensates them over time for losses suffered when individual
defaults occur.
   ``Risk, as always, has its reward,'' he says. ``People investing
in lower-rated bonds receive greater rewards OVER THE LONG RUN than
investors selecting investment-quality bonds.
   ``Nevertheless, a good investment over the long run is not
necessarily a good investment in the immediate future.''
   For one thing, he says, figures compiled by the investment firm
of Salomon Brothers show that the yield advantage offered by junk
bonds over Treasury bonds has narrowed of late, to less than 3
percentage points from nearly 4 points early this year.
   ``Experts in the field anticipate that the supply of new issues
may soon increase,'' he adds. If that happens, the shift in the
supply-demand balance could exert downward pressure on junk bond
prices.
   ``In sum,'' Jacobs says, ``we believe this is a time for
caution. While current economic data are strong, recessions have a
way of arriving unannounced, and even conservatively positioned
funds could have losses in that eventuality.''
   It seems certain that many financial advisers will remain
skeptical about high-yield bonds and funds until experience can
show how they weather a period of economic decline.
   A few scattered defaults would be no big problem for investors
owning junk bond funds. A more widespread credit crisis would be
another matter entirely.

<HEAD>Markie Post Plays `Shady Ladies' in TV Movies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Markie Post is temporarily abandoning her
white bread, vanilla pudding image from NBC's ``Night Court'' to
play shady ladies in two television movies.
   She's a casino singer in ``Glitz,'' an NBC movie based on Elmore
Leonard's detective thriller that will be broadcast Friday, and a
hooker in the CBS comedy ``Tricks of the Trade.''
   ``They're shady ladies,'' said Post, who plays defense attorney
Christine Sullivan on ``Night Court.'' ``You can only get shadier
with Christine. There's nowhere else to go, she's so pure.''
   In ``Glitz,'' Jimmy Smits of ``L.A. Law'' stars as Vincent Mora,
a Miami detective who tracks the killer of a call girl through the
gambling casinos of Atlantic City and Puerto Rico. Post is the
murdered woman's former roommate and becomes romantically involved
with the detective.
   ``I read the book when it came out and knew I wanted to play the
role of Linda Moon,'' said Post. ``It's like a 1980s Raymond
Chandler gumshoe story. Well, it's Elmore Leonard. Linda is
independent. I call her a broad.
   ``She knows the ways of the casinos. She's got a lot of heart
and guts. I first described her as definitely not a California
girl. She doesn't drink Perrier, eat sushi or jog. She falls in
love with Jimmy Smits, who's recovering from a bullet wound in
Puerto Rico. He's not sure he wants to go back. He's wasting away
in Margaritaville.''
   Linda takes a singing job in a casino in Atlantic City, where
Mora follows in his search for the killer.
   ``I like to think of it as bringing Jimmy back to life,'' Post
said. ``He's not looking for love. I don't want to get involved,
but I spill my guts to him and fall in love. Then he falls in
love.''
   Post said she was pleased she was offered the role without
having to read for it. ``They did want to see some film,'' she
said, ``so I sent them something from `Night Court' and `The
Gangster Chronicles.' I was a prostitute in that. I played Lucky
Luciano's old girlfriend.
   ``I was also offered `Tricks of the Trade.' I'm a hooker and
Cindy Williams is a Brentwood housewife. We get together to solve a
crime. John Ritter's also in it. It's an out-and-out comedy. What's
different from `Night Court,' though, is that I'm not the straight
man. I'd one of the people Dan Fielding (the lecherous prosecutor
of ``Night Court,'' played by John Larroquette) would go for.
   ``Her name's Marla Waleski and she wears a leather bustier,
leopard-spotted Spandex pants and red boots. It was really neat to
work with another woman. We could talk girl talk between takes.''
   Post also is back at work on ``Night Court,'' which has been
moved to Wednesday. Harry Anderson also stars as Judge Harry Stone.
   ``Christine's in love with Harry, but they can never get
together,'' she said. ``Whenever he gets another girlfriend I'm
always personally jealous. I say let me be a spoilsport. Or let us
both get knocked on the head and get together for at least one
episode.
   ``I don't think Christine's changed. I'm more inclined to slap
her these days. She's so positive. She hasn't changed, but the
public's seen more sides of her. Last year, Harry saw a little scar
over my eye. I'd never noticed it before. I spent the whole show
holding a hand over my eye. She's so vain.''
   She admits that the show's writers are shaping Christine close
to her own personality. ``I do love Prince Charles and Lady
Diana,'' she said. ``They've picked up on that. Christine had a
party celebrating their wedding anniversary.''
   Before ``Night Court'' she starred in ``The Fall Guy'' as the
person who gave Lee Majors his jobs. She compares the role to the
tape recorder on ``Mission: Impossible.''
   She grew up in Palo Alto, where her father was a nuclear
physicist and her mother a poet. She's married to actor Michael
Ross and they have a 16-month-old daughter, Kate.

   A Long Journey From The Four Seasons To Phoenix House
</TEXT>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For three decades, the world of fast-lane, fancy
restaurants was Stuart Levin's oyster. Then, multiple sclerosis
struck, taking the oyster but leaving a pearl Levin discovered in
himself and some young recovering drug addicts.
   It took guts and insight and pain to find the gem.
   A couple of years ago, when his multiple sclerosis was at its
worst, Levin sat in his apartment, just sat, day after day. One
morning, as he watched some teen-agers horsing around outside, he
said: ``I thought about how far I had come, and I said, `Dammit, I
can't do nothing. And I was doing nothing.''
   And he thought of the young people at Phoenix House Foundation.
Levin once had helped a friend, Phoenix House President Dr.
Mitchell M. Rosenthal, set up a dinner for donors to the drug
treatment agency.
   Levin _ who had managed The Four Seasons, one of Manhattan's
plushest places to dine, and catered to the Kennedys, among other
things _ trained young people in Rosenthal's program as cooks, bus
boys and waiters for the night.
   So, now Levin called on Rosenthal.
   ``I told him, `I can't walk and I can't run, but I can talk and
I can think. Maybe there's something I can do to further their
lives.'''
   ``And I was being selfish. I needed them.''
   ``We all felt it was a wonderful opportunity to have a man of
Stuart's experience,'' said Rosenthal. ``He's just a wonderful
teacher.''
   Levin and Phoenix House officials settled on a restaurant
service program, which began just over a year ago with Levin
devoting one day a week to teaching recovering drug addicts skills
they needed to work in restaurants, skills that would enable them
to earn a good living when they left Phoenix House.
   One day soon became five _ all volunteer _ and one program
became two. In one, students at a Phoenix House residential high
school and treatment program learn cooking and other aspects of
food service. In the other, which included opening a dining room
with lunch service for employees at Phoenix House headquarters,
people ages 21 to 26 learn dining room service.
   But Levin teaches more.
   ``I teach a way of life, what it is to have patience, what it is
to have understanding, to share experiences. For these young people
to be part of our society, they have to learn,'' Levin said.
   ``No one had time for these kids when they were growing up. I
have time for them _ I have all the time in the world. They are my
life.''
   Tony May, who owns San Domenico restaurant and hired one of
Levin's students, says: ``The Stuart Levin I've seen recently is
the same Stuart Levin I knew 20 years ago. ... His enthusiasm, the
way he moves, the way he pushes. He's the same man to me.''
   ``He's a different kind of person, a man who came from the
top,'' said student Gameal Abdo, 22. ``He teaches the right way,
how it's supposed to be done out in the real world.''
   ``We love him _ for someone to put themselves out for kids like
us ...,'' said Jeffrey McGee, 19.
   ``A lot of people might feel the same way, but he shows it,''
adds Andrew Galloway, 20.
   ``We've had our trials and tribulations on the street, but we've
come a long way and for him to see us as people ... that counts,''
said Lorraine Johnson, 19.
   Levin, 58, teaches what he knows best, what he learned over 35
years.
   Besides being the first resident manager at The Four Seasons, he
was president of Le Pavillon, now closed but once considered among
the country's best restaurants, and he opened the Top of the Park,
high above Central Park.
   A ``Stuart Levin Day'' was once proclaimed in New York City.
   The mementos of that life take up five walls of Levin's
apartment. Mixed in with certificates of appreciation, photographs
with famous people and awards are pictures of his two children and
their children, his parents, himself as a child.
   The mementos of his new life are on the coffee table: a poem, a
letter and a card, from students.
   Of his old life, he says, ``I don't miss it. I think about it,
but I don't miss it, because my life is so full.''
   ``It's like a tree. I'm the main stalk, and my life was one
branch out here,'' he said, stretching out his left arm. ``It fell
off, so I'm starting a new life, a new branch over here.''
   He almost didn't give the new branch a chance to grow.
   There had been signs of weakness and trouble walking, but Levin
said his doctor could not find the cause. Then one morning in June
1985, Levin woke up and could not move his right side. He soon
learned he had MS.
   ``I wanted it to be fatal. I wanted to end it all. Why me?''
   Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system
that afflicts an estimated 250,000 Americans. The cause is not
known, nor is the cure, though some treatments are available.
Symptoms vary greatly from person to person, and range from blurred
vision to paralysis to confusion. It is not contagious and is
rarely fatal.
   After Levin's diagnosis, his doctor sent him to a rehabilitation
center, and Levin became determined to walk again, and without leg
braces. ``We tried. I couldn't walk. I broke down in hysterics for
one day.'' Then he put on the brace, and now he walks, with a
walker. He also sometimes uses a wheelchair.
   ``My most difficult thing is putting on my shoes in the
morning,'' he said, pointing at black lace-up shoes. ``I scream at
myself, `Come on, Stuart,' and then I get dressed and start my
day.''

   One recent day, that meant first fixing a breakfast of coffee
(``my own special blend'') and cake for three guests.
   He greets his company looking sophisticated, dapper in a blue
blazer with gold buttons, striped shirt and gray flannel slacks. A
gold bracelet on one wrist, a gold watch on the other.
   ``I eat in restaurants, go to museums, theater. I do everything,
but I had to build up confidence in myself,'' he said. ``You've got
to get on in this world and do the most you can. That's what it's
all about, what it's really all about.''
   ``But when I do go out, I think out every detail of the day and
allow for any mishaps. First off, I have to think, `Where are the
bathrooms?'''
   Just leaving his apartment building demands patience and
perseverance.
   He goes down a floor in the elevator but still must negotiate a
set of two steps and a set of three before he reaches the sidewalk.
Then there's getting in the car, the hired driver folding up the
walker and stashing it in the trunk.
   The process is repeated, in reverse, upon arrival, fewer than 10
blocks away. A short drive but a long way, from Central Park West
to the headquarters of Phoenix House Foundation.
   Levin is greeted by his students like a returning hero, but he
quickly settles them back to work.
   At the entrance to the dining room, two young people stand
straight, dressed in uniform: black pants or skirt, pressed white
shirt, a folded restaurant apron at the waist, waiters' pads and
pens in their waistbands.
   Tables are set for a feast, two forks, two spoons, just so on
the edge of the table, even though some of the Phoenix House
employees dining there are having hot dogs.
   ``The food may be rather modest _ it's not Lutece fare _ but the
kids serve it as if it were,'' said Arlene Spiller, assistant
director of public information at the foundation. Levin ``is
demanding and exacting. Before any platter is served, he inspects
it. He corrects every little thing.''
   It's Ronnie Grein's second day in the course. ``I'm like really
nervous, but Mr. Levin is making it comfortable for me to learn,''
said Grein, who came to Phoenix House four months ago as a
condition of probation.
   Grein and Levin hit it off immediately.
   ``I took his hands and I said I love you. I love you for being
here,'' Levin recalled. The next day was Grein's 22nd birthday, and
Levin brought a card.
   ``I don't think anyone ever gave him a birthday card before,''
Levin said, breaking into tears. ``He was so empty.''
   About 60 young people have taken part in Levin's programs. He
lists his successes _ the students and the restaurants where they
work. His friends in the industry donate food, give lectures, even
invite students into their professional kitchens.
   ``No question about it. In time, these young people will have
their own businesses,'' said Levin, fairly bursting with pride.
   The culinary arts program is part of Phoenix Academy, a
residential high school Phoenix House runs with the Board of
Education.
   Students learn menu planning and writing, setting a formal
table, cooking, service. Once a week, they begin the day with a
lecture from Levin and end with the meal they prepared, usually for
12 to 15 people, including guests. After 10 weeks, there's a test
meal, and then Levin takes the class to lunch at a ``tablecloth
restaurant.''
   Students agree Levin is strict _ no eating while cooking, clean
as you go, follow directions, presentation counts as well as taste.
And they agree he teaches more than fine dining, things like
patience, consistency, respect.
   ``These kids are so stupendous,'' said Levin. ``They have a lust
for learning. They want to know, they want to learn, they want to
be. They're just like me.''
   That sameness is not always apparent.
   Gameal Abdo, for example, started using drugs at 13, went to six
junior high schools, eight boys' homes, even jail before he came to
Phoenix House in April 1986.
   Levin grew up in a nice part of Queens, served in the Korean War
and went to the University of Wyoming. He lives in a spacious
apartment overlooking Central Park. There are Picasso prints on his
walls and famous names in his telephone directory.
   But make no mistake: Abdo and Levin both touched bottom and
learned a new way to live.
   At 22, Abdo just landed a full-time job in Tony May's restaurant
as a prep cook, and he'll move to a transitional house while he
saves enough to rent his own apartment. He hopes to open his own
restaurant one day.
   And these days, Levin is on top of the world: ``I'm not a
president or a king, but I sure feel like one.''

<HEAD>Scientists Seek Physics Answers at Cornell Cold Spot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are no dangling icicles in Clark Hall,
no frost on the walls, and breathing doesn't produce vapor clouds.
But it's still one of the coldest known spots in the universe.
   ``It doesn't look very impressive but we are going to go a
million times colder than the coldest natural place we know of,''
says Robert C. Richardson, head of the low-temperature physics
group at Cornell University's Microkelvin Laboratory.
   Richardson and his colleagues, using a $1.5 million
super-refrigeration unit, will try to achieve absolute zero _ the
temperature at which even atoms stop rubbing together and creating
heat.
   ``We think we can take it down to between 1 and 10
microkelvin,'' he said. ``And each step of the way, we could be
finding new effects.''
   The only other U.S. deep-freeze laboratory is under construction
at the University of Florida. Labs in Japan and England have hit 12
microkelvin.
   How cold is that?
   That's 12 millionths of a degree above absolute zero, which is
zero on the Kelvin temperature scale, or minus 459 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   The researchers aren't simply out to break records, though.
   ``The importance of this type of research lies in realizing the
strange things that happen at low temperatures,'' said William
Oosterhuis, section head of the condensed matter sciences unit at
the National Science Foundation. ``One just never knows what's
going to happen. This research provides us with a probe into an
area where we've never been before.''
   Among the strange discoveries of extremely low-temperature
research has been superconductivity _ electricity with no loss to
resistance _ at 4 Kelvin.
   ``Sometimes it is the arithmetic or the theory behind the
research that has the practical application,'' said Donald H.
Liebenberg, who helped the lab get NSF funding before he left in
April for the Office of Naval Research.
   ``Sometimes the technology produced has broader applications in
other fields. The most important aspect, though, is that these
facilities will be breeding grounds of technological spinoffs for
future low temperature research,'' Liebenberg said.
   Individual scientists have conducted low temperature research
before, but the lack of a permanent facility to maintain such
temperatures indefinitely and allow for varied experiments has been
an obstacle, Richardson said. ``Now we have an adequate tool to
find _ or at least search properly _ for the answers to all the
open questions that remain in front of us.''
   The rooms adjoining Cornell's 2,800-square-foot underground
laboratory are designed to eliminate all stray heat, including that
produced from the most minute vibrations and from radio-frequency
electrical signals.
   To that end, they are lined with butcher block wood and
galvanized electromagnetic shielding and have specially grounded
electrical wiring and incandescent lighting. The low temperature
instruments are secured by concrete sewer pipes filled with sand.
   The supercooling machines themselves are rigid aluminum, filled
with liquid helium, copper and superconducting magnets. The
apparatus stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds, but the
focus is on a 36-inch vacuum cylinder.
   To reach microkelvin temperatures, a process that takes about
two weeks, scientists first polarize copper with a superconducting
magnet, then cool it to around 10 millikelvin in the refrigerator,
which uses liquid helium rather than freon gas for cooling. Once
the copper is at 10 millikelvin, the magnetic field is reduced and
the copper nuclei, which are now aligned and highly ordered, take
over, further cooling everything in the surrounding medium.
   ``We can never be sure what will be found,'' said Richardson.
``Maybe we'll have the good fortune to stumble upon a new science.''

its jitters on the eve of the debacle's one-year anniversary.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 19.38 points
Tuesday to 2,159.85. The blue-chip average brushed past the
previous post-crash high of 2,158.96 reached on Columbus Day, Oct.

   The optimism that swept over the oil futures
market in recent sessions disappeared as traders began to fear that
OPEC members might not be able to rein in their continuing
overproduction.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, plunged 60 cents Tuesday to close at $14.61 a 42-gallon
barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading. On Monday, the
November contract jumped 29 cents.
   Traders with large positions were unnerved by a report that
pegged current production by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries at 21 million to 22 million barrels a day, said
Richard Kane, a vice president with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Although the report contained no surprises, it was enough to
unsettle the oil market, which has been volatile in recent weeks
because of a series of upcoming OPEC meetings, Kane said.
   Last week traders bought heavily amid optimism that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries could agree to lower
production and stabilize prices. But Tuesday, ``people were wanting
to get flat'' before OPEC members met, Kane said.
   ``People like the market one day, they hate it the next day,''
he said.
   Over the weekend, oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council met and proposed a production ceiling of 18.5
million to 19 million barrels a day for the 13 OPEC nations.
   The GCC proposal is expected to be presented to OPEC's
committees on strategy and pricing, which are meeting in Madrid,
Spain, on Thursday. OPEC also has a ministerial conference
scheduled for Nov. 21.
   Refined products traded on the exchange were mostly lower
Tuesday. The November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose
0.16 cent to settle at 46.92 cents a gallon, but subsequent months
declined.
   The November contract for home heating oil fell 1.59 cents to
42.29 cents a gallon. Subsequent months also declined.

   Sayra Lebenthal remembers the 1929 stock market
crash almost as if it happened yesterday: Her baby nurse had the
day off so she had to put off selling bonds at the family
securities firm to take care of her two small children.
   Mrs. Lebenthal made it into work during last year's crash. Only
this time her son, James, was selling bonds beside her and
daughter, Eleanor, was home after just retiring from the family
business.
   On Monday, two days before the anniversary of the Oct. 19, 1987,
crash, Wall Street's grand dame celebrated her 90th birthday with
throngs of visiting clients, co-workers and friends.
   ``I'm not used to all this attention. I'm not used to these
flowers and plants. I'm just a hard-working lady who sells bonds
all day long,'' said Mrs. Lebenthal, who has served as treasurer of
municipal bond broker Lebenthal & Co. for the past 63 years.
   Her son, James, now runs the New York-based firm, but Mrs.
Lebenthal still keeps regular hours at the business that she and
her husband, Louis Lebenthal, started back in 1925 with just a few
dollars. The company has since grown into one of the largest
municipal bond dealers in the country.
   Municipal bonds, which are exempt from federal income taxes, are
debt securities issued by cities, counties or states to finance a
variety of projects.
   ``It took years and years to build up,'' Mrs. Lebenthal said in
a recent interview about her business. ``We started with an idea.
We had no money. We had second-hand furniture in a small office.
The only thing that was new was the secretary.''
   Mrs. Lebenthal learned the business on her own and from her
husband at a time when few women, especially those with young
children, were working on Wall Street. She held the company
together after a succession of strokes felled her husband in 1951,
passing along her knowledge to her two children.
   ``Mother was one smart cookie,'' said James Lebenthal, Lebenthal
& Co.'s chairman.
   ``There were very few women when I started here. (But) I
wouldn't play up the fact that I'm a woman,'' Mrs. Lebenthal said
in a stern voice.
   For Mrs. Lebenthal, a fiesty, well-dressed great-grandmother who
holds a law degree from the University of Syracuse, the day begins
shortly after sunrise.
   She sometimes makes a trip to the beauty parlor, then heads to
her Wall Street offices by 8:30 a.m., where she spends most of her
time on the telephone trying to match bonds with clients. Quitting
time is usually eight or nine hours later.
   ``I really cater to them,'' she said of the hundreds of clients
she has amassed over the years. ``There's a lot of sentiment
attached to the years I spent with my clients.
   ``I take from them man's greatest possession: money. If you make
money, you're doing good.''
   Mrs. Lebenthal does most of her work the old fashioned way _
without computers. Behind her desk and undernearth pictures of
assorted grandchildren and great-grandchildren are about three
dozen binders listing her clients in alphabetical order.
   ``I start with the A's on one day and the Z's the next.
Sometimes I miss the O's or P's,'' she said.
   Mrs. Lebenthal said that neither stock market crash particularly
fazed her, especially having lived through the Great Depression,
about a dozens recessions and New York City's fiscal crisis in the
mid-1970s.
   She said business picked up after both stock crashes as
investors looked to the bond market as a safer haven for their
money. She describes most of her clients as conservative investors
who don't know what to do with their money.
   ``The stock market isn't the be all to end all,'' she said. ``I
wasn't sitting here crying. My market became very strong.''
   Mrs. Lebenthal said her husband had predicted the 1929 stock
market crash and had even made bets with several colleagues.
   ``He had won a lot of bets. Did they make good on them? Not
one.''

   Cigarette profits are the driving power behind
Philip Morris Companies Inc., but the maker of Marlboro and
Virginia Slims sees cheese in its future.
   Philip Morris's $11 billion cash bid for Kraft Inc., which
formally began Tuesday, would give it control of a company that has
a 26 percent wedge of the U.S. market for natural cheese and 60
percent of the processed cheese market, according to market
researcher Find-SVP.
   Buying Kraft would make Philip Morris the undisputed king of the
supermarket aisles, with products ranging from Miller Lite and
Jell-O to such non-cheese Kraft brands as Miracle Whip, Sealtest
and Breyer's ice cream, Celestial Seasonings tea and Lender's
bagels.
   Even after swallowing Glenview, Ill.-based Kraft, though, New
York-based Philip Morris would lean heavily on cigarettes.
   Philip Morris currently gets 52 percent of its revenue and 77
percent of its operating profit from its tobacco business,
according to Mary English, an analyst for the Furman Selz
investment firm.
   Including Kraft, 40 percent of Philip Morris's revenue and 65
percent of operating income would come from tobacco, she said.
   Kraft's stock shot up $28.12{ a share to $88.25 on Tuesday, just
under the $90-a-share offer. But Philip Morris stock fell $4.50 a
share to $95.50, reflecting investors' worries that the expense of
the acquisition would hurt the company's profits. Trading was
extremely heavy in both stocks.
   Separately, a report published today said buyout specialist
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. is interested in Kraft and might be
posturing to rescue the company from Philip Morris.
   According to unidentified sources quoted in today's editions of
The New York Times, the buyout firm either has or is planning to
volunteer its services to Kraft management.
   The aggressive New York firm, with a $5.6 billion investment
pool that can leverage many times that amount, is financially
capable of competing against Philip Morris, the sources said.
   It is the immense profitability of cigarettes that gives Philip
Morris the muscle to bid for Kraft in a deal that would give the
company more control of supermarket shelf space and an entree to
the important European market.
   The purchase becomes especially important in light of the recent
$5.23 billion bid by Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC for Pillsbury
Co. Pillsbury's directors urged stockholders to reject the offer
Tuesday.
   In another deal, Holly Farms Inc. on Tuesday rejected an $891
million purchase offer from Tyson Foods Inc. that would have united
two of the nation's largest poultry processors.
   If successful, the bids would accelerate a trend in which the
food business is being concentrated in the hands of a few giant
multinational companies.
   Philip Morris contends the purchase of Kraft would not raise
antitrust concerns because Kraft and Philip Morris's General Foods
Corp. make different kinds of food.
   Analysts said the two companies combined would be able to make
more effective use of techniques such as cooperative advertising
with supermarkets in order to increase their all-important share of
shelf space.
   Kraft and General Foods also could share trucks, warehouses and
sales representatives. Meanwhile, Kraft's presence overseas could
help get General Foods brands distributed abroad.
   ``These American companies have got to get bigger and strong
before the other guys do, so they can compete head-to-head with the
European conglomerates,'' Miss English said.
   Contrary to the impression given by the backlash against smoking
in the United States, tobacco is not a dying industry. American
companies are selling cigarettes effectively abroad, and the global
industry is growing 1.5 percent to 2 percent a year, she said.
   But the impression that tobacco is a languishing market has kept
Philip Morris's stock lower than it otherwise might be, Hamish
Maxwell, Philip Morris's chairman and chief executive, said in an
interview Monday night.
   Philip Morris expects to generate $11 billion to $12 billion in
excess cash over the next five years, which would be used to pay
for the deal.
   In a sign of its financial strength, the company said Tuesday it
intended to pay for the deal up front by borrowing entirely from
commercial banks, rather than by selling debt securities to the
public.
   The excess cash is what Philip Morris will have left over after
taking care of dividend payouts and what it believes are its needs
for internal reinvestment. Philip Morris already has
state-of-the-art plants that churn out cigarettes far more cheaply
than they can be produced by low-cost labor in less developed
nations.
   In the past, the company's excess cash has gone into increased
dividends and share buybacks, which directly benefit shareholders,
but even after that there is money left over.

   Federal prosecutors officially notified Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. that it is targeted in a criminal grand jury
probe, raising the prospect that the investment giant will be
indicted.
   Drexel, which claims it is innocent of any wrongdoing, repeated
that assertion Tuesday in disclosing receipt of a so-called
``target letter'' from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.
   The disclosure came a month after Drexel, one of the biggest
Wall Street firms, was accused by the Securities and Exchange
Commission of extensive securities fraud in an alleged conspiracy
involving four key employees and now-imprisoned insider trader Ivan
F. Boesky.
   Although it has been widely known for months that a grand jury
has been probing Drexel's activities, formal notification often is
seen as a strong signal that prosecutors believe they have enough
evidence to bring charges.
   Bruce Baird, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of securities
fraud cases, was out of the office and unavailable for comment, an
aide said. Office spokeswoman Deborah Corley said she could not
comment.
   ``The U.S. attorney has advised Drexel Burnham by letter that it
is a target of a grand jury investigation looking into alleged
violations of the federal criminal laws,'' the firm said in a
statement.
   ``According to the staff of the U.S. attorney, no determination
has been made by the U.S. attorney to seek an indictment. Drexel
Burnham believes that any such indictment would be unwarranted and
unfair.''
   Drexel, a pioneer in the ``junk bond'' high-yield debt market,
has been under intense scrutiny by both the U.S. attorney's office
and the SEC because of disclosures by Boesky, who once had
extensive dealings with the firm and who settled insider trading
charges two years ago by paying a $100 million fine.
   In exchange for his cooperation in implicating others, Boesky
was allowed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge, conspiracy
to lie to the SEC.
   On Sept. 7 the SEC filed a long-awaited civil complaint alleging
Drexel, its high-yield bond financier Michael Milken and others
schemed with Boesky to profit on inside information, cheat Drexel
clients, hide stock in each other's names to avoid reporting
requirements and commit other frauds.
   Drexel, Milken and the other defendants denied those
accusations. If a grand jury were to indict them, the SEC suit
likely would be delayed by the more serious criminal charges.
   The SEC suit already has been delayed by pretrial haggling over
evidence gathering and the impartiality of the federal judge
presiding over the case, Milton Pollack.
   On Monday, Pollack rejected defense attorney requests that he
disqualify himself, calling their arguments unfounded. The defense
has vowed to appeal his ruling.

what to give the person who can afford anything: diamonds, furs and
crystal.
   Starting at the top of the Robb Report, a monthly publication
for the excessively rich, is the Let Them Eat Cake Department. That
grandiose gift entails a $20 million slice of ersatz cake made of
2,500 diamonds by jeweler Harry Winston, who created the inedible
confection for the 75th anniversary of Beverly Hills.
   Also for jewelry lovers is a $1 million, low-cut bustier
encrusted with 2,100 white, yellow and pink diamonds hand-sewn into
elastic silk _ an 825-carat top.
   Then there is a full-length mink bathrobe, belt and pockets
included, for $25,000. The least expensive extravagance is for
golfers: a $195 putter made of lead crystal.
   Founded in 1976, the Acton-based publication is a lifestyle
magazine for a readership that associate publisher John Treworgy
described as largely entrepreneurial and 90 percent male. The
average reader makes $420,000 and has a net worth of $2.6 million.
   The Robb Report list of gifts is not a catalog; the magazine
tells readers where the items can be purchased. The list of 27 gift
ideas was culled by a committee from hundreds of suggestions
collected over the year.
   The criteria was simple, Treworgy said: ``We were looking for
unique and outrageous kinds of gifts ... and money is no object.''

   Pillsbury Co.'s Doughboy isn't being shy
about the company's rejection of a $5.23 billion unsolicited
takeover by Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   A day after Pillsbury urged shareholders to turn down Grand
Met's $60-a-share tender offer, a snarling Doughboy sporting boxing
gloves and rolled-up sleeves appeared today in full-page newspaper
ads designed to convince shareholders the company is serious about
remaining independent.
   In selected newspapers around the country, Pillsbury's
once-jovial mascot appeared under the headline: ``Grand Met must
have had one too many if they thought we wouldn't put up a fight.''
   Pillsbury said it is ``not going to sit idly by while an
opportunistic British liquor and gambling company takes advantage
of a weak U.S. dollar and tries to buy respectability with the
purchase of a classic American company.''
   On Tuesday, Grand Met continued to press for a friendly deal,
but Pillsbury Chairman Philip L. Smith stressed that now is not the
time to sell. ``Greater values are available to the shareholders in
the long term.''
   The options could include a special dividend to shareholders,
the selling of some of the company's businesses in a financial
restructuring, a leveraged buyout, or ``the sale of an equity
interest to a third party,'' Smith said.
   ``There are options that include not putting the company up for
sale,'' Smith said.
   He said the company's directors will decide on an alternative
before shareholders are required to decide whether to tender their
shares. Grand Met's offer expires Nov. 1, but could be extended.
   Ian A. Martin, chief executive of U.S. operations for Grand Met,
said he was surprised Pillsbury's board concluded the all-cash
offer was inadequate.
   ``Our price represents more than 50 percent over the Pillsbury
market price prior to the announcement of our offer,'' Martin said.
``We doubt that Pillsbury stockholders will agree with their
board's conclusion.''
   Pillsbury's stock rose 37{ cents a share to $59 a share in
consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.
   Grand Met spokesman Walter Montgomery said Smith was vague in
explaining why Pillsbury shareholders should hold on to their stock.
   ``The company's eagerly awaited but unsatisfactory response to
this generous offer exhibits the same indecisiveness that has
prevented Pillsbury from taking advantage of its many previous
oportunities to produce value for its shareholders,'' Montgomery
said.
   Asked what direction the board was leaning in chosing an
alternative to accepting the offer, Smith said, ``There really
isn't at this particular time any real favorite.''
   Smith said the Pillsbury board rejected the offer after deciding
that significant investments have been made to improve slumping
Burger King operations and the full-service restaurant chain of
Steak & Ale.
   Grand Met has said it would sell Pillsbury's full-service
restaurants to comply with laws that forbid liquor distillers from
selling liquor at retail outlets, but it has said it would retain
Burger King and other core businesses. The British company also has
said it would cut some senior management jobs at Pillsbury if the
bid is successful.
   Pillsbury is suing Grand Met in 14 states on grounds that the
takeover would violate the so-called ``tied-house'' liquor
statutes. Additional legal action was taken Tuesday with a lawsuit
filed in Washington D.C., alleging that Grand Met's tender offer
violates a section of the 1916 Shipping Act.
   According to the suit, it would be illegal for Pillsbury to
transfer ownership of its TPC Transportation Co. to Grand Met
because it is a foreign company. Such a transfer requires the
approval of the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, according to the
lawsuit. TPC is a water carrier operating towboats and barges,
Pillsbury said.
   Montgomery said Grand Met lawyers have said the proposed
takeover would not violate the Shipping Act.

<TEXT>
   Annual Top Performance awards of the Associated
Press Managing Editors association have been presented to the AP
Business News department, the AP Mountain States regional reporter,
Tad Bartimus, and AP photographers Max Nash of Tel Aviv, Israel,
and Jeff Widener of Bangkok, Thailand.
   APME also has awarded special citations to Fred Bayles, AP
national writer, and Scott McCartney, AP Southwest regional
reporter.
   The organization named newsman Ron Blum of the AP Sports
Department winner of its eighth annual John L. Dougherty award.
   The Top Performance awards, presented Tuesday, are given

photographers during the previous year. There are two categories:
performing under deadline pressure, and feature writing or feature
photography.
   The winners, as well as Bayles and McCartney, were awarded
$1,500 and a plaque at the APME convention here.
   The John L. Dougherty award recognizes excellence in the work of
a young AP writer. Dougherty, a former APME leader and managing
editor of the Rochester, N.Y., newspapers, had an abiding interest
in helping young writers improve their skills. Dougherty died in
1980. Blum received a $1,000 cash award and a plaque.
   The AP Business News department was honored for its wide-ranging
and in-depth coverage of the October 1987 stock market crash, and
Bartimus for her moving article on the accidental drowning of three
young brothers.
   Nash was selected for his spot photo coverage of Israel's
troubled occupied territories, and Widener for a series of feature
photos of Afghan refugees.
   Bayles and McCartney were awarded the special citation for their
six-part series, ``Guardianship of the Elderly.''
   Awards for excellence in the Top Performance reporting-writing
competition went to the AP staff in Israel for its coverage of the
West Bank rebellion; Joan Mower and Michael Sniffen of AP's
Washington bureau for stories reporting possibly unethical
activities by former Attorney General Edwin Meese; Nancy Shulins,
AP Newsfeatures, for her two-part series on people who have
undergone operations removing one side of their brains, and Sharon
Cohen, Midwest regional reporter, for her series on workers
displaced by the industrial slump in the Rust Belt.
   Awards for excellence in photography were given to Martin
Cleaver of London for photos of clashes between Palestinians and
Israeli soldiers; Al Behrman of Cincinnati for photographs of track
stars Valerie Brisco and Florence Griffith-Joyner in action; John
Gapps III of Des Moines, Iowa, for his picture of a farmer in his
drought-parched field; Scott Applewhite of Washington for a photo
of Vice President George Bush with his granddaughter, and Liu Heung
Shing of New Delhi for a picture of a weeping exiled Tibetan woman.

   Poultry processing giant Tyson Foods Inc.
expressed disappointment that its $900 million buyout offer for
Holly Farms Corp. was rejected as inadequate.
   But officials at Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson had no comment
Tuesday on whether they might sweeten their bid for the rival
poultry company.
   Tyson Foods, the nation's largest poultry processor, offered $45
a share plus a quarter share of Tyson Class A stock for each of
Holly Farms' 18.1 million outstanding shares.
   Bob Justice, a spokesman for Tyson Foods, declined to comment on
whether his company plans to pursue its takeover bid.
   ``We're very disappointed that they did not sit down and talk
with us about the matter. At this time, we have no further comment
to make,'' Justice said.
   In a statement, Holly Farms said its board of directors voted
unanimously to reject Tyson's offer, which was made last week.
   ``We just decided that the offer is inadequate and not in the
best long-term interest of the shareholders,'' said Ted Bailey, a
Holly Farms vice president.
   He refused to comment on whether Holly Farms would consider a
higher proposal from Tyson.
   ``Our company achieved record results in the first quarter, and
we have told our shareholders that the prospects are excellent for
all of our businesses for the remainder of the year,'' Holly Farms
President R. Lee Taylor said in the statement.
   ``For over 20 years Holly Farms shareholders have experienced
superior long-term investment returns,'' he noted.
   Holly Farms stock fell 75 cents a share to 50.12{ Tuesday in
consolidated trading on the New York Sock Exchange.
   Holly Farms is a diversified foods company with about 50 percent
of its sales in chicken. The company had sales of $1.6 billion last
year and net income of $36.2 million, or $2.06 a share.
   Tyson Foods produces 14 million pounds of chicken meat a week.
The company had sales in 1987 totaling $1.8 billion and a net
income of $67 million. The company's operations include hatcheries,
feed mills, processing plants and a marketing branch.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Miguel de la Madrid boasted of his
government's efforts to reduce its role in the economy and declared
that the era of state economic interventionism was over in Mexico.
   Meanwhile, new government figures released Tuesday confirmed a
dramatic shrinkage in Mexico's trade surplus, with oil revenues
sinking and imports skyrocketing by more than 50 percent above
their 1987 level.
   De la Madrid, whose six-year term ends Nov. 30, cited reductions
in government spending, a tighter rein on public accounts and the
liquidation of unprofitable state-run enterprises under his tenure
in a meeting with Commerce Department officials on Tuesday.
   ``Without bragging, I can affirm that there is no other
government in the world that has accomplished a rationalization of
its administrative apparatus with the rapidity that we Mexicans
have,'' he said.
   De la Madrid ordered more than $250 million in budget cuts this
month after prices for oil, a staple Mexican export, dropped to
record lows.
   The cuts were linked to an agreement with the U.S. Treasury
Department and Federal Reserve that permits Mexico to draw up to
$3.5 billion in bridge loans until the government reaches new loan
agreements with the World Bank and possibly other multilateral
agencies.
   A World Bank mission is visiting Mexico City to discuss with
Mexican officials possible arrangements for new long-term financing.
   In announcing the loan package on Monday, the Treasury
Department said it was intended to support Mexico's budget-cutting
and anti-inflation programs by cushioning the impact of the oil
price plunge, which will cost Mexico billions of dollars in
anticipated revenues this year.
   De la Madrid also cited Mexico's accession in 1986 to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under which the government
has dismantled a decades-old import substitution policy and opened
up the economy to foreign imports.
   ``Mexico now has a full role in large-scale trade negotiations
that are taking place in the world. Had we stayed at the margin of
a badly understood nationalism, the country today would have been
gravely damaged,'' the president said.
   Mexico's trade surplus for the first eight months of the year
slipped to $2.5 billion, well below the $6 billion surplus
registered between January and August of 1987, the government-run
National Statistics Institute reported Tuesday.
   Exports reached $14.2 billion during the January-August period,
with non-oil goods, at $9.4 billion, well outpacing petroleum
exports, at $4.7 billion. In 1987, crude oil and petroleum-derived
exports totalled $5.8 billion.
   Oil accounted for 29.6 percent of total export revenues in 1988,
compared to 39.3 percent for the eight-month period in 1987.
   Imports between January and August surged to $11.7 billion, or
53 percent more than last year's $7.6 billion figure, the institute
said.
   Capital goods imports worth $8.2 billion accounted for the bulk
of the increase, rising 57 percent over the same eight-month period
in 1987. The institute attributed the rise to greater demand for
manufactures inputs by a healthier industrial sector.
   The institute said imports of consumer goods jumped by 133.4
percent, to just over $1 billion.
   De la Madrid's administration paved the way for the import surge
by reducing tariffs, abolishing official prices for imports and
eliminating a prior import permit requirement for most products.
   The maximum import tariff, which once stood at 40 percent, now
is 20 percent. Most tariffs currently in effect are below that
figure.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Pillsbury May Sell Burger King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. may be forced to sell its Burger King
fast-food chain to fend off an unwanted $5.23 billion takeover bid
from the British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC., analysts say.
   Pillsbury's board unanimously rejected Grand Met's $60-a-share
offer Tuesday, calling it ``inadequate and not in the best
interests of the company and its shareholders.''
   Minneapolis-based Pillsbury said it would consider other
alternatives, including selling the company to a third party,
restructuring Pillsbury's finances by selling some businesses.
   Speculation of an possible Burger King sale was fueled Tuesday
by the resignation of Burger King President Charles S. Olcutt.
Appointed Burger King chairman was Jerry W. Levin, a Pillsbury
executive vice president known for his work on mergers and
acquisitions.
   ``The guy's good at doing deals,'' John McMillin, an analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York said of Levin.
``I've got to think he's been brought in to do a deal.''
   Analysts speculated that the sale of the Miami-based restaurant
chain could bring Pillsbury as much as $2 billion.
   Burger King accounts for about one-third of Pillsbury's sales
and about two-thirds of its profits but has not done well recently.
The company reported its pre-tax profits have declined more than 50
percent, to $48.2 million in the fiscal year ended May 31 from
$119.2 million in fiscal 1986.
   William Maguire, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New
York, said Olcott, who quit after just over two years in the post,
``wasn't a marketing man when they needed a marketing man badly.''
   During Olcott's administration, the company ran an expensive but
disappointing advertising campaign touting its hamburgers based on
the slogan: ``We do it like you'd do it.''

<HEAD>Nation's Industrial Sector On The Road To Recovery</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: leads with 7 grafs with Commerce Department report on
September housing starts, picks up 3rd graf, Separately, the.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction rebounded in September as a sharp rise in
apartment construction offset a drop in single-family home
building, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.45 million units last
month, up 22,000 units, or 1.5 percent, from August, when housing
starts fell a sharp 3.1 percent.
   Analysts had been expecting a modest recovery in housing starts
for last month because fixed-rate mortgages retreated a bit after
rising steadily from late March through mid-August, when they
peaked for the year so far at 10.71 percent.
   Last week, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Co.,
rates averaged 10.33 percent, the lowest since early May.
   Building permits, a good indicator of future housing activity,
fell 4.4 percent in September to an annual rate of 1.40 million
units, after rising 3.1 percent in August.
   On Tuesday, two reports indicated the nation's industrial sector
is on the road to recovery, while the stock market rose to a
post-crash high on the eve of the first anniversary of Black Monday.
   Speculation in takeover issues pushed the Dow Jones average of
30 industrials up 19.38 points to 2,159.85, its highest point since
the Oct. 19 market crash last year.
   Separately, the Federal Reserve reported that a surge in exports
is responsible for boom times at the nation's factories.
   In a review of the economy based on reports from its 12 regional
banks, the Fed said all areas of the nation's industrial sector
show signs of strength and expansion _ including chemicals, paper
and pulp, steel, autos and trucks and machinery.
   Economists noted the drop in the value of the dollar over the
last three years has made U.S. goods less expensive on overseas
markets and has fueled a boom in export sales this year.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said that income
growth in the ``Rust Belt'' is staging a comeback after trailing
the national average for most of the decade.
   In its report on non-farm personal income, the Commerce
Department said that states bordering the Pacific and Atlantic
coasts continue to have generally better income growth than the
states in between, but the gap in the growth rates is narrowing.
   The government attributed gains in the Great Lakes states to
strength in the manufacturing of durable goods, ``big ticket''
items expected to last three or more years, and in construction. It
said the Mid-Atlantic region also benefited from a pickup in
manufacturing.
   The latest government reports supported bond prices, driving
interest rates lower. In foreign-exchange trading, the dollar rose
against most major currencies. Oil futures prices fell.

<HEAD>EEC Raises Economic Growth Forecast For 1988, 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
predicted Wednesday the economy of the 12-nation trading bloc will
grow by an average 3.5 percent this year and by 2.75 percent in
1989.
   The figures are up sharply from the EEC's July 1, which
predicted growth of 2.75 and 2.25 percent respectively.
   ``The forecasts this year are indeed very positive,'' the EEC
Commission said in a report to the 12 EEC states.
   ``The economic prospects for the Community have significantly
improved in recent months'' and 1988 and 1989 should see the
strongest economic growth ``since the end of the 1970s,'' the
report said.
   The EEC report predicted 4 percent growth in the United States
in 1988 and 2.25 percent in 1989, and 5.5 percent and 3.75 percent
growth in Japan.
   The EEC economy grew by 2.9 percent last year, 2.6 percent in
1986 and 2.5 percent in 1985.
   The EEC Commission said investments in the EEC will rise by 7
percent in 1988 _ the highest rate in 20 years and up from July's
forecast of 4.8 percent _ and the EEC's average inflation rate of 3
percent will match that of the economic boom years of 1960s.
   ``The success in fighting inflation and the convergence of
inflationary performances in the (12 EEC) member countries are
impressive,'' the Commision said. ``Exactly one year after the
stock market crash, the Community is in an advantageous position
from which to tackle the economic problems of the coming years.''
   It credited the rosy outlook to healthy growth rates forecast
notably for Spain, Portugal, Italy and Britain.

   Stock prices edged upward today in a mood of
caution as Wall Street marked the first anniversary of the crash of
1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.60 to 2,161.45 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 510 up, 422 down and
512 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.18 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Trading activity, which has been sluggish for the past several
months, got a boost on Tuesday following word of Philip Morris's
$11.4 billion takeover bid for Kraft Inc.
   That triggered buying interest in other food stocks, and blue
chips as well.
   But analysts said the memory of the market's record drop a year
ago still was acting as a damper on traders' enthusiasm.
   In addition, some investors seemed to be leery of making big
commitments before the government's scheduled report Friday on the
consumer price index for September.
   Philip Morris shares dropped | to 94~ in early activity today.
Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up [ at
44}; Alcoa, up { at 55|, and International Business Machines, up [
at 124{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.16 to 157.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .52 at 304.67.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 19.38 points
to 2,159.85, its highest close since last October's crash.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 841 up, 568 down and 546 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 162.5 million shares, up from 119.29
million in Monday's session.

<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Chemical Co. said its third-quarter
profit soared 92 percent over last year due to strong sales of
chemicals and consumer and industrial products.
   Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 was a record $632
million, or $3.36 a share, compared with earnings of $330 million,
or $1.72 a share, in 1987. Sales were $4.15 billion, up 24 percent
from $3.36 billion in the year-earlier period.
   For the first nine months of the year, Dow's profit totaled $1.7
billion, or $9.32 a share, on sales of $12.38 billion. A year ago
it netted $891 million, or $4.64 a share, on sales of $9.78 billion.
   ``All business segments in all geographic areas had strong
performances in what has typically been an off-season quarter,''
said Enrique C. Falla, Dow's financial vice president.
   Dow said its sales were up 26 percent in the United States, 14
percent in Europe and 31 percent in the rest of the world, with
major gains in Canada and the Pacific.
   Caustic soda and ethylene glycol were top contributors to strong
volume increases in the basic chemicals segment, the company said.
   DowBrands' plastic food wrap business and sales of Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s probucol cholesterol reducing agent were top
selling consumer specialties, it said.
   The company said strong sales in polycarbonate polymer as result
of expanded production in Texas aided growth in industrial
specialties. Polycarbonate polymer is a strong, plastic-like
substance used in the auto, appliance and other industries.

   Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. on
Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in its third-quarter
profit on strong sales.
   3M said that for the three months ended Sept. 30 earnings rose
to $296 million, or $1.30 a share, from $249 million, or $1.09 a
share, in 1987. Sales totaled $2.69 billion, vs. $2.47 billion a
year ago.
   For the first nine months, 3M's profit was $882 million, or
$3.88 a share, on sales of $8 billion. A year ago it earned $702
million, or $3.07 a share, and had sales of $7.05 billion.
   3M Chairman Allen F. Jacobson said sales were strong, especially
overseas, due to the weaker dollar.
   ``Our international unit volume rose about 12 percent for the
quarter, as we continued to benefit from efforts to increase
penetration of international markets,'' he said. ``These volume
gains helped our international companies surpass $1 billion in
sales for the third consecutive quarter.''
   Jacobson said the company also benefited from changes in the tax
law.

<HEAD>DOT Says It Will Reconsider Awarding Of United Route To
Continental</HEAD>

   The Department of Transportation will
reconsider its award to Continental Airlines of the Seattle-Tokyo
air route once given to rival United Airlines.
   The announcement Tuesday postponed for another month a decision
in a two-year battle over a route worth more than $100 million in
revenue annually.
   Both United and American Airlines had asked for the review,
claiming they were more qualified and competent to fly the route
than Continental.
   ``Although this does not represent a final decision, we are
confident that the clear merits of our case will speak for
themselves in an objective review by the department,'' said Chuck
Novak, a spokesman for Chicago-based United.
   In a five-page order, the department said that despite a federal
appeals decision ordering that Houston-based Continental be awarded
the route, it had decided to take another look at the case.
   ``The department clearly has the authority to reconsider its own
decision,'' the order said. ``Reconsideration of a final agency
decision is inherent in the agency's power to decide.''
   The order said that United and American had raised questions as
to whether an administrative law judge in initially awarding the
route to Continental had failed to properly consider the
department's ``criteria'' for selecting a carrier for the route.
   ``We agree with this argument,'' the order said.
   The administrative law judge's decision was the basis for the
appeals court decision ordering the department to give the route to
Continental.
   The review will be conducted by a senior department official and
a decision is due no later than Nov. 21. The department refused to
reopen the hearing record.
   Tuesday's decision was the latest twist in the hotly-contested
fight over the route, which at various times has been awarded to
all three airlines by different administrative law judges and
department officials.
   ``It's absolutely good news,'' Steve McGregor, an American
spokesman in Dallas, said of the department's decision to
reconsider. ``The appeals court decision was based on procedural
grounds and we would hate to see such an important route be awarded
on such a basis.''
   The Seattle-Tokyo route had previously been flown by Pan
American World Airways, but United assumed the route temporarily
when it purchased Pan Am Corp.'s Pacific Division in 1986.
   The department approved the purchase but only on the condition
that the Seattle-Tokyo route be dealt with separately.
   United has warned that it would be forced to cancel its
Seattle-Hong Kong route and lay off many of its 2,500 workers at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport unless it was allowed to
continue flying the Tokyo route.
   A $20 million expansion of United facilities at the airport was
put on hold pending a decision.
   American Airlines officials have said their airline was prepared
to build a new $100 million to $150 million hub at the
Seattle-Tacoma airport if it received the route.

   Stock prices advanced slightly today in a mood
of caution as Wall Street marked the first anniversary of the crash
of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which closed Tuesday at
its highest level since the collapse a year ago, rose 2.31 to
2,162.16 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 696 up, 500 down and
536 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.71 million shares at
midmorning.
   Trading activity, which has been sluggish for the past several
months, got a boost on Tuesday following word of Philip Morris's
$11.4 billion takeover bid for Kraft Inc.
   That triggered buying interest in other food stocks, and blue
chips as well.
   But analysts said the memory of the market's record drop a year
ago still was acting as a damper on traders' enthusiasm.
   In addition, some investors seemed to be leery of making big
commitments before the government's scheduled report Friday on the
consumer price index for September.
   Kraft climbed 3[ to 91] and Philip Morris shares dropped ] to
95[ in early activity today. Gainers among the blue chips included
General Electric, up \ at 44~ and Eastman Kodak, up [ at 48}.
   Apple Computer rose 1[ to 40{ in the over-the-counter market.
The company reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ended
Sept. 30 of 84 cents a share, up from 54 cents in the comparable
period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .33 to 157.65. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.17 at 305.32.

<HEAD>Robins Posts Earnings Decline of 12 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A.H. Robins Co. said Wednesday that
expenses associated with its Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan and its
merger with American Home Products Corp. contributed to a 12
percent decline in third-quarter earnings.
   Robins said earnings for the three-month period that ended Sept.
30 were $23.4 million, or 97 cents a share, down from $26.6
million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier.
   Excluding the bankruptcy and merger expenses, net earnings would
have increased 63 percent to $43.4 million, the pharmaceutical
company said.
   Sales for the third quarter were $264.1 million, a 15 percent
increase over the $229 million for the corresponding period in
1987. Operating earnings were $63.1 million, up 25 percent from
$50.6 million a year earlier.
   Net earnings for the first nine months of this year were $45.5
million, or $1.88 a share, down 25 percent from $60.3 million, or
$2.50 a share, for the same period in 1987. Operating earnings for
the first three quarters increased 11 percent from $122.8 million
last year to $136 million in 1988.
   Nine-month sales rose 12 percent to $692.8 million from $621
million last year.
   Robins filed for protection under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy laws in August 1985 in the wake of mounting claims from
women who alleged they had been injured by the company's Dalkon
Shield birth control device. Among the company's other products are
Robitussin cough medicine and Dimetapp cold remedy.
   Robins' merger with American Home Products Corp. of New York is
part of the company's Chapter 11 reorganization plan.

   Twelve members of Congress today asked
President Reagan not to permit production of nuclear weapons
material to resume without a certification to Congress that it can
be done safely.
   ``We're trying to change the debate of the past two weeks,'' to
``get away from finger-pointing'' and address institutional and
policy problems, said one of the organizers of the letter, Rep.
Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the environment subcommittee of
the House Goverment Operations Committee.
   ``The Energy Department is not in control of its own plants; it
is the captive of its contractors,'' was how Synar decribed the
chief problem.
   The letter was released shortly after Energy Secretary John
Herrington told television interviewers that safety standards at
the nation's aging nuclear weapons plants have been adequate but
are not acceptable under modern standards.
   Herrington, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, said the
Energy Department has doubled its cleanup budget to $1.5 billion a
year and plans further increases.
   He said in another interview, on ``CBS This Morning,'' that
cleaning up will cost $100 billion to $150 billion, which is close
to the estimate of a congressional study released earlier this
month. The General Accounting Office, according to Synar, has put
the cost at $150 billiont to $175 billion over the next 20 to 30
years.
   The department has shut down all of its facilities producing
plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons because of safety
problems. Herrington announced last week that one of three
tritium-producing reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken,
S.C., would be restarted by January.
   Three environmental groups, however, threatened today to seek a
court injunction to stop the reopening unless Herrington prepares
an environmental impact statement first. Those statements can take
a year or two to prepare.
   The letter to Reagan asked that he require the department to
develop, within 90 days, a plan ``which will put the department
back in control of its facilities, establish clear lines of
authority and communication, and firmly identify who is
responsible.''
   It also asked that no reactor be restarted until the
department's new Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety
certifies to both Congress and the department ``that public health
and safety will be adequately protected during reactor operations.''
   Synar said the group had no objection to contractors operating
government weapons plants as long as they were properly supervised.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a long-time critic of the deparment's
operations and a signer of the letter, said he thought a restart
could be accomplished ``reasonably soon,'' but not within 90 days.
   Spokesmen at the Energy Department who could comment on the
letter were not available.
   In addition to Synar and Glenn, the letter was signed by House
Democratic Committee Chairmen Jack Brooks of Texas, Government
Operations; Mo Udall of Arizona, Interior; John Dingell of
Michigan, Energy and Commerce; and House Democrats Phil Sharp of
Indiana, Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma; David E. Skaggs of Colorado,
Albert Bustamente of Texas and Norman Dicks of Washington, and
Republicans Frank Horton of New York and William F. Clinger of
Pennsylvania.
   The department stopped the only operating reactor at Savannah
River in Augst after the plant operator, Du Pont Co., ignored an
unexplained power surge during startup.
   The government also has closed its Rocky Flats plutonium
production plant at Golden, Colo., after three workers were exposed
to radiation last month. Herrington said there is no shortage of
plutonium but tritium deteriorates and supplies need to be replaced.
   The plants were built in the 1950s, and energy officials have
said they will have to be used for another decade, even though the
normal life of a nuclear plant is 25 years.
   ``There has been a good margin of safety. It's been adequate,''
Herrington told CBS. But he said it was not acceptable under
standards for the future.
   He noted that no one had been killed or hurt as a result of 30
major mishaps reported at the Savannah River Plant or incidents at
other weapons facilities.
   ``But I think that margin of safety has to be widened, and
that's what you're seeing today,'' Herrington said.
   He said none of the problems at the Savannah River plant
approached a meltdown, which could have endangered the public and
no commercial power plant has been affected by the safety problems.
   Herrington said in the NBC interview that the department plans
to release a report ranking nuclear production sites and saying
what is wrong with each one and what needs to be done to clean up
and modernize.
   ``It's the right way to do business today, and we are turning
this giant industrial complex in a good way in my estimation,'' he
said.

   Ford Motor Co. announced Wednesday that
it will spend $200 million for a modernized paint shop at its light
truck assembly plant outside Kansas City, Mo.
   The company will add 330,000 square feet to the plant in
Claycomo north of Kansas City. The expansion will include a new
enamel paint system and will extend the current corrosion
protection system.
   The plant builds Ford's F-series pickup line and the Ford Tempo
and Mercury Topaz automobiles. The plant employs about 4,300 people
and the expansion will not change that.
   Work at the new paint shop will begin in late 1990. Until then,
the current paint facility will be used, Ford spokesman Bert Serre
said.

   Airline executives who've faced him across a
bargaining table and union militants who've stood with him in
picket lines use the same word to describe Teamsters leader William
F. Genoese: feisty.
   Some call him downright ornery. Not a few detractors portray him
as a fire-breathing dragon who is big on threats but short on
delivering tangible benefits to his rank and file.
   Genoese, 62, the director of the Teamsters union's Airline
Division, is an old-style labor leader and a perpetual thorn in the
side of big carriers like Pan Am Corp.
   Shy and retiring he's not. ``I'm known to be able to steal the
socks off your feet with your shoes still on `em,'' Genoese said in
a recent interview, vaunting his reputed prowess in negotiating
with company officials.
   ``We call him the magician,'' said Joe Konowe, director of the
union's industrial trades division, who was an assistant to former
Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa in the 1950s and `60s.
   Genoese represents around 40,000 Teamsters union employees at
several major airlines: notably Pan Am, Northwest Airlines, USAir
Group Inc. and Braniff Inc. (Not all big airlines have a Teamsters
local.) The union also recently won representation at privately
owned United Parcel Service, which operates a fleet of around 250
planes as part of its delivery network.
   The airline Teamsters include passenger service, cargo and
reservations agents, baggage handlers, clerical workers and nurses.
Unlike pilots and flight engineers, they can be fairly easily
replaced by airlines in labor disputes _ but they can disrupt a
carrier's operations if they strike.
   Together, Teamsters employees at the airlines provide Genoese
with a war chest of around $300,000 a year in union dues.
   Genoese's biggest battle is at Pan Am. The beleaguered airline,
which lost $88.4 million in the first half of this year, imposed
$35 million in pay cuts on its 4,200 Teamsters under federal labor
rules after they rejected a new cost-cutting contract last February.
   Genoese has threatened to call the Teamsters out on strike
against Pan Am under the same rules, but so far hasn't done so.
When the union's strike deadline passed in February, he vowed
``guerrilla warfare'' against Pan Am _ including deliberate
diversion of baggage and cargo and cancellation of passengers'
reservations.
   It's that kind of behavior that has sparked tough criticism of
the Teamsters leader.
   ``I don't like the way Genoese is playing,'' said a Pan Am union
member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The tactics that
Genoese is using now are the tactics of the past.''
   Genoese doesn't see it that way. ``Any company of any size can
beat any union unless the union is on top of it and knows how to
muster its strength,'' he said in the interview in his Manhattan
office.
   A visit to the sprawling union office, with its staff of 25
(including Genoese's son Bill Jr.), is a walk down the memory lane
of the U.S. labor movement. The walls of the conference room are
lined with poster-size photographs of union leaders exhorting
crowds of rank-and-file members, and of World Airways stewardesses
stripping off their clothes on a picket line in the 1960s in a
contract dispute.
   ``I've been out on the ground,'' Genoese said, looking back on
his early days as a general organizer around the country for the
Teamsters.
   In the 1950s, as an engineer and union activist at the phone
company in New York, Genoese was galvanized by labor titans like
Hoffa and former United Auto Workers chief Walter Reuther. It was
the flamboyant Hoffa who tapped Genoese to join the Teamsters as an
organizer.
   Genoese, a slight man with penetrating blue eyes, grew up in the
tough Navy Yard section of Brooklyn, N.Y. ``Our neighborhood was so
poor they ripped it down to put a slum up,'' he reminisced in his
pungent Brooklyn accent. After serving in the Navy, he got an
engineering degree from Pratt Institute in New York and went to
work as a phone company engineer before joining the Teamsters in
1961.
   Genoese has long advocated selling Pan Am to cure its financial
ills and has allied himself with several suitors, most recently
Towers Financial Corp. Towers, a debt-collection and insurance
holding company based in New York, has said it intends to launch a
takeover bid for Pan Am with the Teamsters' backing.
   But Towers' overture, already viewed with skepticism by Wall
Street analysts, probably lost more credibility in August, when the
Securities and Exchange Commission charged Towers with selling $20
million in unregistered securities to finance a debt-collection
program.
   Towers Chairman Steven Hoffenberg admitted recently that it
would be extremely difficult to acquire Pan Am at this point
without the cooperation of the airline's management.
   In addition to his continuing relationship with Towers, Genoese
also persuaded a coalition of Pan Am unions to hire the powerhouse
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to explore a possible
buyout.
   His ability to wire these networks across the traditional
boundaries of the haves and have-nots, mixing old-style labor
politics with new-style wheeling and dealing on Wall Street, is
what helps Genoese keep management off balance, observers say.
   ``People on Wall Street know the Teamsters have money behind
them; they understand economics,'' Genoese asserted. ``It opens any
door.''

<HEAD>Stores Optimistic About Christmas Despite Sluggish Sales</HEAD>

   In the coming weeks, as stores and shopping
malls fill with people buying Christmas gifts, it might look like
any other holiday season.
   But the bustle will mask the fact that cautious consumer
spending has forced retailers to take a subdued approach to this
Christmas and their prospects for meaningful sales growth in the
foreseeable future.
   Nonetheless, stores are expected to have a profitable season.
   ``Last year, I played Ebenezer Scrooge,'' said Robert Buchanan,
an analyst with the investment firm A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ``This year I'm a little more upbeat _ especially with
respect to earnings _ because of the constructive steps the
retailers have taken in recognition of slower sales.''
   Said Michael Wellman, vice president for marketing at K mart
Corp., ``Christmas is going to be very competitive, but no reason
to be gnashing one's teeth over the consumer who doesn't seem to
have much enthusiasm.''
   Estimates of sales growth this season range from 4 percent to 6
percent over Christmas 1987 levels, or about the pace of inflation
so far this year. That's what economist David Wyss calls ``a
mediocre Christmas, not a terrible one.''
   ``People are a little bit nervous about the economy,'' said
Wyss, of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass.-based economic
forecasting service.
   ``It's been a year since the (stock market) crash, but I don't
think the crash has entirely left their minds,'' he said.
   Higher interest rates, relatively weak growth in income and a
low savings rate are also contributing to consumers' uneasiness,
Wyss said.
   These factors have been cited consistently over the past year
and a half as reasons for the slowdown in sales that forced
retailers to take steep markdowns and eroded their profits. Several
of the nation's biggest storeowners have posted sales increases of
3 percent or less so far in 1988 _ which means they've been losing
ground to inflation.
   To make matters worse, Christmas 1987 was a dismal time for
retailers, and it led to low-key sales forecasts for this holiday
season.
   Buchanan predicted sales in the next two months will be fair to
poor. He said he's seen growth in Americans' disposable income, but
``Consumers are so strapped by debt ... that they're going to use a
lot of the cash to pay down debt rather than play Santa Claus.''
   ``Modestly good'' was the forecast from Monroe H. Greenstein, an
analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. Greenstein predicted retailers
would take fewer markdowns than they did last Christmas season
because they've kept their inventories lean.
   ``Most of the sales are going to be planned and part of budgets
and not be sales in the true sense of the word,'' he said.
   Retailers are currently preparing for the holidays. The major
companies are planning special themes and events, and some stores
are already displaying decorations or seasonal merchandise.
   Even consumers who haven't ventured into stores lately know _
from the Christmas catalogs spilling out of their mailboxes _ that
the holiday season is fast approaching.
   Christmas is make-it-or-break it time for retailers because they
earn as much of 60 percent of their annual profits during the
fourth quarter. But even if this season proves to be unexciting,
there is little fear that earnings will suffer.
   ``Retailers are generally lean on their inventories heading into
Christmas,'' said Buchanan. Less merchandise on hand means less
merchandise to be marked down at the end of the season.
   Lean inventories have become a way of retail life, and not just
at holiday time. After sales softened last year and a hoped-for
recovery never materialized, storeowners learned to reduce their
merchandise levels and cut expenses.
   But if retail executives are depressed or resigned because
business is slow, they don't show it.
   ``We have lived with the softness with consumer sales long
enough that we've turned to optimism,'' said Kenneth Macke,
chairman of Dayton Hudson Corp. ``We've learned to live with it,
learned to control inventories very well, learned how to make the
consumer happy.''
   ``We feel that even with sluggish sales, we can have earnings
increases,'' Macke said.
   Greenstein, the Bear Stearns analyst, agreed that retailers have
gotten used to the new environment.
   ``They're placing greater emphasis on profitability and less on
sales,'' he said.
   Added Buchanan, ``Smarter retailers (are) closing poorer stores
and reinvesting resources into their better stores. ... you're
seeing a paring of overhead and a reduction of buying staffs, a
reduction of floor help and a reduction at the expense level.''
   This doesn't mean, however, that retailers are standing still.
Macke noted that his company recently bought 31 Gold Circle stores
in order to help expand its Target discount store division.
   At K mart, ``We're probably going to see some acceleration in
our store opening program,'' and the company continues to add new
technology such as inventory control systems and satellite dishes
to communicate with its far-flung stores, Wellman said.
   And although sales may be sluggish, the stores are still
pursuing customers.
   According to Macke, retailers must find a formula that attracts
consumers who are better educated today and who are concerned with
value _ getting a good deal on good merchandise.
   ``We made an effort to improve our quality in all our
companies,'' he said. ``If you have merchandise that is well-priced
but does not have the quality the consumer wants, they won't
spend.''
   The top retailers today, according to Buchanan, are those that
find an untapped market and stake a claim there _ as the discount
retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. did.
   Wal-Mart, arguably the most successful retailer in the country,
set up shop mostly in small towns, offered low prices and
emphasized customer service. The company consistently outperforms
its competitors, and was one of the few bright stars in this past
lackluster year.
   ``Anybody who has a defined niche where they do very well is
continuing to do well,'' Buchanan said.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. has agreed to buy
International Business Machine Corp.'s existing copier service,
sales and lease agreements in 16 countries, a Kodak spokesman said
Wednesday.
   The agreement follows a similar one in April that transferred
IBM's U.S. copier service and sales agreements to Kodak, effective
July 1, said Kodak spokesman Ron Roberts.
   Terms were not disclosed in either deal.
   At the time of the first deal, stock analysts said the move
would benefit both companies, allowing Kodak to gain a stronger
presence in the copier market and giving IBM the opportunity to
concentrate on its forte, computers.
   Thirteen European countries are covered under the agreement
including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, West Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom.
   The three non-European countries are Argentina, Australia and
Canada.
   The transition from IBM to Kodak will be made on a
country-by-country basis and will involve further discussions and
agreements with respective subsidiaries and be subject to local
laws and customs, Roberts said.
   He said Kodak may recruit IBM copier service employees in some
countries. Those who wish to remain with IBM will be offered other
opportunities in the company.

<HEAD>Wendy's To Offer Food For Credit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wendy's Internation Inc. plans to offer
food for payment by credit card at a dozen restaurants in Ohio
beginning in November, company officials said Tuesday.
   The fast-food chain, based in Dublin, will test a new payment
system that will allow cash-short customers to pay for their food
with a VISA card.
   Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications, said 12
test locations in central Ohio have been selected for the program,
which should be in operation early next month.
   Wendy's is the second fast-food chain to try credit cards.
Seventeen Arby's restaurants in Arizona already have tried the
program with success.
   David Brigham, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based VISA,
said within two weeks after the Arby's promotion began, 2 percent
of all transactions at the test restaurants were made by credit
card.
   Lynch said the new system will be fast enough to satisfy
customers in a hurry.
   ``They have a payment system that is a terminal that is so fast,
that you can do it in two to five seconds,'' he said. Customers
will not have to sign a charge slip and will not be given a carbon
to record the transaction.
   He also said no credit check will be conducted on transactions
less than $25 and that the restaurants will set no minimum or
maximum purchase limits.
   Brigham said that studies have shown that people tend to spend
more when they can use a credit card.
   Wendy's restaurants in Columbus, Grove City, Hilliard,
Westerville, Sunbury, Jeffersonville and Mount Vernon will be
involved in the testing.

   With pressure growing to come up with a
way to limit gushing oil production, ministers from eight OPEC
nations are meeting Thursday for further talks on the persistent
disarray in the world oil market.
   ``It's a big showdown,'' said Peter Gignoux, director of the
international energy department at the Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
brokerage in London.
   ``The time has come to see whether certain OPEC producers will
conform to new quotas,'' he said. ``If they don't conform, we will
have pure chaos in OPEC.''
   Saudi Arabia and other nations have been producing above their
quotas, jockeying for position in advance of the Thursday meeting
in Madrid, Spain, and a gathering Nov. 21 in Vienna, Austria, of
all 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The pickup in production has added to already plentiful world
supplies and kept prices weak on the volatile oil market. Prices
have been seesawing in recent weeks between $12 and $16 a barrel,
which is still well below OPEC's target of $18.
   Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia and three other Arab members of
OPEC called on the cartel's members to restrain production but also
recommended that OPEC boost its official output ceiling, excluding
Iraq, from about 15 million barrels a day to a minimum of 17.4
million barrels.
   The ceiling proposed by these Arab nations, members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council, would include Iraq but would be well under
OPEC's current total production of an estimated 21 million to 22
million barrels a day.
   Gignoux called the suggested cap ``not a workable number.''
   Nick Antill, an oil analyst at the London brokerage County
NatWest, described the outcome of the council talks as ``quite
depressing'' because no new production formula was offered.
   As a result, he said, the Madrid meeting could end with the oil
officials sticking to the current production accord as part of
their ``constant attempt to patch another hole in the dike.''
   The council's proposal would make room for Iraq in the quota
system, allotting it the same share of 2.4 million barrels a day
now held by former enemy Iran. Iraq in the past has refused to
honor its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day because it wanted
parity with Iran.
   Oil prices rose after the council's statement but retreated when
Iran rejected any suggestion of parity with Iraq. Tehran radio said
such an idea was ``totally unprincipled.''
   The Gulf Cooperation Council is comprised of six nations on the
Persian Gulf. Four members, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait and Qatar, also belong to OPEC. The other two nations, Oman
and Bahrain, do not.
   The council's discussions were considered important because of
the influene wielded by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
exporter.
   The Madrid talks, called as a joint meeting of two OPEC
committees, will bring officials of Iran and Iraq to their first
cartel meeting since an August cease-fire in their 8-year-old war.
   Both Iran and Iraq want to export more oil to pay the hefty tabs
of rebuilding their war-damaged economies.
   Analysts estimate Iraq has been pumping at least 2.6 million
barrels of crude a day, an amount that could soar to 3.7 million
barrels in mid-1989 with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi
Arabia to the Red Sea.
   Iran has been producing an estimated 2.5 million barrels daily
analysts say.
   Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia warned other nations it would
continue producing more than its OPEC share unless other cartel
members stuck to their limits. Analysts said the oil giant recently
boosted production to as much as 5.6 million barrels a day, topping
its official quota of 4.3 million barrels.
   The pricing committee, one of the two panels meeting in Madrid,
is made up of Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia and
Venezuela. The other panel, the long-term strategy committee,
includes Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
   The remaining OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.

   Kraft Inc. officials began mulling an $11
billion takeover offer, but industry analysts said the sheer size
of Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s cash bid left the processed-foods
giant nearly defenseless.
   ``My own feeling is that Philip Morris is not going to take no
for an answer,'' said John C. McMillin, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Meanwhile, Kraft on Tuesday reported a 17 percent profit gain in
the third quarter, reflecting the strong earnings growth that is
part of its appeal to Philip Morris.
   Kraft said it was studying Philip Morris' $90-per-share tender
offer, announced Monday, and expected to make a recommendation to
its shareholders by Oct. 31. A purchase at that price would be the
second biggest business acquisition in U.S. history.
   Unidentified sources quoted in today's editions of The New York
Times said the leveraged buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
& Co. may be offering its services to Kraft management. The paper
said the bidding for Kraft could climb by another $1 billion if
Kohlberg enters the fray.
   Kraft closed at $88.37{, up $28.25 Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange in reaction to Philip Morris' unsolicited offer.
   Kraft, based north of Chicago in Glenview, already has indicated
its desire to remain independent. But many analysts who follow the
company say Kraft would be hard-pressed to devise a plan for
raising the value of its stock to the price being offered by
deep-pocketed Philip Morris.
   ``Their options are very limited by the bidder being Philip
Morris and the willingness of Philip Morris to go further if they
have to,'' McMillin said.
   Philip Morris Chairman Hamish Maxwell has indicated his
willingness to ``negotiate an amicable transaction,'' which is
believed to mean he is willing to offer more for Kraft.
   Analysts likened Kraft's situation to that of Pillsbury Co.,
which urged its stockholders on Tuesday to reject Grand
Metropolitan PLC's unsolicited $5.23 billion bid for the food and
restaurant company.
   Grand Met's offer for Pillsbury is about 21 times the company's
earnings; Philip Morris' bid for Kraft is about 26 times Kraft's
earnings.
   ``When you get a pass at you of 22, 23, 24 times earnings, I'd
take the money and run,'' said John Maxwell Jr., an analyst with
Wheat First Securities Inc. in Richmond, Va.
   ``I don't see how you can turn premiums like that down if you're
taking care of your shareholders.''
   Analyst Roger Spencer of PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago said Philip
Morris' bid could spark a bidding war for Kraft, which boasts
strong growth potential and very little debt. But other analysts
dismissed that notion, saying few companies could better the Philip
Morris offer.
   Philip Morris has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Chicago challenging Kraft's first line of defense, a ``poison
pill'' that kicks in when an unwanted suitor acquires 20 percent of
Kraft stock. In that event, Kraft would double the number of shares
held by all other stockholders, making a buyout prohibitively
expensive.
   But analysts said poison pill challenges were standard procedure
in takeover wars and they doubted a battle for Kraft would turn on
the court case.
   Analyst Roy Burry of Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York said
Kraft might bring in a white knight _ a third company with which it
would merge to defeat Philip Morris.
   McMillin said Kraft's only chance to remain independent might be
a ``Pac Man'' defense in which Kraft would turn attacker and offer
to buy Philip Morris in a deal that would be financed by selling
some assets of the New York-based tobacco and food company.
   But McMillin acknowledged that such a scenario was ``a bit
far-fetched.''
   In its third-quarter earnings statement Tuesday, Kraft reported
net income of $148.7 million, or $1.20 per share, for the 13 weeks
ending Sept. 24, compared with $126.9 million, or 92 cents per
share, for the same period a year ago.
   Revenues for the period advanced 12 percent to $2.8 billion from
$2.5 billion.
   The quarterly results include net income of $10 million from
Duracell, the battery division that Kraft sold to a management
group for $685.6 million in the second quarter and which Kraft
counted as a discontinued operation.
   For the first three quarters of 1988, Kraft reported net income
of $1.1 billion, or $8.20 per share, compared with $391.8 million,
or $2.86 per share, for the same period in 1987.
   Sales for the first three quarters advanced 13 percent to $8.3
billion from $7.3 billion.
   The cumulative results for the first three quarters of 1987 were
restated to reflect a $45.2 million gain in the first quarter
resulting from an accounting change.

   Bristol-Myers Co. said Wednesday its profits
rose 16 percent in the third quarter, helped by a healthy increase
in international sales.
   For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, the pharmaceutical
and health products company said it earned $232 million, or 81
cents a share, up from $200 million, or 70 cents a share, a year
earlier. Third-quarter revenue rose 10 percent to $1.52 billion
from $1.38 billion in 1987.
   For the first nine months of the year, Bristol-Myers reported
its net earnings grew 18.3 percent to $633 million, or $2.20 a
share, from $536 million, or $1.87 a share, in the same period in
1987. Revenue totaled $4.49 billion, up 11.2 percent from $4.04
billion in the same nine-month period last year.
   Richard L. Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers, which makes
toiletries, pharmaceuticals, vitamins and infant formula, said the
company's international sales increased 19 percent in the third
quarter.

<HEAD>$14,986 A Share For NTT: Big Price For World's Biggest Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan marked the anniversary of the global stock
market crash with the ultimate vote of confidence _ the largest
equity issue in the world so far this year.
   The release of new shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp., the world's biggest company, appeared to have started
successfully Wednesday despite the stratospheric price of nearly
$15,000 per share.
   The third of at least four NTT issues planned by the government
totaled 1.5 million shares with a value of $22.5 billion.
   Individual shares were priced at 1.9 million yen a share, or
$14,986, calculated at a 3.5 percent discount from Wednesday's
closing price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Even at that whopping per-share price _ considered a bargain by
this market's super-inflated standards _ dealers said the offering
was popular with investors. The price was about 26 percent below
that of the second issue, which was sold last Nov. 10 at $18,854 a
share.
   ``It's a fairly good price, and we hardly had any problems
selling out all of our allotment,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe, a
broker at Nikko Securities Co.
   NTT has a total market value of about $250 billion, qualifying
it for the premier position among the world's corporate giants. By
contrast, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has a market value of
about $29 billion.
   The Finance Ministry is now three-quarters of the way through a
program of selling half of its NTT shares to the public. Foreigners
are not permitted to buy the shares.
   After the first issue of 1.95 million shares, which was offered
at $9,300 per share in February 1987, the share price soared to
$25,000 in less than six months. The second issue, offered at
$18,854, sold easily despite the terrifying global market crash
only three weeks earlier.
   Analyst Ichiro Kitada said the relatively low price of the
latest issue shows the new reality for privatization stocks in
Japan.
   ``The illogical myth that privatization issues are destined to
rise forever was finally proven wrong,'' said Kitada, a private
investment consultant with over 30 years' experience in the
Japanese market.
   The lackluster performance of NTT stock in recent weeks caused
the Finance Ministry in September to reduce the size of the latest
issue from the original 1.95 million to 1.5 million shares. That
sent a signal to the market that pressured the share price to its
lowest level since soon after it was first listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   Analysts attribute the recent slump to a combination of the
overall bearishness of the Tokyo market, uncertainties created by
Emperor Hirohito's illness and concern that NTT shares are
overpriced at about 130 times earnings. The average U.S. stock now
sells for about 13 times earnings.
   ``The Tokyo market itself has not been going anywhere in the
past months. NTT alone can't fly by itself,'' said Watanabe.
   Some analysts believe the Finance Ministry and the securities
industry will not join in propping up the share price because of
public concern over recent scandals involving share-price
manipulation.
   ``It is widely believed that such an alliance to prop up NTT
shares ahead of the past two issues existed,'' said Kitada. ``But
if anything similar to that was done for the current issue in the
middle of media scrutiny and market sensitivity, the public is not
going to tolerate that.''
   Ironically, the decline in price attracted institutional
investors, who bought only 15 percent of the two previous NTT
offers.
   ``In the past two offers, bullishness was the motivation for
buying NTT, but this time, the low price is,'' said Keiichi
Nishida, broker for the Tokyo office of Kidder Peabody. ``I must
say 2 million yen is a good bargain for a piece of that company,
considering its size and performance and potential for growth.''
   Some observers hope the popularity of the new issue will help
shore up the shaky foundations of the Tokyo market, which has shown
signs of instability even as it has outperformed most others around
the world since last October's crash.
   ``It was the most promising share in the market,'' said Mike
Morizumi, an analyst at Merrill Lynch's Tokyo office. ``The market
was aware that it was in everyone's interest to push up NTT shares.
It means more revenue for the Finance Ministry, more commission for
the securities industry and profit for investors.''
   NTT is one of the best performers in Japan's high-growth
economy, showing an after-tax profit for the fiscal year ended
March 31 of 243.24 billion yen ($1.92 billion), up 64 percent from
the previous year.

   Stock prices declined moderately today in a mood
of caution as Wall Street marked the first anniversary of the crash
of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which closed Tuesday at
its highest level since the collapse a year ago, slipped back 9.96
to 2,149.89 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 610 up, 767 down and
531 unchanged.
   Trading activity, which has been sluggish for the past several
months, got a boost on Tuesday following word of Philip Morris's
$11.4 billion takeover bid for Kraft Inc.
   That triggered buying interest in other food stocks, and blue
chips as well.
   But analysts said the memory of the market's record drop a year
ago still was acting as a damper on traders' enthusiasm.
   In addition, some investors seemed to be leery of making big
commitments before the government's scheduled report Friday on the
consumer price index for September.
   Kraft climbed 2\ to 90{ and Philip Morris shares dropped 1] to
94[.
   Besides Philip Morris, losers among the blue chips included
General Electric, down ] at 44\; International Business Machines,
down 1 at 123], and American Telephone & Telegraph, down ] at 27[.
   Apple Computer rose ~ to 40\ in the over-the-counter market. The
company reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept.
30 of 84 cents a share, up from 54 cents in the comparable period a
year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.43 to 156.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .75 at 304.90.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 134.39 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>European Trade Officials Seek to Allay American Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European trade officials sought
Wednesday to put to rest American fears that the giant consumer
market that will be formed in Western Europe in 1992 will
discriminate against U.S. and other foreign firms.
   Willy De Clercq, the top trade official of the European Economic
Community, told reporters, ``1992 will not mean protectionism. ...
It would be absurd for the community to move toward a policy of
protectionism.''
   De Clercq and other top officials of the 12-nation trading bloc
issued a statement designed to spell out the implications for other
countries of the move to create a single, European-wide market by
the end of 1992.
   To meet that goal, the 12 nations of the European Community,
also known as the Common Market, are dismantling trade barriers
that separate them.
   The United States has repeatedly expressed concern that in
lifting restrictions on internal trade, the Europeans might try to
keep out U.S. and other foreign competition.
   But De Clercq insisted that fears the Europeans will set up new
barriers to trade and form a ``Fortress Europe'' were ``senseless
and groundless.''
   ``I hope the very clear signals that this commission (the bloc's
executive body) has given in order to show its willingness ... to
be a world partner and not a fortress can help alleviate all kinds
of fears,'' he said.
   De Clercq and Lord Cockfield, the top official for the internal
market, also sought to allay concerns about the community's use of
the word reciprocity in discussing how much access foreign firms
will have in business fields such as financial services not yet
governed by international trade rules.
   ``I would like to express my astonishment,'' said De Clercq,
``that this word gives rise to such emotional reactions.''
   ``What we do not want is for reciprocity to mean something other
than the same advantages for everyone,'' he said.
   ``We do not have the intention of asking all our partners to
make the same concessions,'' he said.
   The Common Market, he said, was not considering ``identical
reciprocity'' but rather ``equivalent reciprocity,'' which he
described as ``the balance of advantages, a fair deal, where
everyone stands to benefit.''
   The statement issued by the trade group said the community
``will offer free access to 1992 benefits for firms from countries
whose market is already open or which are prepared to open up their
markets.''
   U.S. officials fear the use of a reciprocity guideline will
subject U.S. banks to crippling restrictions because American
banking rules are much tighter than those in some European
countries. The Glass-Steagall Act separates commercial and
investment banking in the United States, a distinction not
recognized in parts of Europe.
   U.S. officials want the Common Market to apply a standard of
national treatment to foreign firms so that U.S. banks and other
operations will be treated in the new market just like European
companies.
   Cockfield said the reciprocity clause was put in a draft
proposal on 1992 banking rules as a bargaining tool to open up
other countries' markets during the current round of international
trade negotiations.
   ``Our objective here,'' he said, ``is not a restrictive one. It
is ultimately one of getting the most liberal regime that can be
negotiated in the world as a whole.''
   He said, however, that the community would take a look at the
amount of access given European firms in a foreign country when one
of its companies makes an initial application to operate in the
European market.
   He dismissed speculation that the community would try to limit
the operations of companies that are already established in the
community.
   ``I find it difficult to envisage a situation in which we would
want to do that sort of thing,'' he said.
   Spokesmen for the U.S. mission to the Common Market were in a
meeting and could not be immediately reached for comment.
   Cockfield also cautioned the United States and Japan against
taking protectionist steps that would force the Europeans to
respond.
   ``The great threat to a liberal world trading system is
protectionist legislation in America and protectionist attitudes in
Japan,'' he said. ``It is this sort of thing that generates a mood
in which people talk about retaliation.''
   The trading group is made up of Britain, Ireland, Belgium,
France, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, Spain,
Luxembourg and Italy.

while another large banking company, Bankers Trust New York Corp.,
had higher earnings.
   Meanwhile, Great Western Financial Corp., one of the nation's
largest thrift holding companies, said its net income jumped about
20 percent in the July-September period.
   First Interstate, ranked eighth among the nation's banking
companies, said its third-quarter loss more than doubled to $214.4
million from $78.75 a year ago. For the first nine months, it lost
$14.63 million, vs. a $508.48 million shortfall in 1987.
   The Los Angeles company said it was in the red due to its
decision to spin off about $400 million in non-performing assets
and add $180 million for loan and foreclosed property reserves of
its Texas subsidiary.
   Excluding those special items, First Interstate said, it would
have earned $94.2 million, or $1.95 a share, in the third quarter
and $268.1 million, or $5.72 a share, for the year to date.
   Pittsburgh-based Mellon also attributed its financial woes _ a
$166 million quarterly loss, compared with a year-ago profit of $16
million, or 47 cents a share _ to several one-time expenses. For
the nine-month period Mellon recorded a $113 million loss, compared
with a $610 million loss in 1987.
   The nation's 15th largest banking concern said its quarterly
results included a $203 million restructuring expense from the
anticipated sale of several assets to Grant Street National Bank.
   Bankers Trust, ranked ninth, said it netted $162.1 million, or
$2.01 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, up 11 percent
from the $15.7 million, or $2.03 a share, it earned a year ago.
   For the first three quarters of 1988, net income totaled $462.2
million, compared with a net loss of $283.3 million last year, when
the New York company added $700 million to its loan-loss provision
to cover troubled Third World debt.
   Bankers Trust said its loan-loss provision totaled $5 million in
the third quarter, $15 million less than a year earlier, and that
helped improve earnings. The company also reported strong interest
and non-interest income.
   Great Western, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., and ranked third
among savings and loan companies, said it earned $68 million, or 53
cents per share, in the third quarter. That was 21 percent higher
than year-ago earnings of $56 million, or 44 cents a share.
   For the nine months, net income totaled $189 million, or $1.48 a
share, vs. $198 million, or $1.55 a share, in 1987.
   The company said increased real estate loan commitments were at
an all-time high and helped earnings.

   Stock prices showed a moderate loss today in a
mood of caution as Wall Street marked the first anniversary of the
crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which closed Tuesday at
its highest level since the collapse a year ago, slipped back 12.09
to 2,147.76 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 606 up, 774 down and
556 unchanged.
   Trading activity, which has been sluggish for the past several
months, got a boost on Tuesday following word of Philip Morris's
$11.4 billion takeover bid for Kraft Inc.
   That triggered buying interest in other food stocks, and blue
chips as well.
   But analysts said the memory of the market's record drop a year
ago still was acting as a damper on traders' enthusiasm.
   In addition, some investors seemed to be leery of making big
commitments before the government's scheduled report Friday on the
consumer price index for September.
   Kraft climbed 2[ to 90] and Philip Morris shares dropped 1| to
93~.
   Besides Philip Morris, losers among the blue chips included
General Electric, down { at 44[; International Business Machines,
down 1{ at 122~, and American Telephone & Telegraph, down ] at 27[.
   Apple Computer rose ~ to 40\ in the over-the-counter market. The
company reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept.
30 of 84 cents a share, up from 54 cents in the comparable period a
year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.50 to 156.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .87 at 305.02.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 149.39 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Wheat and soybean futures, bolstered by a slight
pickup in foreign demand, closed modestly higher Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade while corn and oat futures prices finished
mostly lower.
   Exporters said Egypt had purchased 250,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices and China bought 170,000 metric tons,
also at prices subsidized under an Agriculture Department program
to boost exports.
   Taiwan was said to have purchased 27,000 metric tons of U.S.
soybeans at market prices and was expected to bid for another
54,000 metric tons tonight.
   The sales lifted the spirits of market bulls, who have been
dismayed by a general slowdown in export business and by the
failure of government negotiators to hammer out a new long-term
agreement for Soviet purchases of U.S. grain, analysts said.
   Until the trade picture improves or some other major change in
market fundamentals occurs, ``the markets will continue to lack
conviction and meander in a fairly narrow range without any real
force behind them,'' said Rich Feltes, director of commodities
research for Refco Inc., a commodities brokerage based in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 2} cents to 3} cents higher with
December at $4.26} a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1} cents lower

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was little changed Wednesday in
slow trading in Europe. Gold prices finished lower after a choppy
session.
   Foreign exchange dealers said that in the absence of
market-affecting news, the dollar traded in a narrow range.
   ``Bearish sentiment is intact, but there is a lack of confidence
and a lack of ammunition to push the dollar below its recent
range,'' said Nigel Green, assistant director at EBC Amro Bank Ltd.
in London.
   A report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial
daily, said U.S. and Japanese central banks might be willing to
coordinate action to prevent the dollar falling further against the
yen.
   Some dealers said speculation about central bank intervention
was keeping the market jittery about pushing the dollar lower,
although the major central banks have not been sighted supporting
the American currency in the open market this week.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.85 yen to a closing 126.85 yen from
127.70 yen late Tuesday. Later, in London, it was quoted at 127.20
yen.
   In London, the dollar was unchanged against the British pound.
It cost $1.7515 to buy one pound, the same price as late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates: 1.8115 West German marks, up from 1.8050; 1.5275 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5280; 6.1710 French francs, down from 6.1735;
2.0380 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0390; 1,347.625 Italian lire, up
from 1,345.50; and 1.19955 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20095.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $411.05 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $412.95. In Zurich, gold was lower,
closing at a bid $410.00 compared with $411.00 late Tuesday.
   Hong Kong financial institutions were closed for a Chinese
festival.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.35 a troy ounce, compared
with Tuesday's $6.39.

<HEAD>Apple Computer, Microsoft Report Big Quarterly Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. on Wednesday reported a 51 percent earnings
gain in its fiscal fourth quarter while Wang Laboratories Inc. said
its first-quarter profit fell 41 percent.
   Meanwhile, computer software maker Microsoft Corp. said its
first-quarter net income soared 72 percent.
   Apple, a major producer of personal computers based in
Cupertino, Calif., said net income for its final quarter ended
Sept. 30 was $107.9 million, or 84 cents per share, on sales of
$1.1 billion. That compared with earnings of $71.7 million, or 54
cents a share, and sales of $786 million in 1987.
   For the full fiscal year, Apple earned $400.3 million, or $3.08
a share, up 84 percent from the $217.5 million, or $1.65 per share,
netted a year ago. Sales rose 53 percent, to $4.1 billion from $2.7
billion.
   Wang, a producer of office computers based in Lowell, Mass.,
reported net income of $13.1 million, or 8 cents a share, in its
first quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $22.5
million, or 14 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $723
million from $693 million.
   Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., earned $36.6 million, or 65
cents a share, on revenue of $176.4 million for its fiscal first
quarter ended Sept. 30. A year ago it had a profit of $21.3
million, or 38 cents a share, and $102.6 million in revenue.
   Apple Chairman John Sculley said its latest earnings report
marked the company's 10th consecutive quarterly growth in sales and
earnings.
   ``This performance underscores the continued success of Apple
Computer and is due, in large part, to our success with the
Macintosh product family in business markets around the world,'' he
said.
   Wang said international revenue grew about 11 percent but was
offset by sluggish domestic demand. The company also blamed its
earnings decline on the costs of recent product introductions and
associated marketing programs.
   For Microsoft, the first-quarter results represented the 12th
consecutive record for revenue.
   Chief Financial Officer Frank Gaudette said Microsoft's
international sales remained strong, accounting for 48.8 percent of
the company's business for the quarter.
   During the past quarter, Microsoft introduced an updated version
of its Excel spreadsheet program and an expanded version of its
MS-DOS computer operating system for International Business
Machines Corp. and compatible personal computers.

<HEAD>Gulf Storms Reduce Domestic Oil Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Storms in the Gulf of Mexico last month forced
domestic oil production to its lowest level in more than a decade,
the American Petroleum Institute reported Wednesday.
   September's oil production was estimated at 7.94 million barrels
a day, a reduction of some 267,000 barrels a day from a year ago.
It was the first time in more than 10 years that domestic oil
production fell below 8 million barrels, the trade group said.
   More than 100,000 barrels a day of the loss was attributed to
two hurricanes, one that passed across offshore oil fields as it
moved into Louisiana and another that threatened the same area
before eventually hitting northern Mexico. Both forced the shutdown
of several refineries and production platforms.
   Meanwhile, petroleum imports remained at 6.9 million barrels a
day in September the despite storm-related shipment delays, the
trade group said. For the first nine months of the year, imports
were up 6.8 percent, or 440,000 barrels a day, from last year.
   In other areas, the report said:
   _Deliveries of refined petroleum products climbed 1.1 percent to
16.9 million barrels in September, compared with a year ago.
   _Gasoline deliveries increased 1.2 percent to 7.3 million
barrels, with premium unleaded gasoline's share of the market
climbing to 23 percent from 20 percent last year, and leaded
gasoline's share dropping to 17 percent.
   _Deliveries of distillate oil, which includes home heating oil
and diesel fuel fell 0.2 percent in September, due in part to the
technical corrections bill now before Congress.
   The measure, which may become law before the end of the year,
includes a provision making it unnecessary for farmers and other
off-highway users of diesel fuel to pre-pay the federal excise tax.
Many users apparently have postponed their purchases in
anticipation of the bill's passage, the oil group said.
   _Crude oil inventories fell for the third month in a row to 324
million barrels, the lowest level in more than a year. Distillate
stocks, meanwhile, rose 7 million barrels and stood at 3 million
barrels higher than a year earlier. Total stocks exceeded 1 billion
barrels.

<HEAD>Government To Investigage Consolidated Gold Share Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday appointed inspectors to
investigate possible insider trading of stock in Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC ahead of a takeover bid by South African-controlled
Minorco SA.
   Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said the investigators
have been asked to report to him ``as quickly as possible''
concerning possible insider trading and concert-party share
ownership of the company's stock. This occurs when one company
secretly agrees to buy stock for another firm.
   The investigation, announced shortly after the close of the
London stock market, is being conducted at the request of the
company, Young said.
   Consolidated Gold Fields has alleged that insider dealing and
share building by parties related to Minorco occurred in the weeks
ahead of the Sept. 21 launch of the bid, which it is fighting.
   It said the activity was ``fully consistent with insider dealers
having knowledge of both the time and value of the bid.''
   The company claims that the activity affected its chances of
fending off the takeover attempt.
   The investigation comes less than a week ahead of the Oct. 25
close of the Minorco bid. Minorco is offering 19 pounds ($33) cash
and one new Minorco share for every two Gold Fields shares.
   A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said the
Minorco bid would not necessarily be stopped if the investigation
turns up evidence of insider trading or concert-party purchases.
Minorco has also called for an investigation of share dealings
ahead of the bid.
   The Department of Trade's Office of Fair Trading is also
expected to make a recommendation shortly on whether the bid should
be investigated for its impact on competition.
   Consolidated Gold Fields' shares closed Wednesday at 12.20
pounds ($21.35), off 35 pence (61 cents) from Tuesday.

   An afternoon wave of selling pushed stock prices
lower today in a mood of caution as Wall Street marked the first
anniversary of the crash of 1987.
   Most of the downward pressure on the market came in a brief
period shortly before the close.
   Analysts pointed to weakness in the bond market and some selling
by professional traders engaged in computer program strategies.
   Another apparent source of selling, brokers said, was a rumor
making the rounds of Wall Street that a newspaper story potentially
damaging to the presidential campaign of Vice President Bush would
be published Thursday.
   The newspaper concerned denied the rumor.

<HEAD>BellSouth Reports Flat Earnings, Ameritech Profits Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two regional Bell telephone companies reported lackluster
third-quarter results Tuesday, with BellSouth Corp. announcing its
profits were flat and Ameritech posting a 23 percent earnings
decline.
   Atlanta-based BellSouth said its earnings totaled $419.6
million, or 89 cents a share, compared with $418.6 million, or 87
cents a share, in the third quarter of 1987.
   Revenue increased to $3.46 billion from $3.11 billion a year
earlier.
   The company, whose telephone units include Southern Bell and
South Central Bell, said earnings growth was held in check partly
because of accounting changes ordered by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   BellSouth said its earnings for the first nine months of the
year totaled $597.1 million, or $2.61 per share, down 23 percent
from $777.5 million, or $2.61 per share, in the same period of 1987.
   The company had sharply higher expenses during the first three
quarters of this year.
   Revenue for the period totaled $10.02 billion, compared with
$9.08 billion a year earlier.
   Chicago-based Ameritech said its earnings for the third quarter
totaled $281.1 million, or $2.07 per share, compared with $301.1
million, or $2.16 per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   The company, the parent of Bell telephone companies serving
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, said its earnings
were reduced by charges related to the sale of its systems software
subsidiary, Applied Data Research Inc.
   The company reported third-quarter revenue of $2.51 billion, up
from $2.43 billion in the 1987 quarter.
   Ameritech reported nine-month earnings of $927.7 million, or
$6.80 a share, up 7 percent from $865.9 million, or $6.14 a share,
in the same period a year ago.
   Revenue for the first three quarters increased to $7.4 billion
from $7.1 billion.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor's Earnings for Quarter Dip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp. said Wednesday an
Electric Boat division strike and continued investments in advanced
aerospace programs combined to lower the defense contractor's
third-quarter earnings by 13.5 percent.
   General Dynamics had earnings of $96.4 million, or $2.29 per
share, compared with $111.5 million, or $2.62 per share, for the
same period in 1987. Earnings for the year's first nine months were
$268.8 million, or $6.39 per share, compared with $342 million, or
$7.99 per share, one year earlier.
   Sales of $2.3 billion for the third quarter and $7 billion for
the first nine months compared with those of $2.3 billion and $6.9
billion in 1987.
   General Dynamics' funded backlog at the end of the third quarter
was $15.8 billion and its total backlog, funded and unfunded, was
$22.9 billion, representing approximately 2.4 years of sales, the
company said. Comparable figures a year ago were $15.2 billion and
$22.9 billion.
   Stanley C. Pace, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
work stoppage at the Electric Boat division in Groton, Conn., was
the principal cause of General Dynamics' third-quarter decline.
   ``However, we believe that terms of the Oct. 11 (Electric Boat)
labor settlement improve our position for future submarine
competitions,'' Pace said. ``Our recent award of the 16th Trident
submarine continues our role as the sole builder of that very
important class.''
   Cited also by Pace were continued investments in the Atlas
expendable launch vehicle program and advanced aerospace programs,
particularly the Air Force's advanced tactical fighter.
   ``While these programs are currently incurring high development
costs, we expect them to make significant contributions to
operating earnings in the long term,'' Pace said. ``Our overall
commitment to cost containment is evidenced at Land Systems and at
Cessna, both of which show improved earnings.''

<HEAD>Crash-Suit Mania Never Came, But Out-Of Court Arbitrations Up
Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most investors hurt by the stock crash a year
ago Wednesday didn't rush into court to sue brokers for negligence,
contrary to expectations of a litigation tidal wave, lawyers and
securities professionals say.
   Reviewing what happened a year after the collapse erased $500
billion in paper profits, they offered several explanations for the
surprisingly few suits. For one thing, many disputes were
arbitrated outside of court; for another, many investors simply
realized that severe risk is part of the stock market game.
   ``I think people sort of assessed this as a freak act of
nature,'' said William Fitzpatrick, general counsel of the
Securities Industry Association, a trade group of brokerages.
``Certain things happen in life that are nobody's fault, like a
hurricane.''
   At this time last year, Fitzpatrick and others in the securities
business were bracing for an onslaught of suits by investors who
felt betrayed by the stunning collapse in prices after five years
of record growth.
   Many complained about their inability to execute orders or even
get brokers on the telephone as their portfolios tumbled in value.
Some accused brokers of panicking and selling their own positions
before taking care of clients.
   The number of crash-related lawsuits remains unclear, partly
because there is no one single group that keeps track of such
statistics.
   ``All I have are anecdotal things which I've discussed with
others,'' said Fitzpatrick. ``Almost universally, they've said they
anticipated a dramatic increase and it just hasn't materialized.''
   Part of the reason is that as the emotions raised by the crash
eased, a good deal of these gripes were resolved by rational
discussions between investors and brokers.
   Other investors reckoned that even with their losses, they had
still done better in the market over the past several years.
   ``Some realized it was an overall market situation and decided
to be big boys and girls and take their lumps,'' said Edward
McDevitt, a prominent securities-law litigator in Charleston, W.
Va. ``Many of these people are still way ahead.''
   Some securities industry critics say the lack of lawsuits is
deceptive and to a great extent reflects the language in many
brokerage contracts requiring disputes to be settled by arbitration.
   The North American Securities Administrators Assocation, a group
of state securities regulators, says the number of arbitration
cases soared after crash.
   In a survey released earlier this month, the association also
said two out of three small investors who encountered problems with
brokers during the crash have not been able to resolve their
complaints.
   The New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and
National Association of Securities Dealers, the electronic
over-the-counter market, have all experienced sharp rises in the
number of arbitration cases.
   At the American Arbitration Association, which also handles
securities-related disputes, the number of broker-investor cases
more than quadrupled in the 12 months since the crash compared with
the 12 months preceding it, said George Friedman, vice president
for case administration.
   ``It's also very clear from talking to people who've gone into
arbitration that if they had the option of going to court, they
definitely would have,'' said Scott Stapf, director of investor
education for the North American Securities Administrators group.
   Others strongly disagree. Stephen Ratner, a New York attorney
who represents Bear, Stearns & Co., a defendant in one of the few
prominent crash-related suits filed, said: ``The story with the
crash is there's no story. It's a situation in which the brokers
aren't to blame.''
   He has moved to dismiss the complaint against Bear Stearns by a
group of investors who blame the firm for several million dollars
in stock losses during the crash.

<HEAD>No Progress In First Colt Negotiations In 17 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WETHERSFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first negotiating session in
nearly 17 months between striking United Auto Workers and officials
of the Colt Firearms Division broke off Wednesday after just 14
minutes of mediated talks.
   ``There was no movement,'' said Robert Madore, president of UAW
Local 376. ``We met (separately) for about 12 minutes, broke up,
came back face to face for another two minutes and broke up.''
   Madore said the company and the union are still deadlocked over
the issue of whether the company can keep the 725 replacement
workers it has hired to replace the strikers.
   ``The company's position is that the replacement workers stay,''
Madore said. ``We're not going to cave in on that. All the strikers
have to go back.''
   Richard Reibeling, vice president for personnel at Colt Firearms
Division and the company's chief negotiator, said the two parties
are ``180 degrees apart,'' with the issue of replacement workers at
the center of the dispute.
   The strike began in January 1986 when 1,000 members of UAW Local
376 struck over a failure of both sides to reach a new contract
after months of negotiations.
   The company hired replacements at its Hartford and West Hartford
plants and production has continued throughout the strike. In
addition, 200 union members have returned to work, company
officials said.
   Wednesday's talks, held under the guidance of state and federal
mediators at the state Department of Labor offices in Wethersfield,
were the first since negotiators for the union and Colt met on May
27, 1987.
   State Department of Labor spokesman Richard Ficks said no date
has been set for future talks.

<TEXT>
   Pitney Bowes Inc. said Wednesday that net
income for the third quarter rose 18 percent and attributed the
gain to strong performances in its mailing, shipping, copying,
voice processing and facsimile businesses.
   The Stamford-based company said this year's third-quarter income
of $54 million, or 68 cents per share, compared to $46 million, or
58 cents per share, in the same period last year.
   Last year's third-quarter income included $984,000 from
discontinued operations, the company said.
   Revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to $571.9 million
compared with $505.3 million in the third quarter of 1987.
   Net income for the first nine months of 1988 increased 25
percent to $164.5 million, or $2.09 per share, from $131.5 million,
or $1.66 per share in 1987.
   Revenue for the first nine months of 1988 increased 14 percent
to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion.

   Stock prices fell Wednesday, yielding to an
afternoon round of selling in a mood of caution as Wall Street
marked the first anniversary of the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 30
points at its low point in the last hour of trading, closed with a
22.58 loss at 2,137.27.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
561 up, 912 down and 502 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 186.35 million
shares, up from 162.50 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 216.87 million shares.
   Most of the downward pressure on the market came in a brief
period shortly before the close.
   Analysts pointed to weakness in the bond market and some selling
by professional traders engaged in computer program strategies.
   Another apparent source of selling, brokers said, was a rumor
making the rounds of Wall Street that the Washington Post would
publish on Thursday a story potentially damaging to the
presidential campaign of Vice President Bush.
   The Post denied the rumor. ``There is no such story,'' said
Robert Kaiser, assistant managing editor-national news.
   In addition, brokers said some investors were leery of making
big commitments before the government's scheduled report Friday on
the consumer price index for September.
   From its close of 1,738.74 on Black Monday, the Dow Jones
industrial average has since recovered 398.53 points, or 22.9
percent. But by all accounts the memory of the big drop has
dampened trading volume and enthusiasm for the market at a time
when the economy is generally in strong shape.
   Kraft climbed 2[ to 90] and Philip Morris dropped 1{ to 94 in
their second session of trading since Philip Morris offered to
acquire Kraft for $90 a share in a $11.4 billion transaction.
   Some other food stocks continued to rise in sympathy with Kraft.
Borden gained 2} to 59\ and CPC International was up 1\ at 56}.
   Besides Philip Morris, losers among the blue chips included
General Electric, down { at 44[; International Business Machines,
down 2 at 122], and American Telephone & Telegraph, down | at 26~.
   Apple Computer rose | to 40 in the over-the-counter market. The
company reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept.
30 of 84 cents a share, up from 54 cents in the comparable period a
year earlier.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $17.93 billion, or 0.65
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.14 to 156.18.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 2.63 to 318.51, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.41 at 276.97.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped .49 to 385.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 304.48, up .33.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher In US Trading; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened slightly in U.S. trading
Wednesday after barely budging abroad, but foreign exchange traders
said the late movement was caused largely by internal market
conditions and not outside news.
   Gold prices were narrowly mixed in the United States after
falling slightly overseas in choppy trading, which bullion brokers
attributed largely to the effect of vacillating oil prices on the
gold market.
   Oil prices jumped 79 cents a barrel in hectic trading one day
after they fell 60 cents, reflecting ambivalence about the effect
of an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ministerial
meeting. Gold, an historical hedge against inflation, tends to move
in the opposite direction of oil prices.
   Currency brokers said the dollar continued to trade in a narrow
range based on technical factors and was unaffected by external
events. Many expected that trend to persist at least until after
the November election.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.85 yen to 126.85 yen. Later in
London it was quoted at 127.20 yen. By the time trading ended in
New York, the dollar fetched 127.38 yen, up from 127.15 yen late
Tuesday.
   The dollar was unchanged against the British pound in London,
where it cost $1.7515 to buy one pound, the same as late Tuesday.
Later in New York, the pound strengthened to $1.7517 vs. $1.7480
late Tuesday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. rates late Tuesday
included: 1.8120 West German marks, up from 1.8112; 1.5312 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5292; 1.1994 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2007;
6.1905 French francs, up from 6.1675; and 1,348.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,346.50.
   Other late-dollar rates in Europe vs. rates late Tuesday: 1.8115
marks, up from 1.8050; 1.5275 Swiss francs, down from 1.5280;
6.1710 French francs, down from 6.1735; 2.0380 Dutch guilders, down
from 2.0390; 1,347.625 Italian lire, up from 1,345.50; and 1.19955
Canadian dollars, down from 1.20095.
   In gold trading, Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$411.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $1.10 from the same time
Tuesday.
   Gold for current delivery fell 40 cents a troy ounce to $411.40
on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Earlier in London gold fell
$1.90 an ounce to $411.05 and in Zurich if fell $1 to $410. Gold
didn't trade in Hong Kong because markets were closed for a holiday.
   Silver for current delivery fell 1.8 cents a troy ounce on the
New York Comex to $6.337. In London, silver fell 4 cents to $6.35.

<HEAD>Shearson's Third-Quarter Net Tumbles; PaineWebber Posts Slight
Gain</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout to include PaineWebber. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., one of the nation's
biggest investment firms, reported an 85 percent drop in
third-quarter earnings Wednesday, attributing it to post-crash
investor apathy, expenses from the purchase of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc. and higher short-term interest rates.
   PaineWebber Group Inc. also reported a lack of retail and
institutional activity, but the firm managed to post a sharp gain
in the quarter partly on the sale of its interest in a car rental
company.
   Issuing its third-quarter results on the anniversary of the
stock crash a year ago, Shearson said it earned $8 million or 2
cents a share in the three months ended Sept. 30, vs. $54 million
or 54 cents a share a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenues totaled $2.63 billion, up 67 percent from
the $1.57 billion a year earlier, prior to the December acquisition
of Hutton.
   For the first nine months of the year, Shearson reported
earnings of $140 million or $1.39 a share, down 29 percent from the
$196 million or $2.16 a share reported a year earlier. Results this
year included $144 million in pretax, one-time acquisition-related
expenses.
   Nine-month revenues totaled $7.64 billion, up 54 percent from
$4.96 billion a year earlier.
   ``The decline in the third quarter and year-to-date earnings
reflects a significant decrease in investor participation in the
financial markets, along with non-recurring, merger-related
expenses that we are incurring this year,'' Peter A. Cohen,
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
   ``In addition, third-quarter net interest income declined from
the year-ago period, due largely to a narrower interest margin
caused by a rise in short-term rates,'' he said. ``These factors
more than offset strong results in investment banking, market
making and principal transactions and investment advisory
businesses.''
   The company largely has completed the incorporation of Hutton
and a major cost-cutting program, which resulted in the layoffs of
thousands of ex-Hutton employees. Nevertheless, Cohen said, because
of business conditions, ``we plan to continue company-wide efforts
to further reduce operating expenses.''
   There was no elaboration, but many Wall Street professionals
have said privately that unless business improves in the next six
months, they expect further layoffs and cutbacks.
   At PaineWebber, third-quarter earnings jumped 41 percent to
$20.9 million, or 50 cents a share, from $14.8 million, or 44 cents
a share a year ago.
   Revenue during the period advanced at a much slower pace,
however. Revenue totaled $642.4 million in the quarter, up 2
percent from $628.6 million a year ago.
   The company noted that the sale of its investment in National
Car Rental System Inc. contributed a $46 million pretax gain during
the third quarter. Otherwise, the company said overall results
continue to be negatively affected by a lack of investor activity
since the market crash.
   For the first nine months, earnings fell 36 percent to $41.8
million, or 77 cents a share, from $65 million, or $2.01 a share a
year earlier. Revenue for the year-to-date totaled $1.8 billion,
down from $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 1987.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge On Continuing Labor Strike in Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices soared nearer to record highs Wednesday on
New York's Commodity Exchange on fears that a work stoppage in
Peru, the world's sixth largest copper producer, would further
reduce already tight supplies of the metal.
   On other markets, precious metals were lower; energy futures
surged; grains and soybeans were mixed; livestock and meat were
mixed and stock-index futures retreated.
   Copper for spot delivery settled 3.7 cents higher at $1.417 a
pound, just 4.3 cents below the all-time Comex high of $1.46
reached last Dec. 31. Copper for delivery in December settled
$1.335, up 5.55 cents.
   ``There's a very strong chance copper could well take out the
$1.50 area on a spot level basis,'' said George Anagnos, metals
analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   Labor problems have already cost Peru a 17 percent decline in
copper production through August of this year, Anagnos said. The
current miners' walkout, which began on Tuesday, demonstrates that
``the labor situation in Peru and the copper mining situation in
Peru is something we can't bank on,'' Anagnos said.
   Analysts said overall copper production outside of North America
was expected to decline this year. The United States was the
world's second-largest copper producer last year, just behind
Chile, and Canada ranked third.
   Yet demand for the metal has been strong in recent weeks due to
seasonal factors and to the strong economies of the major
industrialized nations.
   The American Bureau of Metal Statistics reported domestic
refined copper inventories of 52,500 short tons at the end of
August, a seemingly healthy gain from 42,000 short tons in June.
But more than half of the increase was due to a buildup in Comex
warehouse stocks, which have declined rapidly since August.
   Furthermore, the August ABMS figure was more than 35 percent
below the Dec. 31, 1987, level and nearly 63 percent lower than
that for August 1987.
   Precious metals prices finished slightly lower on the Comex.
   Gold settled 40 cents lower across the board with December at
$414.70 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2.4 cents lower with
December at $6.405 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices soared in hectic trading on the eve of
meetings by two OPEC committees that are expected to focus on the
cartel's rampant overproduction.
   Hopes of an agreement to rein in production sparked frantic
buying, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 78 cents to 84 cents
higher with November at $15.40 a barrel; heating oil was 1.18 cents
to 1.64 cents higher with November at 43.85 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1 cent to 2.14 cents higher with November at
49.06 cents a gallon.
   Wheat and soybean futures, bolstered by a spurt in export
activity, settled modestly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade
while corn and oat futures finished mostly lower.
   The Agriculture Department said after the close that Egypt had
purchased 250,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices
and the Philippines had purchased 35,000 metric tons of subsidized
wheat. Exporters said China had bought 170,000 metric tons of
wheat, also at prices subsidized under an Agriculture Department
program to boost exports.
   Taiwan was said to have purchased 27,000 metric tons of U.S.
soybeans at market prices and was expected to bid for another
54,000 metric tons Wednesday night.
   Wheat settled 2} cents to 4 cents higher with December at $4.26}
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1{ cents lower with December at
$2.90} a bushel; oats were 2 cents lower to } cent higher with
December at $2.58\ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 6 cents higher
with November at $8.06{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures ended higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
ahead of Friday's quarterly USDA cattle-on-feed report from the
Agriculture Department. The report is expected to show a reduction
in the number of cattle being fattened for slaughter due to
record-high marketings and significantly fewer placements.
   Pork futures were mostly lower in line with weaker cash markets.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .30 cent higher with October at
72.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher
with October at 81.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .33 cent lower
to .18 cent higher with October at 39.57 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .13 cent to .82 cent lower with February at 48.37
cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures settled moderately lower on the Chicago
Merc, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index finished 2.40 points lower at 278.80.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Head Is Skeptical About Circuit Breakers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Crash Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly approved circuit breakers designed to halt
trading if stock prices take a sudden plunge could actually provoke
a frenzied sell-off as investors rush to beat the deadline, the
president of the American Stock Exchange said Wednesday.
   Speaking on the first anniversary of the October stock crash,
Amex President Kenneth R. Leibler said circuit breakers are ``the
most visible change'' that has been made to prevent a repeat of the
crash.
   But he said their effect is uncertain.
   ``There is a school of thought that says that as the market
moves toward (the circuit breaker), investors may rush to get out
knowing that the market's going to close, and it may even
exacerbate the trend,'' Leibler said during a news conference.
   ``There is no experience with this in the markets, and I don't
think there is any guarantee that this will be productive,'' he
added.
   Leibler, in Boston to address an executive symposium, said he
believed Wall Street and the U.S. government must go further,
addressing ``larger structural issues'' and not just the
``mechanical or technical causes'' of the crash.
   The circuit breaker plan was approved Tuesday as a one-year
experiment by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. If the Dow Jones average of
30 industrial stocks drops 250 points in a single day, trading on
the major U.S. exchanges will automatically be halted for one hour.
   If there is an additional 150-point plunge, for a total of 400
points in a single day, a second circuit breaker will impose a
two-hour halt.
   Leibling said the American Stock Exchange will cooperate with
the plan, which is intended to provide ``a cooling-off period''
during a panic like the one that hit Wall Street on Oct. 19, 1987,
when the Dow Jones average fell 508 points.
   He also said he thought the chances of another crash are slight,
because ``the market appears to be quite reasonably valued by
historic standards and in relation to corporate profits.''
   But he said additional steps are needed to win back the
confidence of small investors.
   ``I think instead of focusing so much on the symptoms, which is
trying to eliminate or change rules about particular products, I
think we have to focus on the infrastructure, which is to continue
to invest at the exchanges in greater technology to be able to
handle greater activity,'' he said.
   In addition, Leibler said, there are steps that should be taken
in Washington.
   ``The situation that we currently have today _ where the markets
are all independently regulated, where the futures markets and the
securities markets are regulated by two entities, who in turn are
overseen by two different congressional committees _ I think that
long term places us at a severe disadvantage with other world
markets, and I think it is a very, very inefficient system and a
potential cause for instability,'' he said.

   The Boeing Co. on Wednesday released a photo of a
secret unmanned airplane it said made its first flight Sunday.
   Boeing released few details about the experimental aircraft,
other than to say it successfully completed its first flight and
would undergo further flight tests ``to characterize the
capabilities of this type of vehicle.''
   The airplane has a long, skinny fuselage with narrow, flexible
wings. It is powered by two propeller-driven engines, described by
the trade publication Aviation Week and Space Technology as
Teledyne Continental liquid-cooled piston engines.
   In April 1986, a similar plane was photographed outside a hanger
at the Grant County Airport in Moses Lake, in central Washington.
Boeing declined to comment on that aircraft.
   Boeing said the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had
expressed interest in the aircraft and has provided some money to
participate in flight evaluation. The agency has classified certain
aspects of the aircraft design and performance, Boeing said.
   The plane resembles Boeing's Compass Cope remotely piloted
vehicle, an unmanned aircraft powered by a single jet engine.
Boeing built two of the planes for the Air Force.
   The Compass Cope was 40 feet long with a 90-foot wingspan. It
made its first flight at Edwards Air Force Base in California in
July 1973.

<HEAD>House Passes `Bork Bill' Guaranteeing Video Privacy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday passed legislation
designed to protect the privacy of video store customers, an
outgrowth of last year's hearings on the nomination of Robert Bork
to the Supreme Court.
   The Video Privacy Protection Act was approved by voice vote and
sent to President Reagan.
   The measure, which cleared the Senate last week, was written
after a weekly Washington, D.C., newspaper obtained and published
the video rental records of Bork, whose nomination was the subject
of a lengthy and bitter battle in the Senate.
   Bork and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was
conducting the nomination hearing, expressed outrage at what they
said was a violation of Bork's privacy.
   The legislation was drawn up by four Judiciary Committee
members, Democrats Paul Simon of Illinois and Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, and Republicans Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Charles
Grassley of Iowa.
   Under the measure, video stores would be prohibited from
releasing information about any customer's rentals or purchases of
video tapes, unless they have the permission of the customer.
   Janlori Goldman, staff attorney of the American Civil Liberties
Union's Privacy and Technology Project, said ``the movies one views
in the privacy of one's home reveal personal information which
should be afforded legal protection.
   ``The legislation establishes an important precedent for our
continuing efforts to pass legislation expanding privacy safeguards
for personal information such as medical, insurance and personnel
records.''
   Bork's nomination was defeated by the full Senate, 58-42, in
October 1987.

   Consolidated Rail Corp. on Wednesday
reported a 34 percent rise in third-quarter profit from a year
earlier, attributing the increase to improved volume and cost
control.
   The freight company, which was sold by the government in March
1987, said its net income in the third quarter jumped to $83
million, or $1.21 a share, from $62 million, or 90 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to $876 million from $800 million.
   ``Our performance this quarter reflects our continuing ability
to control costs while attracting significantly increased
business,'' Chairman L. Stanley Crane said.
   ``While we expect freight traffic to remain strong in the fourth
quarter, we do not expect the same percentage increases in traffic
over the prior year, since the fourth quarter of 1987 reflected
substantial increases in coal and steel traffic,'' he said.
   Freight traffic in the third quarter increased 7.3 percent over
a year earlier, Conrail said.
   In the first nine months of the year, Conrail's net income rose
to $228 million, or $3.31 a share, from $220 million, or $3.20 a
share.
   Nine-month revenue increased to $2.59 billion from $2.41 billion.

   The Pentagon on Wednesday suspended the
Sundstrand Corp. from doing business with the government, saying it
wasn't satisfied with the company's response to being caught up in
a huge defense fraud case.
   Sundstrand, which last week agreed to pay $115 million in the
largest single fraud settlement in history, has been barred
indefinitely ``from government contracting and government-approved
subcontracting,'' a Pentagon statement said.
   Defense officials has not been convinced that ``corrective
actions undertaken thus far have been adequate ...,'' it added.
   The contracting suspension applies to the parent corporation as
well as six subsidiaries _ Sundstrand Data Control Inc.; Falk
Corp., Sundstrand Heat Transfer Inc.; Sundstrand Service Corp.;
Sullair Corp. and Signatron Inc.
   The suspension was imposed by the Defense Logistics Agency but
applies to all government agencies, the Pentagon said. It does not
affect existing contracts already held by Sundstrand, which is
based in Rockford, Ill.
   ``This action is based upon information that Sundstrand
submitted false claims to the Department of Defense and conspired
to defraud the federal government,'' the Pentagon said.
   Sundstrand spokesman Claude Vernam said the suspension was not
unexpected, saying, ``We've known it was always a possibility.''
   Vernam said he could not estimate the value of the contracts
Sundstrand would lose as a result of the suspension nor the value
of the company's existing contracts with the government.
   But Sundstrand said in a statement it had implemented a program
to ensure compliance with requirements for doing business with the
federal government and was working with the Defense Logistics
Agency ``to ensure that they have confidence in the company's
present responsiblity as a government contractor.''
   Larry J. Wilson, a spokesman for the Defense Logistics Agency,
said he could not estimate how long the suspension might last nor
could he predict the immediate financial impact on Sundstrand.
   Wilson said there were at least two contracts pending for which
Sundstrand was bidding _ one worth roughly $800,000 at the Defense
Industrial Supply Center in Philadelphia and another worth about $3
million at the Defense Construction Supply Center in Columbus, Ohio.
   Sundstrand, a manufacturer of electronic, mechanical and
hydraulic systems for aircraft, agreed on Oct. 12 agreed to pay
$115 million to the government and to plead guilty to four counts
of defrauding the Defense Department by overbilling on aircraft
parts.
   At the same time, its Sundstrand Data Control subsidiary settled
a separate case by agreeing to pay $13 million. That case involved
charges the company had used unallowable costs to inflate its
overhead rates.
   The U.S. attorney in Chicago, Anton Valukas, said a federal
investigation had determined that besides overbilling for aircraft
parts, the company had been submitting claims for such things as
babysitting expenses, country clubs and servants for its executives.
   The company also was attempting ``to improve (its) ability to
market hardware to the Defense Department by giving gratuities to
Defense Department personnel and their spouses while concealing
(their) identity,'' the government said.
   Sundstrand employees gave an estimated $100,000 worth of liquor,
meals, motel rooms, golf outings and tickets to the theater,
hockey, football and baseball games, the government said. They then
submitted expense reports identifying the Defense Department
workers they entertained only as a ``customer'' or ``government
employee,'' the complaint said.
   The Defense Department accounts for 42 percent of Sundstrand's
$1.4 billion in annual sales, and Sundstrand acknowledged last week
it might face a suspension or debarment after the Pentagon reviewed
the matter.
   ``While representatives of Sundstrand have been engaged in an
active dialogue with officials of the Defense Logistics Agency
concerning these matters, corrective actions undertaken thus far
have not been adequate to convince DLA that the company is a
suitable business partner for the government,'' the Pentagon said
Wednesday.
   ``Accordingly, the suspension action has been taken to protect
the government's business interests as discussions with the company
continue.''
   Federal prosecutors have said they hope to complete a grand jury
investigation of the company and its executives by January. Under
Pentagon contracting regulations, however, a suspension might not
last that long.
   The Defense Department normally considers a variety of factors
in levying suspensions, including such things as whether the
contractor has paid back the government; whether executives
involved in a fraud have been dismissed, and what the company is
doing to prevent recurrances of misconduct.
   The Pentagon also can modify and narrow suspension orders to
focus on certain parts or subsidiaries of a corporation rather than
the entire concern.

<HEAD>Investigation Of Alleged Insider Trading Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors Wednesday searched the headquarters of
two companies linked to an insider trading scandal involving some
of Japan's top leaders, officials said.
   Investigators from the Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office also
searched the home of Hiroshi Matsubara, chief aide to the former
president of the two companies: Recruit-Cosmos, a real estate firm,
and its parent Recruit Co.
   Officials from the prosecutor's office confirmed the searches
had been made, but refused further comment.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said Wednesday night investigators
had removed more than 1,000 boxes of financial records and other
documents from the Recruit headquarters in Tokyo's Ginza district.
   The searches and investigation were expected to have a strong
impact on deliberations in Japan's parliament on a key tax reform
package.
   On Tuesday, opposition parties boycotted committee hearings on
the proposed tax measures, demanding witnesses be called to testify
on the growing insider trading scandal and its connection to top
politicians.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa and other officials have admitted their aides bought
shares in Recruit-Cosmos before they were offered to the public and
made large profits after the stock began trading on the
over-the-counter market and jumped in value.
   Last month, Yanosuke Narazaki, a member of parliament from the
opposition United Social Democratic Party, filed a complaint with
the prosecutor's office charging Matsubara had offered him bribes
of 5 million yen ($39,000) to end his investigation into the case.
   Recruit officials have maintained Matsubara acted alone in
offering money to Narazaki, but government investigators suspect
there was an organized attempt by Recruit to stifle a parliamentary
probe, news reports said.
   The searches Wednesday were in response to Narazaki's complaint,
the reports said.
   In a reference to the Watergate scandal that resulted in the
resignation of President Richard Nixon, Narazaki welcomed the
prosecutor's actions Wednesday and said they had ``opened up the
`gate' of the `Recruit-gate' scandal.''
   Ruling Liberal Democratic Party leaders met Wednesday to discuss
how to respond to opposition demands for the summoning of witnesses
to a parliamentary probe of the scandal, but did not agree on how
to proceed, the broadcasting corporation, or NHK, reported. The
party had hoped to begin formal debate on the tax bills by next
week.
   The insider trading scandal surfaced last summer when it was
disclosed that dozens of unidentified politicians, business leaders
and journalists had acquired and resold shares in Recruit-Cosmos.
   Last week, the Japan Communist Party released a list of nine
people, including Miyazawa and aides to other key political
leaders, who it said had purchased shares in the company.
   On Tuesday, Miyazawa apologized for having failed to properly
supervise an aide who he said had allowed a friend to buy 10,000
shares of stock in Miyazawa's name. But Miyazawa denied previous
knowledge of the dealings.
   The government has said the Recruit-Cosmos purchases were legal,
but opposition parties charge they were unethical.
   Trading stocks on privileged information has been a common
practice in Japan, but new laws passed since the scandal unfolded
deal more stringently with insider trading.

   CSX Corp. set the price on 40 million
shares of company stock it offered to buy back last month at $32 a
share.
   The offer was overscribed when it expired Tuesday at midnight,
the company said Wednesday.
   As part of a major restructuring, CSX offered on Sept. 19 to buy
back shares in a ``Dutch auction.'' Stockholders were offered a
price between $28 and $33 per share under the understanding that
the company would set the price once the offer expired.
   The company set a limit of 40 million shares, or 26 percent of
its outstanding common stock. CSX said shares tendered but not
purchased would be returned promptly. The company also said it
would buy back another 20 million shares of common stock, for a
total of 38 percent of the outstanding stock, over time on the open
market.
   According to analysts, reducing the number of shares outstanding
will increase the return to those who continue to hold stock. CSX
stock has been lagging about 25 percent below its pre-October 1987
price, disappointing many institutional stockholders.
   As part of its restructuring plan, the company is selling off
several non-transportation divisions and has offered early
retirement programs to numerous classes of employees.
   Hays T. Watkins, CSX chairman and chief executive officer, has
said the restructuring ``evidences our continued commitment to
increasing stockholder value by concentrating our resources on our
core transportation businesses.''

   The Teamsters union, facing rank-and-file
resistance to its major contracts, on Wednesday abolished a
decades-old requirement for a two-thirds membership vote to reject
tentative accords negotiated by its officers, union sources said.
   The change in the union's constitution allowing for a simple
majority _ any ``no'' vote greater than 50 percent _ to reject a
proposed contract was approved by the Teamster's 18-member
executive board, meeting in Greenelefe, Fla., the sources said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   The issue had been a major bone of contention in several
contracts negotiated this year and in Boston Teamster leader
William McCarthy's upset victory over Secretary-Treasurer Weldon
Mathis in claiming the union's presidency last July following the
death of Jackie Presser.
   It also was the target of a suit filed last May in U.S. District
Court here against the union by a 10,000-member dissident faction,
Teamsters for a Democratic Union.
   Duke Zeller, a Teamster spokesman reached at Greenelefe, would
not confirm or deny any changes in the union's constitution, saying
McCarthy planned to meet with representatives from 750 locals in
Chicago later this month to ``talk about new directions in the
union.''
   However, sources at Greenelefe, at the union's headquarters here
and at some locals in the Midwest confirmed that the board had
voted to do away with the two-thirds membership vote requirement
for turning down a proposed contract.
   Ken Paff, an organizer for the Detroit-based dissident faction,
called Wednesday's decision a major victory, saying Teamster
leaders had agreed to the change as ``part of an attempt to work
out a settlement'' to the court suit.
   ``We have been fighting for this steadily for 12 years,'' Paff
said. ``They called us nuts and screwballs, but we finally have
majority rule in this union.''
   Paff said the change had nothing to do with another suit _ by
the Justice Department _ seeking to wrest control of the Teamsters
from its top officers on grounds they are influenced by organized
crime figures. That suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
last June, would empower a court-appointed trustee to run the union.
   ``The Feds have shown no interest in this; it's not a
racketeering issue,'' Paff said. ``There's no law there has to be
any membership vote on approving contracts.''
   TDU had sought at the union's last convention in 1986 to change
the Teamsters' constitution to require a majority rank-and-file
approval for any contract with a petition signed by 100 of the
1,800 delegates. It was soundly defeated.
   The issue came to a boil in May when 63.5 percent of voting
truck drivers and warehouse workers under the nationwide Master
Freight Agreement covering some 200,000 Teamsters voted against a
new three-year contract with the trucking industry.
   Mathis, then acting as the union's president while Presser was
hospitalized with brain and lung cancer, declared the contract
ratified, saying the two-thirds requirement for rejecting it had
not been met.
   McCarthy and several other Teamster leaders had actively
campaigned against signing the accord and had lobbied to reopen
negotiations with bargaining agents for trucking company owners.
   The trucking industry contract is one of several negotiated this
year that has failed to garner majority support in rank-and-file
ratification votes.
   Others include signed contracts with United Parcel Service,
rejected by 53 percent of the covered voting members, and Stroh
Brewery Co., rejected by 54 percent.
   A proposed contract covering some 20,000 Teamsters who drive
auto transport trucks was renegotiated after it was rejected by 72
percent on a first ratification vote. Results of a second
ratification vote are due Friday.
   The only major contract approved by a majority of affected
Teamster members this year was with Anheuser-Busch Cos. covering
some 9,000 brewery workers.
   Paff and the Teamster sources said the new language requiring
majority approval of new contracts covers both nationwide and
locally negotiated accords.
   However, they said it also includes a provision reverting to the
two-thirds rule if less than 50 percent of the affected members
return ballots in any ratification vote.

<TEXT>
   Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said Wednesday its third-quarter net
income from operations climbed 16.5 percent, while another
publishing and information services concern, McGraw-Hill Inc.,
posted a 12.1 percent profit rise.
   Dun & Bradstreet said its income from operations, net of income
taxes, rose to $134.8 million, or 72 cents a share, in the three
months ended Sept. 30, compared with $115.7 million, or 62 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 15.8 percent to $1.07 billion, from
$921 million.
   For the first nine months of 1988, net income from operations
rose 12.3 percent to to $375.9 million, or $2.01 per share, from
$334.6 million, or $1.80 per share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 13.3 percent to $3.13 billion, from
$2.77 billion a year ago.
   New York-based Dun & Bradstreet is the world's largest marketer
of business information and related services. Its businesses
include Nielsen Media Research, which compiles television ratings,
and Moody's Investors Service, which rates debt.
   McGraw-Hill, also based in New York, said it earned $58.8
million, or $1.21 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30,
compared with $52.4 million, or $1.03 a share, a year ago.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 3.5 percent to $471 million, from
$455 million a year earlier.
   For the first nine months, McGraw-Hill said its profit rose 13.6
percent to $130.5 million, or $2.69 a share, from $114.9 million,
or $2.26 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 4.6 percent to $1.31 billion, from $1.25
billion a year earlier.
   McGraw-Hill said operating profit for the quarter rose in its
information services and financial services companies, but fell in
publishing operations because of softness in some aspects of its
education group's operations and in the broadcasting unit.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. on Wednesday
reported a 4 percent drop in third-quarter profits despite a more
than $80 million rise in sales at the publishing-entertainment
conglomerate.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, the Orlando-based company
earned $60.4 million, or $1 a share, on sales of $625.6 million,
compared with earnings of $63.2 million, or $1.21 a share, on sales
of $543.1 million in the same period last year.
   HBJ, the nation's largest textbook publisher, also owns
insurance operations and theme parks, including Sea Worlds in
Orlando, San Diego, San Antonio, Texas and Aurora, Ohio.
   Some of the decline in earnings is linked to restructuring costs
to thwart a hostile takeover bid by Maxwell Communication Corp.
   Since mid-August, HBJ has laid off 10 percent of its parks
division staff, replaced or relocated a number of executives and
canceled advertising in key markets.
   For the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, HBJ lost $55 million
on sales of $1.4 billion, compared with a net loss of $17 million
on sales of $1.2 billion for the same period last year.
   The company earlier this month announced plans to raise $500
million from the sale of junk bonds and common stock. Executives
recently returned from meetings in Europe to tout the securities.
   ``They couldn't come out with this deal with a quarter that was
horrendous,'' said Elizabeth Bramwell, an analyst at Gabelli & Co.
in New York. ``You can't come out and sell stock when a quarter is
really disappointing financially.''

   A rebound in apartment construction offset a
decline in single-family home building, boosting overall housing
activity by a moderate 1.5 percent last month, the government said
Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.45 million units in
September, the fourth consecutive month that starts have held
steady between a rate of 1.43 million and 1.48 million units.
   ``We've had fairly stable interest rates and an economy that
continues to grow at a moderate pace. As a result, we have had
about the same rate of housing activity for the past four months,''
said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.
   Economists have been expecting significant drops in housing
activity this year as interest rates increased. But the sector has
held up somewhat better than anticipated.
   The Federal Reserve, as an inflation-fighting measure, began
pushing up interest rates in late March, but the rise has been
fairly gradual and in the last two month rates have declined
slightly.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgages hit a low of 9.84 percent in early spring,
climbed to 10.71 percent in mid-August and by last week eased to
10.33 percent.
   However, David Seiders, chief economist of the National
Association of Home Builders, said mortgage rates will begin
climbing again this year, dampening building activity.
   ``We're looking for rates to start going up again, not long
after election. We're looking for a percentage point increase from
now until the middle of next year,'' Seiders said.
   Housing construction during the current economic expansion
peaked at 1.81 million units in 1986, falling to 1.62 million units
last year.
   In the first nine months of this year, starts are running 10.5
percent behind the same period of last year, on track for about
1.45 million units by year end. Economists anticipate a further
decline next year.
   Building permits, a good indicator of future housing activity,
fell 4.4 percent in September to an annual rate of 1.40 million
units, after rising 3.1 percent in August.
   Single-family homes in September were built at an annual rate of
1.05 million units, down 2.3 percent from August.
   However, apartment construction shot up 13.2 percent to 403,000
units. In August, apartment construction had dipped 13.0 percent to
the lowest levels since the end of the last recession in 1982.
   Apartment construction swings widely from month to month.
Analysts say it has been depressed by high vacancy rates and the
elimination of tax benefits in January 1987.
   By region, housing starts shot up 12.4 percent in the West to
435,000 units, the highest since June 1987. Starts also increased
6.3 percent in the Midwest to 254,000 units and 3.9 percent in the
Northeast to 212,000. However, they fell 2.0 percent in the South
to 552,000.
   Seiders said builders are working overtime in California,
fearing the eventual imposition of growth limits by local
governments in crowded southern counties in the state. Activity in
the Northeast, despite the September increase, has been cooling
this year from an earlier boom, he said.
   Obrinsky said housing activity will likely pick up in
manufacturing areas of the Midwest, where the regional economy is
being powered by a surge in export sales. However, the summer
drought has hurt farming areas in the Midwest.
   Activity in the South has been hurt by high vacancy rates in
Texas and other oil-dependent states in the Southwest, he said.

<HEAD>Earnings Up 30 Pct. for Parent of Home Savings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H.F. Ahmanson & Co., the nation's largest
thrift holding company, Wednesday reported earnings in the third
quarter rose 30 percent over the year-ago period.
   Ahmanson, parent of Home Savings of America, said earnings for
the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to $56 million, or 57 cents per
share, compared with $43.4 million, or 44 cents a share, for the
same period in 1987.
   But earnings for the first nine months slipped 19 percent to
$135 million, or $1.37 per share, compared to $167 million, or
$1.70 a share, for the same period a year ago.
   The decline was attributed to a 74 percent reduction in
after-tax gains on loan sales.
   ``Core earnings _ which exclude gains from sales of loans _
increased by 69 percent from the third quarter of 1987 to nearly
$51 million, and accounted for 91 percent of total earnings,'' said
Ahmanson Chairman Richard Deihl.
   Additionally, net interest income rose 30 percent to a record
$228.2 million, he said.
   Ahmanson, with assets of $38 billion and net worth of $1.84
billion, is the parent company of Home Savings of America, the
nation's largest savings and loan and the largest residential
mortgage lender in the thrift industry.
   Home Savings operates 353 savings branches in nine states and
113 mortgage lending offices in 19 states. Its $29.4 billion
deposit base is the largest of any U.S. savings institution.
