   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Well-known Haitian sociologist
Laennec Hurbon reported that four men with Uzi submachine guns
sacked his home early Monday in a raid that he said was politically
motivated.
   Hurbon and his servant told The Associated Press that the
intruders, dressed entirely in black and wearing black caps, forced
Hurbon to open the gates of the house at 2 a.m. and threatened to
kill him if he resisted.
   They said the gunmen departed half an hour later with $1,300,
leaving the house in great disarray.
   Hurbon, 47, told the AP, ``What I find terrifying is that we are
dealing with persistent political banditry. They scattered my work
notes, and trampled on the books of my library. It is ominous for
the future of a country when civil liberties are violated. In this
case, an intellectual was singled out. What next?''
   The sociologist is on an official mission to study religious
movements in the Caribbean. Hurbon, research director in sociology
at the Center For Scientific Research in Paris, is the author of
standard works in French on voodoo and Haitian culture.
   The incident was the second recent instance of violence in the
Haitian capital following the military overthrow of President
Leslie Manigat's civilian government on June 19-20.
   Last Thursday night, the house of Appeals Court Judge Ely
Legagneur was the target of a drive-by shooting. Legagneur said in
an interview broadcast over radio Haiti-Inter on Monday that he was
``not involved in politics'' and believed the gunmen had mistaken
their target.
   Over the weekend, rumors spread across the capital that Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, who led the coup which overthrew Manigat and then
declared himself president, had died of a heart attack.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
AP Sunday that Namphy had been seen that afternoon on the edge of
his swimming pool.
   Namphy has a record of heart illness.

   Storms soaked eastern Texas, Louisiana and Georgia on Monday,
lightning blacked out a Colorado mountain city, and temperatures
soared in Michigan and South Dakota.
   Rain showers and occasional thunderstorms reached from western
South Carolina and Georgia across eastern Texas and southeast
Oklahoma. Showers and thunderstorms also developed in the Dakotas,
southern Montana, northern Wyoming and northwest Colorado, as well
as northwest New Mexico.
   Lightning strikes caused a power outage affecting much of Craig,
Colo.
   In Monroe, La., 3.75 inches of rain fell between 5 and 7 p.m.
The hard, dry ground didn't absorb the water, which rose fast and
flooded streets. Several central Louisiana towns got an inch or
more of rain Monday night.
   Thunderstorms produced 2\ inches of rain between North Houston
and Humble, Texas, and about 1{ inches in western and northwest
Harris County, Texas.
   Other heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1{ inches at Macon, Ga., and almost one-half inch at
McAllen and Longview, Texas.
   At least three Michigan cities reached high temperature records
for July 4 by early afternoon, with a record-tying 88 degrees in
Alpena, and record-breaking 92 in Flint and 90 in Marquette.
   South Dakota also sweltered through the holiday, with Rapid City
and Aberdeen setting records for the date with 105 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at San Simeon, Calif., to 102 degrees at Yuma, Ariz. The
nation's low Monday morning was 38 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The national weather forecast for Tuesday called for showers and
thunderstorms from Florida across Alabama, southern Mississippi and
Louisiana and from northern Montana across the northern Pacific
Coast.
   High temperatures should be in the upper 80s and the 90s over
the Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the eastern Gulf, much of the
Ohio, Tennessee Mississippi and Missouri valleys, the Plains, the
lower Rockies, Nevada and the southern Plateau. Highs in the 60s
and 70s were forecast along much of the Pacific Coast. Temperatures
in the Southwest's deserts could reach 115 degrees. High
temperatures over the rest of the nation were generally predicted
to reach the 80s.

<TEXT>
   Q: How come?
   Q: _ civilian aircraft, to be outside of its normal air
corridors in that part of the world.
   A: I don't know that I can answer that question. It seems to me
that two things are pretty clear. First of all, flying in that kind
of constrained environment that you would be very careful,
particularly given the warnings and the NOTAMs we had issued. And,
secondly, I don't understand the responsibilty of a country that,
while it is attacking other ships, making a war zone out of a
certain area of the ocean and then goes ahead and flies a
commercial airliner over that part of the ocean at the time that
attacks and hostilities are under way.
   Q: Was there anything else unusual in terms of speed or altitude
of this aircraft, other than it did not respond and that hey were
out of their normal flight corridors.
   A: As I said at the conclusion of my statement, not all the data
is in, but we do have indications that the people on the ship were
led to believe, from the flow of information _ and we are
reconstructing this now _ that the aircraft was not only on steady
bearing and closing, but that it had gone up in altitude and was
increasing _ or decreasing in altitude as it neared the ship.
   Q: What was the altitude ....
   A: At what point.
   Q: The point at which the attack was commenced.
   A: Well, it was somewhere between 9,000 _ and I think the
missile was at about 7,000 feet, somewhere in _
   Q: (Inaudible) thousand feet. Is the attack _
   A: Again, I'm qualifying this, because we're having to
reconstruct and draw out all that data from the AEGIS system.
   Q: Did you say that the speed _
   A: It's not easy to do.
   Q: _ the speed of the aircraft was 450 knots. Is the attack
speed of the F-14 not somewhat higher than that.
   A: It could be. The F-14 _ there were indications that as he got
closer his speed was increasing. But not dramatically, just
increasing.
   Q: Are there any indications that the Iranians are now heading
up to take some further action or some response in addition _ in
response to this.
   A: There was an attack this afternoon, after this morning's
incident, on a _ I believe it was a Norwegian _ Norwegian ship.
Further south, not in the vicinity of this event.
   Q: Were there any AWACS, either Saudia Arabian _ or did we have
AWACS off our carrier in the Indian Ocean supporting the _
   A: No, there was not. No, there was no air cover, there was no _
either an E-2 or an AWACS in the vicinity.
   Q: Why was that?
   A: Because we were not escorting an Earnest Will mission. These
ships were returning from a convoy, coming through by themselves,
through the Strait, and we just don't use our cover for that.
   Q: ... _ heightened state of alert since they permanently
deployed the Silk Worms, ... anticipated Fourth of July attack?
   A: But we were anticipating units that wouldn't require that. In
any event, there was not.
   Q: Admiral, what did we do to find survivors, and what is it
doing to search for the black box?
   A: The wreckage, if, in fact, there is wreckage, is inside of
Iranian territorial waters. They are conducting a SAR search in
there. We are not in there. We've gone pretty close to try and
follow events, what they are doing. But no, we are not in the
vicinity of the wreckage.
   Q: How far out of the corridor --
   Q: -- F-14s operating out of Bandar Abbas -- They operated
tandem with the F-4s. Can you tell us whether there were any other
Iranian aircraft of any description in the area?
   A: There was an F-4 up later. Whether it had been up all the
time or earlier we're not able to determine.
   Q: Was there a way to avoid these --
   Q How much later?
   A: Well, a few minutes, I don't know exactly, but it did not
come out -- it didn't go feet wet, and it didn't play a part in
this.
   Q: Have you determined what precipitated the first attack?
   A: This is sort of a simplistic chart. We're trying to keep it
simple. The incident this morning, when it all started, was in this
are. This is the ... Vincennes. Their helicopter was fired on in
this vicinity, and about in that same area, in this direction,
somewhere ... the aircraft was impacted about here. The Iranians
are reporting the wreckage in this vicinity, and that is ...
southwest or, rather, southeast of Qishum Island. And we're still
in the vicinity there trying to follow those events. The -- this is
the commercial air route -- and the attack this afternoon was in
this area.

<HEAD>His Ship's Come In: Trump Shows Off His Yacht</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald and Ivana Trump, proud new owners of an
opulent yacht, gave the press a pre-party peek at their nearly
300-foot ``jewel of the sea.''
   ``This is the ultimate in boats and I feel strongly that this
country should have it,'' Trump said with Fourth of July spirit
Monday.
   The Trump Princess, with its six decks, 210 telephones and crew
of 31, is ``the jewel of the sea,'' he said.
   The original owner, Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, got into
financial trouble and borrowed a lot of money from the Sultan of
Brunei, with the yacht as collateral. When Khashoggi defaulted, the
sultan decided to sell it.
   Trump, who picked up the ship at the fire sale price of $30
million, also saved money by registering it outside the United
States under a flag of convenience.
   A Bahamian flag flies from the stern, but Trump noted that ``the
American flag is right on top.''
   But the Stars and Stripes was a notch below the Trump insignia
on the mast.
   As liveried servants made preparations for the Trumps' inaugural
party, a Fourth of July bash for 100 close friends, photographers
snapped pictures of the luxurious fittings.
   ``Everything that looks like gold, is gold,'' said yacht manager
Jonathan Beckett. ``Everything that looks like suede, is suede.''
   Heavy-set guards, distinguished by their black suits, Trump
insignia lapel pins and walkie talkies, made sure reporters and
photographers didn't sit on the silk, feather-stuffed couches or
lean on the creamy leather bar rails, or set equipment on the
gleaming marble tabletops. One reporter was ejected for lighting a
cigarette.
   The Trumps said they bought the boat, sight unseen, for fun.
   ``It's different from a building,'' Trump said. ``We're getting
tired of buildings.'' He said they would use the yacht for
business, pleasure and charity fund raisers.
   ``We're going to have a lot of fun with it,'' Mrs. Trump said.
``We're going to watch the fireworks and celebrate the Fourth of
July. It's what America is all about.''
   ``You can get used to it,'' she said, her eyes sweeping the onyx
vases stuffed with lilies and orchids.
   Apparently the lavish yacht, refitted for $10 million, does take
some getting used to.
   Beckett said the first night he spent aboard as he brushed his
teeth, ``I looked down into that gold-plated basin and thought `I
can't possibly spit in that.' But that was two years ago. You learn
to live with it.''
   For nearly an hour, the Trumps obliged the press, giving tours
and answering questions.
   ``What does this tell you?'' Mrs. Trump was asked.
   ``Dreams can come true,'' she said.
   Her husband disagreed. ``It really tells her, you have to have a
smart husband,'' Trump said.

<TEXT>
   Rose Phillipine Duchesne, a French-born nun
who worked among American Indians and founded the U.S. branch of
the Society of the Sacred Heart, has become a saint of the Roman
Catholic Church.
   Pope John Paul II called Phillipine a ``great pioneer'' as he
canonized her Sunday in a solemn ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica.
   He also proclaimed a Spanish member of the Trinitarian order,
the Rev. Simon de Rojas, among those Catholics who through their
life and works are officially recognized by the Church as being in
heaven and worthy of honor.
   Born into a prominent French family in 1769, Philippine was in
her 30s when she joined the Order of the Society of the Sacred
Heart, founded by St. Madeleine Sophie Barat in 1800 to educate
young women.
   She became the society's first missionary. In 1818, she and four
other nuns traveled to Missouri, where they founded several
schools, including what the Society says was the first free school
for the poor in the United States.
   From the Midwest, the order spread to the East and West Coast
and later to Canada, Cuba, Mexico and New Zealand.
   The society now has 5,500 members who are involved in education,
spiritual guidance and pastoral work in 40 countries, including
Japan, Uganda, India, and Korea and throughout Europe, North
America and South America.
   In his homily during the canonization Mass, John Paul, speaking
in English, praised Philippine's missionary courage and held her up
as a reminder that ``the call to holiness is universal and does not
know the boundaries of nation, political system, culture or race.''
   When she was 72, Philippine fulfilled her dream to work with the
Indians when she founded the Sugar Creek mission among the
Potawatomi tribe in Kansas.
   After only a year, illness and old age forced her back to the
convent in St. Charles, Mo., where she died in 1852. But in the
short time she spent with them, the Indians were so impressed by
the time she spent on her knees that they called her
Quah-Kah-ka-Num _ The Woman Who Always Prays.
   More than 7,OOO nuns, alumnae and students of the Society of the
Sacred Heart were at Sunday's ceremony, concelebrated by eight
bishops and cardinals including the archbishop of St. Louis, John
L. May. Among them was a family of Potowatomi Indians headed by
Gerald Tuckwin, who is dean of liberal arts at Haskell Indian
Junior College in Lawrence, Kan.
   Since the Second Vatican Council, the society, while maintaining
its dedication to the education of young women, has devoted much of
its energy to work among the underprivileged.
   Speaking to the 20,000 pilgrims gathered in the basilica for the
canonization, the pope recalled Philippine Duchesne's ``radical
commitment'' to the poor and said it should be ``a living
inspiration to the society and to all religious of today.''
   De Rojas, born in 1552, devoted his life to work among the poor
and to promoting devotion to the Virgin Mary, as well as being
confessor to the Spanish royal family. He died in 1624.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet diplomat denounced as
inhumane East Germany's policy of having border guards ``shoot to
kill'' people who try to flee to the West, a radio station reported.
   It appeared to be the first time a Soviet official has publicly
criticized communist East Germany for its long-standing policy of
shooting anyone trying to escape to West Germany.
   Yuri Akvilyanov, second secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Bonn,
said nations have every right to protect their borders, West German
radio reported on Sunday.
   ``But as far as these shootings go _ in these times, that seems
inhumane,'' the radio quoted him as saying.
   ``I don't believe what occurs on the (German-German) border is a
result of orders from Moscow,'' he reportedly said.
   He also said ``the situation on the (German-German) border must
become much safer'' if relations between the two states are to
improve, the radio reported.
   Akvilyanov made the remarks Saturday night in an address to West
German university students in Bonn, the radio said.
   There have been no reports of East Germans being killed in
attempts to escape to the West this year.
   But in Berlin alone, according to West Berlin police, 59 people
have been shot to death trying to escape over the Berlin Wall since
the communists erected it in 1961 and effectively slowed the flood
of refugees to the West.
   East German border guards reportedly fired at a 31-year-old man
who climbed the Berlin Wall on April 19, but he escaped to West
Berlin unharmed. The West German government condemned the incident.

   A computer program designed to sabotage a Texas
computer company destroyed information stored on personal computers
at NASA and other government agencies, according to The New York
Times.
   It was not known whether the program had been deliberately
introduced at the agencies or brought in accidentally, but NASA
officials have asked the FBI to enter the case, the Times reported
in Monday's editions.
   Damage to government data was limited, but files were destroyed,
projects delayed and hundreds of hours spent tracking the
electronic culprit, according to the newspaper.
   The rogue program destroyed files over a five-month period
beginning in January at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Sentencing
Commission, the Times reported.
   The program, known as a ``virus,'' infected close to 100
computers at NASA facilities in Washington, Maryland and Florida,
NASA officials said.
   David Lavery, a senior computer systems scientist with NASA,
said loss of information was isolated and limited to personal
computers.
   The virus was designed to sabotage computer programs at
Electronic Data Systems, a private company in Dallas, said Bill
Wright, a company spokesman. The program did little damage, he said.
   It is one of at least 40 programs in this country designed to
conceal their presence and replicate themselves into computer
memory banks, experts told the Times.
   The virus programs often lie dormant before exploding at a
particular time or on contact with a specific computer program.

<HEAD>Cardinal Appeals To Traditionalists To Stay Loyal To Rome</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 2 grafs to RESTORE time element. Picks up 3rd
graf, `On Thursday ...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger said Mass in Latin at
Notre Dame Cathedral on Sunday and appealed to traditionalist
followers of rebel Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre to stay loyal to the
Roman Catholic Church.
   Lustiger, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Paris, performed the
traditional Mass as part of an effort to persuade Lefebvre's
followers not to join the renegade archbishop in breaking with the
Vatican.
   On Thursday in Econe, Switzerland, Lefebvre consecrated four
bishops in defiance of Pope John Paul II and was excommunicated.
   Lefebvre contends the Vatican has broken with true Catholicism,
by adopting Mass in languages other than Latin and in taking other
modernist steps since the 1960s.
   Lustiger announced Thursday that Mass would be said in Latin in
three churches in Paris each Sunday, as part of an effort to woo
followers of the French-born Lefebvre, who has many supporters here.
   In his sermon, delivered in French before thousands of tourists
and worshippers in Notre Dame, the famous Gothic cathedral in
central Paris, Lustiger called on the faithful to remain in ``the
sole house of God.''
   ``One cannot pretend to belong to the Catholic church while
cutting oneself off from the college of apostles,'' Lustiger said.
   ``Follow the word of love of God which is within you,'' he said.
``You should stay within the Catholic house.''
   At the church of St. Nicolas du Chardonnet nearby in the Latin
Quarter, occupied illegally by traditionalist followers of Lefebvre
since 1977, there was no indication that Lustiger's appeal would be
well-received.
   Outside the church Sunday hundreds of traditionalists crowded
around a stand where photographs of Lefebvre consecrating the four
bishops were selling for $8 each, the French news agency Agence
France-Presse reported.
   ``In truth, there has been neither excommunication, nor
schism,'' the agency quoted one unidentified worshipper at St.
Nicolas du Chardonnet as saying Sunday. ``All that is
disinformation by journalists.''

   Flood waters, fierce winds and hail storms have
plagued China's central Sichuan province in recent days, killing
more than 50 people and injuring at least 1,000, according to an
official report.
   The violent weather also ruined crops, disrupted transportation
and wrecked tens of thousands of homes, the China News Service said
in a report appearing today in Hong Kong newspapers.
   Gaoxian in southern Sichuan, more than 1,000 miles southwest of
Beijing, was hit June 25 with storms that triggered mountain
torrents and rock-mud flows that cut roads and communications, the
report said.
   The storm destroyed about 140,000 homes and 62,600 acres of
crops in more than 1,100 villages in Gaoxian, the report said,
quoting flood prevention authorities in Sichuan.
   Ya'an, about 80 miles southwest of the provincial capital of
Chengdu, was hit hard by storms Friday evening, the report said.
More than 16,000 acres of crops were destroyed and major roads were
blocked including the one linking Sichuan to Tibet, it said.
   The news service said more than 40 people died and at least
1,000 were injured in Gaoxian, but did not say where the other
fatalities occurred.

<TEXT>
   Here is a text of President Reagan's statement
at Camp David, Md., Sunday on the U.S. destruction of an Iranian
airliner with 290 aboard in the Persian Gulf. The statement was
read from the White House by presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I am saddened to report that it appears that in a proper
defensive action by the USS Vincennes this morning in the Persian
Gulf an Iranian airliner was shot down over the Straight of Hormuz.
   This is a terrible human tragedy.
   Our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers, crew and
their families.
   We deeply regret any loss of life.
   The course of the Iranian civiliian airliner was such that it
was headed directly for the USS Vincennes, which was at the time
engaged with five Iranian Boghammer boats that had attacked our
forces.
   When the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings, the
Vincennes followed standing orders and widely publicized
procedures, firing to protect itself against possible attack.
   The only U.S. interest in the Persian Gulf is peace, and this
tragedy reinforces the need to achieve that goal with all possible
speed.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George Shultz crosses the
Pacific this week to visit nine capitals and hold major policy
talks including discussion of security at the Seoul Olympics.
   Shultz also is likely to be dogged by questions about Sunday's
U.S. missile attack on an unarmed Iranian passenger jet, which
immediately provoked comparisons to the Soviet downing of Korean
Air Lines flight 007 in 1983.
   Already on Shultz' agenda, before Sunday's incident, were issues
including the Olympics, Cambodia's future, American military bases
in the Philippines, Chinese missile exports, U.S. trade deficits
with newly prosperous Pacific nations, ``boat people'' refugees
from Vietnam and other problems lingering from the Indochina War.
   Shultz also expects to brief Asian officials on the Moscow
superpower summit and the West's economic summit at Toronto last
month.
   Shultz's two-week journey is scheduled to begin Tuesday and will
be his longest to East Asia as secretary of state. Meetings begin
Thursday in Bangkok, Thailand, with a three-day Pacific rim
ministerial summit of ASEAN, the Association of Asian Nations. Also
attending will be foreign ministers of their major trading partners
including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the
European Common Market.
   The secretary is scheduled to continue on to Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan
and the new Marshall Islands Republic.
   Talks on the future of Cambodia could dominate Shultz's Bangkok
and Beijing stops.
   ``We are in an evolving situation,'' said a senior U.S. official
who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. ``People on all
sides seem to want a political solution ... the Soviets, Vietnam,
ASEAN, Prince Sihanouk, ourselves.''
   In Bangkok, Shultz is expected to meet Cambodian Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, who is supported by ASEAN and ``should emerge as head of
state'' of an independent Cambodia, said the U.S. official.
   Recent announcements of a partial end of the 10-year Vietnamese
occupation of Cambodia have focused U.S. and ASEAN attention on
whether Cambodia could be taken over again by the Khmer Rouge,
blamed for the deaths of millions of Cambodians.
   The United States has been emphasizing that a Cambodian
settlement must include not only a complete Vietnamese pullout but
also guarantees against return of the Khmer Rouge.
   U.S. relations with China ``are basically pretty good,'' the
official said, but Shultz will stress to the Chinese, main
supporters of the Khmer Rouge, that return of the Cambodian group
is unacceptable.
   The State Department has declined to comment on a published
report that the Chinese have offered asylum to Khmer Rouge leader
Pol Pot to remove him from Cambodia while confirming that Beijing
has indicated support for non-Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia.
   Shultz also will again voice U.S. concern about a reported flow
of Chinese missiles to ``hot spots'' in the Middle East and Persian
Gulf war, the U.S. source said. Such weapons threaten stability in
various parts of the world and ``we will make it very plain this is
something ... all countries have to be worried about, including
China,'' he said.
   In addition to discussing prospects for successful and
trouble-free Olympic Summer Games in Seoul, Shultz expects to make
a major speech there July 18 on expanding democracy and human
rights in South Korea.
   U.S. use of Philippine military bases will probably be aired
with other ASEAN countries interested in the U.S. presence in
Southeast Asia as well as the Philippines, the U.S. official said.
Also to be discussed in Manila are plans for multilateral aid to
President Corazon Aquino's government.
   In Bangkok, Shultz will urge ASEAN countries against cutting
back on providing Vietnamese refugees ``first asylum'' pending
arrangements to transfer them elsewhere, the U.S. official said.
The United States on its part will continue doing what it can to
help an increasing flow of ``boat people,'' including ``absorbing
as many as we can into our country,'' he said.
   The United States took in 32,000 Indochinese refugees last year
and hopes to take 29,500 this year, he said.

<HEAD>Even With Sophisticated Gear, Aircraft Identification Can Be
Difficult</HEAD>

   The USS Vincennes, which mistakenly shot down
an Iranian civilian jetliner, is stuffed full of electronic
wizardry that one admiral once called ``Star Wars at sea.''
   But the Pentagon says even with such sophisticated gear, it is
difficult for the ship's crew to identify approaching aircraft _
especially a head-on target _ from the radar blip.
   ``It has not solved all of our problems and it does not defy the
laws of physics,'' Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said Sunday of the Aegis system of radars, computers and
weapons carried by the cruiser.
   The Pentagon has called Aegis ``the most capable
surface-launched missile systems the Navy has ever put to sea.''
   The system was designed to protect a naval task force, of about
10 vessels, from the increasing threat posed by the type of
anti-ship missiles which have already taken a heavy toll in the
Persian Gulf.
   The Aegis system uses ``phased array radar'' to simultaneously
track scores of planes and targets at ranges up to 2,000 miles and
destroy them up to 300 miles away. It can launch, track and target
up to 80 of the surface-to-air missiles it carries.
   Phased array radar emits a constant stream of radio signals and
uses computers to assemble a comprehensive and constant picture
from the electronic echo, unlike earlier radars, which rotated and
showed periodic blips that were much harder to track and analyze.
   Aboard the Vincennes, officers watch banks of video and computer
displays of the naval battlefield, and can fire Harpoon and
Standard anti-ship and anti-air missiles, heavier Tomahawk cruise
missiles, two 5-inch guns, and two Phalanx close-in, rapid-fire
guns for use against anti-ship missiles.
   Crowe, who briefed reporters after Sunday's shooting down of an
Iran Air jetliner, said the crew ``had about four minutes from the
time they picked up this target until it was declared hostile.''
   With the aircraft approaching at 450 knots, he said, time
presented ``a severe constraint'' in making an identification.
   ``One of the most difficult problems is from a radar blip,
particularly from a head-on target, to identify the type of
aircraft,'' Crowe said.
   The cruiser is equipped with gear to intercept and interpret
electronic emissions, such as radar or radio, identify the aircraft
or ships most likely to emit such signals, correlate that with data
from its own radar, and determine the likely identify of a target.
   Crowe told reporters that ``there were electronic indications on
Vincennes that led it to believe that the aircraft was an F-14,'' a
U.S.-made fighter that is the most lethal aircraft Iran owns.
   Crowe cited only ``electronic information which is classified
and I am not willing to discuss,'' but the indicators could have
included radio signals to or from the plane or nearby ground
stations, or emissions from the aircraft.
   U.S. warplanes, and many commercial aircraft travelling in war
zones, send out signals to prevent mistaken identity.
   Most aircraft also monitor standard military or civilian radio
frequencies. The Vincennes, said Crowe, warned the Iranian airplane
``on the civilian air distress net(work) three times in these few
minutes, and four times on the military air distress net.''
   ``We received no answers, nor did he vary course, nor did he
indicate in his conduct that he had received our communications,''
said Crowe.
   Following the attack by an Iraqi fighter against the USS Stark
in the gulf last year, said Crowe, the Navy adopted more aggressive
defensive tactics, and last September ``issued a Notice to Airmen,
NOTAM, which advised all aircraft in the Persian Gulf region that
U.S. Navy ships were taking additional precautions and of the need
to identify themselves and to state intentions.''
   ``Additionally, they were advised that failure to respond to
requests for identification ... or warnings, and operating in a
threatening manner could place the aircraft at risk by U.S.
defensive measures,'' Crowe told reporters.
   An independent observer, Capt. Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's
Fighting Ships, said ``it is absolutely inevitable that mistakes in
classification are always going to be made.''
   ``If you remember the captain of the Stark, in exactly the
reciprocal case, was criticized heavily for failing to take
appropriate action early enough,'' said Sharpe in a telephone
interview from his home in Kingsley, England. ``Well, now here you
have a commanding officer who clearly has taken early action, and
will, of course, be criticized probably even more fiercely than was
the captain of the Stark.''
   The commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, Marine Corps
Gen. George B. Crist, told reporters last week he had stationed the
Vincennes at the mouth of the gulf to protect merchant shipping
against a battery of Iran's anti-ship Silkworm missiles. No
Silkworms were involved in the fighting on Sunday.
   The Vincennes has a speed in excess of 30 knots, is 563 feet
long, displaces 9,600 tons fully loaded, and can carry two
helicopters for reconnaissance.

   Discovery moved into the glare of
spotlights early Monday on its long-awaited trip to the launch pad
and a giant step toward America's first space shuttle flight since
the Challenger tragedy.
   A flag-waving Fourth of July crowd of several hundred space
workers cheered as the 85-ton spaceship edged out of an assembly
building at 12:50 a.m., riding upright on the broad back of a giant
tracked transporter called a crawler.
   The 4.2-mile journey to Launch Pad 39B was scheduled to take six
to seven hours. Attached to Discovery were a 154-foot-tall external
fuel tank and the two 149-foot solid fuel booster rockets that will
hurl the craft into space on a flight scheduled for early September.
   As the rollout began, Kennedy Space Center director Forrest S.
McCartney presented astronaut Dave Hilmers, one of Discovery's five
assigned crew members, with an autograph book containing the names
of 15,240 engineers, technicians, managers, secretaries, clerical
workers and other center employees who have labored to return the
shuttle fleet to flight.
   The astronauts will carry the book into orbit with them.
   McCartney, Hilmers and other NASA officials watched the rollout
from a flag-bedecked grandstand outside the assembly building.
   The early morning move was planned to avoid thunderstorms and
lighting which are common during the day this time of the year.
   Center officials originally said all five of Discovery's
astronauts and NASA administrator James C. Fletcher would be here
for the rollout. But four of the crew members elected to spend the
holiday weekend with their families in Houston, and Fletcher's
office said Friday he couldn't make it.
   The failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed
Challenger 73 seconds after it lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986. All
seven crew members perished in the massive explosion.
   Since then the booster has been significantly redesigned and
tested and hundreds of other modifications have been made to the
shuttle main engines and other systems.
   Once at the pad, Discovery will be readied for a critical July
24 test of modifications to the three main liquid-fuel engines.
With the spaceship bolted firmly to its launch mounts, the power
plant will be ignited for 19.4 seconds at the end of a practice
countdown.
   The following day, one final pre-flight test-firing of a
redesigned booster rocket is planned at the Morton Thiokol plant in
Utah. Both tests must be passed before Discovery is certified for
flight.
   On Sunday, a test of an intentionally damaged version of the
shuttle rocket's redesigned joint was apparently successful, Morton
Thiokol said. The test was conducted at a plant near Brigham City,
Utah.
   ``It appears no gas leaked outside the joint, in spite of the
very severe intentional flaws,'' said Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.
``That has really raised our confidence for the (full-scale) test
at the end of the month.''
   The 1 p.m. MDT test was performed on a simulator that uses three
shortened rocket cases, two joints and 385 pounds of propellant to
mimic pressures present during when a full-scale rocket motor is
fired.
   Last week, NASA announced that it had changed the liftoff date
from late August to early September because it was taking longer
than expected to prepare Discovery for flight.
   Hilmers and four other veteran shuttle pilots will be at the
controls when Discovery blasts off to mark what NASA is counting on
to revive America's manned space program. The others are Commander
Rick Hauck, Dick Covey, Mike Lounge and George Nelson.
   During their four-day mission, the astronauts will deploy a
communications satellite, conduct scientific and technical
experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter systems.

   An unappreciative listener once doused him
with cold water, Al Capone bought him drinks and people played his
records on jukeboxes coast to coast.
   Glenn Howard doesn't sing in barbershop quartets anymore, but at
86, he's got a lifetime of fond memories in four-part harmony.
   Howard plans to be on the lead float Saturday in a San Antonio,
Texas, parade marking the 50th anniversary of the Society for the
Preservation of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America.
   The central Illinois man has attended all 50 of the
organization's conventions, from the first in Tulsa, Okla., in 1939
to this year's in San Antonio.
   ``I have to stand up every year and say I made it again,''
chuckled Howard, who began singing on street corners around 1920.
``But this year will be the biggie as far as I'm concerned.''
   Many of the society's 38,000 members, including some from other
countries, are attending the convention, which features a
competition to pick the best quartet.
   The groups have names like Rural Route Four, Most Happy Fellows
and Side Street Ramblers. Popular songs include ``When Irish Eyes
Are Smiling,'' ``You're A Grand Old Flag,'' and ``In The Shade Of
The Old Apple Tree.''
   ``The music reflects wholesome values _ something people are
holding onto,'' said society President Jim Warner of Memphis, Tenn.
``Interest is not waning; when people know there is going to be a
barbershop show, the response is tremendous.''
   The uniquely American style of music, featuring four
unaccompanied male voices, sometimes in a small-town barbershop
setting, gained popularity late in the 19th century and flourished
during the vaudeville era.
   A 1910 song written for these popular quartets gave the music
its name: ``Mr. Jefferson Lord, Play That Barbershop Chord.''
   Glenn Howard was a just a boy then, growing up in central
Illinois. He enjoyed listening to a quartet that performed on the
streets, and one day, when the bass didn't show up, his singing
career began.
   ``We did it all by ear,'' Howard recalled. ``If a group came
through town, we'd sit through all their shows and learn _ and
steal their harmony.''
   Howard sang with many quartets through the years, performing on
street corners, at county fairs, in theaters, on radio shows, and
at the Illinois State Fair.
   One late-night street concert apparently woke someone up.
   ``We had water thrown down on us from upstairs _ seemed like
five gallons,'' Howard recalled.
   After a radio broadcast in Chicago, Howard's quartet and another
group went to a tavern and continued singing. Someone at the bar
enjoyed it and sent a round of drinks after each song. Later,
Howard asked who it was.
   ``Al Capone!'' said Howard. ``Luckily, he liked us.''
   Howard worked for a baking company and a paint-by-number
producer, and farmed. But, often he also performed three or four
times a week.
   A group he sang with, the Capital City Four, recorded the first
album of barbershop quartet music for the society in 1939,
featuring songs like ``Sweet Adeline,'' and ``Dear Old Girl.'' It
gained national success.
   ``We could go into most any restaurant across the United States,
put a nickel in the jukebox and hear ourselves sing,'' said Howard,
holding the 78 rpm records from the album.
   Howard said he decided to quit singing when he throat started
tightening up about 15 years ago. But he remains a dedicated
student of barbershop music.
   Some young singers want to ``pep things up and forget about the
original tempo,'' said Howard, but at least they stick with many of
the old songs. ``If you're going to perpetuate something, that's
the way to do it.''

   This city of the rich and famous
held a cozy neighborhood bash Sunday, celebrating its 75th birthday
with an extravaganza rivaling those of the Olympics or the Super
Bowl.
   Jimmy Stewart, Scott Baio and Dinah Shore were among 1,000
singers, dancers and actors who offered a musical tribute, topped
by the unveiling of a diamond-encrusted slice of birthday cake
valued at $20 million.
   About 10,000 people watched the show at the Beverly Hills High
School football field. Donations from the event were to benefit 11
charities.
   Radio personality Casey Kasem led a 75-second countdown to the
show's start, which exploded in fireworks and the release of 1,000
balloons, including some shaped like silver-and-white birthday
candles.
   ``Happy Birthday, Beverly Hills,'' said Miss Shore, who emceed
the event. ``We have the best of everything here, the best schools
... the best hotels and the best restaurants. I'm glad I raised my
children here.''
   The 90-minute show featured skits, music and dancing
commemorating the city's historical highlights, such as the
turn-of-the-century discovery of oil.
   Desi Arnaz Jr. led 100 dancers and mariachi musicians in a nod
to the city's Mexican past.
   A dance tribute to the Beverly Hills Hotel featured Gene Barry
and Barbara Eden, who were joined by waiters, housekeepers and
other hotel employees.
   The sequence ended with a stream of celebrities, including
Stewart, Robert Stack and Dick Van Patten, who were escorted
onstage. Models decked in $20 million worth of jewelry portrayed
affluent hotel-goers, disembarking from $5 million worth of antique
cars on a 100-foot-long stage
   Motorcycle police, escorted by an armored car, drove onto the
stage for the presentation of a piece of birthday cake frosted with
2,600 white diamonds.
   ``Our birthday cake is so special you can only order it by the
slice,'' Miss Shore said.
   All the performers, including the University of Southern
Californa marching band, crowded onstage for a fireworks-laden
finale.
   Earlier, local chefs contributed a 1{-ton, 300-square-foot
birthday cake for this 5.6-square-mile city that has more tourists
than Disneyland, more doctors than most medical centers and more
money in its banks than any city except New York.
   The town was incorporated in 1914, two years after developer
Burton Green built a pink and green hotel on a lima bean field here.
   Ever since, Green's Beverly Hills Hotel has been the focal point
of the city's celebrity social life. Satirist Will Rogers was
inaugurated as the city's first honorary mayor there in 1923 and
many a mega-deal was consumated in its Polo Lounge.
   Among the other famous sights in the town is Pickfair, the
legendary home in the 1920s of Douglas Fairbanks and ``America's
Sweetheart,'' Mary Pickford, which has since been owned by Los
Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss and, most recently,
multimillionaire businessman Meshulam Riklis and his singer-wife,
Pia Zadora.
   The celebration is to climax Labor Day weekend 1989 when a grand
finale brings together the world's top fashion designers in what is
billed as the world's largest fashion show. More than 1,000 models
will promenade a 2{-block runway down Rodeo Drive.

<HEAD>Justice Department Says New Prisons Cheaper Than Early Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says it is ultimately
cheaper to relieve overcrowding in penal facilities by building new
prisons and jails than by releasing repeat offenders.
   A report released Sunday by the department's National Institute
of Justice concluded that new crimes committed by released
prisoners cost society about $430,000 a year through such things as
police and court work, losses to victims and private security
expenses.
   But it costs about $25,000 for each prisoner each year to build
a new cell and maintain the inmate, the study said.
   ``Confinement is not too expensive when weighed against the
price of crimes that would otherwise be prevented by
incapacitation,'' said James K. Stewart, the institute's director.
   The report was based on a study of 2,190 inmates from
California, Texas and Michigan who were repeat offenders and given
early release. The study found those inmates committed an average
of 187 crimes a year.
   ``Public debate has mistakenly focused on the cost of
imprisonment compared with the cost of probation,'' said Stewart.
   The institute said sentencing 1,000 additional offenders to
prison annually would have required about $25 million a year but
would have averted 187,000 felonies that cost society a total of
$430 million.
   One-half the 2,190 prisoners said they had committed fewer than
15 crimes a year. Twenty-five percent said they committed more than
135 crimes and 10 percent said they committed more than 600.
   The study concluded that the $8.6 billion cost of operating the
nation's prisons and jails in 1983 was just one-tenth the over-all
cost of crime to society.
   The study said the bill for other criminal justice programs such
as police, courts and probation ran about $25 billion in 1983. Also
included in the total costs of crime to society were $35 billion in
victim losses and $31 billion spent on private security to avert
crime.

   A man and woman intent on getting out of
their clothes and into the Guinness Book of World Records stripped
down to their underwear 432 times in a store window.
   Delane Balliot, 22, and Newcomb Munt, 28, started their
record-book quest Wednesday and didn't quit until 72 hours later
Saturday. As long as nobody breaks their record, they hope the 1989
Guinness book will list them as the first record holders for
consecutive stripping.
   ``My feet are twice the size of my shoes right now,'' Balliot
said Saturday as she took off her high heels. ``I want to go home,
take a shower, go to sleep for days.''
   The professional strippers were allowed to rest five minutes
every hour during their bump-and-grind-a-thon, but often danced
several straight hours to accumulate time for catnaps, a spokesman
said.
   Both Balliot and Munt work as strippers for a singing telegram
company.
   For establishing the record, their employer is giving each of
them $500, a new set of clothes and a free trip to either New York
or Hawaii.

   A lot of bull was tossed around at the
Wayne County Fairgrounds. Even politicians stood in line to throw
it _ which came as a surprise to no one.
   And it only cost $1 a chip.
   The dried cow dung, the product of some of the area's finest
Holsteins, were used for a cow chip throwing contest Saturday, part
of a weekend Fourth of July celebration.
   Wayne County Commissioner Mark Altier, acknowledged as one of
the county's best ``bull throwers,'' tossed his chip 75 feet, 8
inches down the track in front of the grandstand.
   ``I haven't thrown a cow chip since high school,'' Altier said
with a grin. He said he had not practiced for the special contest
for politicians. ``I went in cold.''
   Other throwers followed the directions provided by organizers,
including: ``Place a plastic glove over one hand. ... Bring arm
back as if to throw a boomerang. Cow chips will not return on their
own accord. Release chip and let fly.''
   Colleen Bower, a candidate for Wayne County clerk of courts,
slung her chip 50 feet, 1 inch for second place among
femalecontestants.
   Mrs. Bower reached deep into the pile of dung to select her
chip, which she tossed overhand. ``There's nothing underhanded
about my toss. I'm a clean politician,'' she joked.
   First place among women went to Kathryn Buffington, principal of
Wooster's Boys Village, a school for troubled youths. Mrs.
Buffington's toss traveled 63 feet, 6 inches.
   ``I've been working out,'' she said. ``My job got me ready for
this contest.''
   County commissioner candidate Miles Priest managed a 56-foot,
4-inch toss. ``The only practice I've had is stepping into one on
my farm,'' he said.

   A growing blight threatens to destroy the
nation's entire hazelnut crop, and experts here are trying to find
a way to control the plant disease.
   All of the United States' 20,000-ton hazelnut harvest comes from
Oregon's Willamette Valley, where favorable conditions enable
farmers to turn out hazelnuts, or filberts, prized worldwide for
their size and high quality.
   But eastern filbert blight _ once confined to the eastern United
States _ has taken hold here since its discovery in Washington in
1970 and is spreading in an ever-widening arch in the northern
Willamette Valley.
   The United States produces just 3 percent of the world's
hazelnut crop. Experts say the nation's share could grow if they
can develop a variety that shares the qualities of the current
filbert strains and is immune to the blight.
   The world's other major hazelnut producers are Turkey, Italy and
Spain, where the blight is unknown.
   Eastern filbert blight is endemic to North America's native
eastern hazelnut, and because it also attacks European varieties,
farmers have been unable to successfully grow hazelnuts east of the
Rocky Mountains.
   However, the European varieties prospered in the Pacific
Northwest, where the native western hazelnut is immune to the
blight, until the disease took hold among the European stock.
   The European varieties are preferred because they have desirable
commercial qualities lacking in the western variety, which grows
wild along fence rows and is known as hazel brush.
   Scientists are working to control the blight's spread until a
breeding program at Oregon State University produces a strain
immune to the disease, an accomplishment believed to be years away.
   ``We need a way to slow down the spread of the disease so we
still have an industry when the resistant strains become
available,'' said Shawn Mehlenbacher, an assistant professor at
Oregon State and director of the breeding program.
   The disease spreads when spores that develop on infected wood
are washed by the rain or blown by the wind to other plants.
   Hazelnuts in the wild grow like a bush, but growers prune the
bushes to make them grow from a single stem like a tree. To check
the spread of the blight, further pruning is used to remove
diseased parts of the trees. Infected wood is then burned.
   Growers also use a copper-based fungicide that kills spores.
   To find a permanent solution, researchers have begun seeking an
alternative to the Daviana variety of hazelnut, which is used as a
``pollinizer.''
   In a typical orchard, 89 percent of the plants will be of a
variety such as Barcelona and 11 percent Daviana, Mehlenbacher
said. The Daviana plants pollinate the Barcelona variety, which
cannot pollinate itself.
   But Daviana appears to be particularly susceptible to the
blight, Mehlenbacher said.
   As an alternative, research has focused on a variety known as
Gasaway, which is immune to the blight but has drawbacks, such as
poor kernel quality and a small nut.
   Distribution of offspring of four blight-resistant seedlings
bred from the Gasaway variety will begin in January, Mehlenbacher
said. Nurseries will graft these plants onto rootstock to produce
new plants that will be immune to the blight, Mehlenbacher said.
   The breeding program eventually will offer a replacement for the
Barcelona variety, probably a plant descended from the Gasaway
type, but that will take about 18 years.
   Additional sources of resistance are being sought in hybrids of
the western and European varieties, but those will take 25 years or
more to develop, Mehlenbacher said.
   Growers are confident alternatives will be found to protect the
industry, said Jay Nelson, chairman of Oregon's Filbert Commission.
   ``We'll conquer it,'' Nelson said. ``It'll just take us time.''

   Model Jerry Hall says boyfriend Mick Jagger is
helping her prepare for her stage debut as Cherie in ``Bus Stop,''
the role Marilyn Monroe made famous in the 1956 film.
   In the play, Cherie, a dim Southern chanteuse, falls for Bo, a
yearning yokel.
   Jagger is helping Hall learn her lines for the production, which
opens July 26 at Montclair (N.J.) State College's Theatre Fest, she
told People magazine.
   ``He's got the Southern accent down pretty good,'' the Texas
native said of the British-born Rolling Stones singer.
   Hall said she will have no problem playing a dimwit.
   ``I have years of experience acting dumb,'' she said. ``In
business when men act patronizing, you just smile and act dumb and
charming and you get a way with a lot,'' she said. ``But beneath
this peroxide-blond hair lies a smart brunette.''

   Maverick attorney Melvin Belli angrily
dismisses allegations by his wife that he beat her ``as absolutely
false.''
   ``I love women, I don't fight them,'' Belli said. ``I'm an
Italian. It's not our nature to beat up our wives.''
   Belli, commenting Sunday about his wife Lia's filing for legal
separation, said she has a reputation for making things up.
   ``It's a nasty, nasty thing,'' Belli, 80, said of the bitter
dispute. ``I think the people are sick of Lia Belli. I just want
out.''
   Mrs. Belli, 39, an unsuccessful state Senate candidate in 1984,
told reporters she wanted to end the marriage because her husband
was physically abusing her and falsely accused her of having
affairs with various celebrities.
   The famed ``King of Torts'' said he prefers to keep his private
life out of the press. But, he said, ``The only thing that I'm
really concerned about is this calumny that I beat her up. That's
absolutely false.''

   Author James A. Michener was greeted by a
brass band and community leaders as he returned to the southeast
Alaskan city where he wrote much of his latest novel, ``Alaska.''
   The 82-year-old novelist and his wife, Mari, arrived aboard a
cruise ship as they returned to the former capital of Russia's old
North American colony.
   The Micheners made their home in 1985 and 1987 in a log cabin on
the campus of Sheldon Jackson College.
   ``This is a very special place because we worked so long and
hard here,'' Michener said. ``We're delighted to see that log cabin
again.''
   The Micheners were to be grand marshals in the annual Sitka
Fourth of July parade today, and Sheldon Jackson College planned
``An Alaska Salute to James A. Michener'' with a fireworks display.
   The 19th century Presbyterian missionary for whom the college is
named is a major historical figure in ``Alaska.''
   ``Alaska,'' like many of Michener's novels, is a historical,
scientific story of Alaska beginning before mankind and including
events such as discovery by early Russian sailors, the 1867 sale to
the United States, gold rushes and construction of the Alaska
Highway.

   Actor Sean Penn has had another run-in with the

kick, police said.
   Penn was cited Sunday for criminal mischief by police officers
who happened by during the altercation between him and New York
Post photographer Paul Adao, said Sgt. Ed Burns.
   It was not known what ignited the dispute, Burns said.
   Lensmen have long aroused Penn's ire. Last year an argument
resulted in fisticuffs and landed Penn in a California jail.
   Last week, a television cameraman accused Penn of pinning him
against the wall of an elevator in Atlantic City, where Penn and
his wife, singer-actress Madonna, were attending the Michael

<HEAD>Blues Musician Eddie `Cleanhead' Vinson Dead At 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blues singer and alto saxophone player Eddie
``Cleanhead'' Vinson, who got his nickname came from his baldness
and his reputation for his blend of instrumentals with vocals, has
died of a heart attack. He was 70.
   Vinson, who had been suffering cancer of the esophagus and
entered California Medical Center in mid-June for treatment, died
Saturday, hospital officials and family members said.
   He sang with the Cootie Williams Orchestra in the 1940s, and was
best known for such songs as ``Cherry Red,'' ``Kidney Stew Blues,''
and ``Somebody's Got To Go.''
   He often joked about his bald head and even referred to it in
the lyrics of some of his songs, including ``Cleanhead Blues.''
   The son of musicians, Vinson was born Dec. 18, 1917, in Houston,
Texas. He sang in local church quartets as a youth and learned to
play saxophone in high school.
   He toured the South and Midwest with bands fronted by Chester
Boone and Milton Larkin from the mid- to late 1930s, and in 1940
toured with blues great Bill Broonzy.
   Vinson moved to New York City in 1942, where he joined the
Cootie Williams Orchestra. He recorded ``Cherry Red'' during a
three-year stint with the former Duke Ellington sideman.
   Vinson ``established himself as a powerful blues singer with a
personal, broken-toned style,'' according to jazz critic Leonard
Feather.
   After a brief stint in the Army near the end of World War II,
Vinson formed his own 16-piece orchestra and appeared with the Ink
Spots during an RKO-Keith circuit tour across the United States and
Canada. He recorded his second hit, ``Kidney Stew Blues,'' with his
band.
   He returned to Houston in 1954 to teach music. He made
occasional local club engagements.
   Vinson moved to Los Angeles more than 20 years ago after being
rediscovered by band leader and promoter Johnny Otis. He revived
his career with club engagements in the United States and Europe
and new albums, including ``Kidney Stew is Fine,'' ``Cleanhead's
Back in Town'' and ``You Can't Make Love Alone.''
   Vinson regularly returned to perform at European summer jazz
festivals, and made a series of appearances with Count Basie.
   Vinson is survived by his wife, Bernice; three daughters; five
grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
   A private funeral service was tentatively scheduled for Thursday.

   The Iran Air plane that the U.S. Navy
shot down in the Persian Gulf was one of 243 A300s built by Airbus
Industries and still in service with airlines worldwide, an Airbus
spokesman said.
   The wide-bodied A300 was the first aircraft put into service by
the European consortium in 1975 and is still the most widely used
Airbus plane.
   The Iran Air jet was an A300 B2 model delivered to the airline
in April 1982, said the manufacturer's director of communications,
Robert Alizart.
   It had recorded 11,448 hours in flight and 8,757 takeoffs and
landings, he said. The plane was one of six A300s Iran Air was
operating, all the B2 version.
   In different seating configurations, the A300's capacity can
range up to about 300 passengers. The A300 B2 has a range of about
2,500 miles.
   One of the newest Airbus aircraft, an Air France A320, crashed
June 26 while flying low over at an air show near Mulhouse in
eastern France, killing three people.
   The Airbus consortium is composed of companies from France, West
Germany, Britain and Spain.

   A man who lost 11 family members when a
U.S. warship blew an Iranian jetliner out of the sky was so upset
that he banged his head repeatedly against the walls of an Iran Air
office, a witness said.
   The man, who owns a supermarket in Dubai near the Iran Air
office, had eight children, his wife, her brother and his wife on
the plane.
   He was among dozens of people who crowded the office in Dubai on
Sunday, clamoring for information.
   ``The man just went out of his mind, going from pillar to post
and banging his head,'' said a witness reached by telephone in the
United Arab Emirates. ``He has lost his mind.''
   The witness, a shipping executive in the bustling port of Dubai,
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Iran said all 290 people aboard died when the plane crashed into
the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the Persian Gulf. The United
States said its Navy mistook the jet for an Iranian jet fighter.
   Airline sources said all but about 40 of the passengers on the
Iran Air Airbus A300 were Iranians.
   The Iranian man owns a supermarket called Hormuz, which is not
far from the Iran Air office, the witness said.
   He said the supermarket owner came in earlier Sunday morning to
deliver bottled water and soft drinks while the office was
monitoring the radio for news of the crash.
   ``Who would have thought that man was going to be in such grief
just a few hours later? I couldn't bear the sight,'' said the
executive.

<TEXT>
   When Mohammed Hamadi goes on
trial on charges of hijacking a TWA jetliner to Beirut, he will
face some of the 39 Americans he is charged with holding hostage
for 17 days.
   The trial for Hamadi, a Shiite Moslem charged with murder and
air piracy, begins Tuesday in a heavily fortified Frankfurt
courtroom.
   Navy diver Robert Stethem, of Waldorf, Md., was shot to death by
the hijackers.
   Several former hostages have been asked to testify about how
their abductors abused them. Dozens have given depositions to West
German prosecutors.
   ``I'm ready to go,'' said Kurt L. Carlson, a Chicago-area native
who said he was beaten by the hijackers for two consecutive hours.
   ``I feel strongly about what the hijackers did. All the beating
and the terror _ our lives were threatened every minute on that
plane,'' Carlson told The Associated Press.
   ``We're very much interested in seeing justice done,'' said
George Lazansky, of Algonquin, Ill.
   ``It's an ongoing story. It continues every day,'' he told the
AP.
   Lazansky's wife, Joanne, was also on TWA flight 847 when it was
hijacked by gunmen en route to Athens from Rome.
   West German court documents indicate that in addition to being
beaten, many passengers were threatened and robbed. Stethem was
shot in the head and his body thrown onto the tarmac at Beirut's
airport.
   Carlson and other former hostages said they were disappointed
that the trial was not being held in the United States, where
Hamadi could have faced the death penalty. Hamadi faces a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment in West Germany if the court convicts
him as an adult. Under West German law, an adult is 21 years old.
   Hamadi contends he was under 21 during the hijacking.
   West Germany last year refused a U.S. request to extradite
Hamadi to the United States. The decision angered U.S. officials
and caused weeks of tension between the two countries.
   The differences have since been patched up, and U.S. Justice
Department officials have been assisting West German investigators
and prosecutors in the case.
   Court spokesman Falk Thomas said eight Americans, including six
people who were on the hijacked airliner, have formally intervened
in the prosecution. That means attorneys for the eight can question
Hamadi during the trial.
   Two of the eight are relatives of Stethem, Thomas said.
   Thomas, a Frankfurt judge acting as spokesman for the Hamadi
trial, said Hamadi will be tried in a specially constructed
courtroom in Preungesheim prison, where he has been held since his
arrest.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987 after
a search revealed he was carrying liquid explosives.
   West German prosecutors later said his fingerprints matched
those of one of the TWA hijackers.
   Thomas said more than $7.5 million was spent constructing the
high- security courtroom. The defendant, judges and witnesses will
be separated from the public by bulletproof glass.
   After the trial opens, Thomas said a juvenile court will decide
whether Hamadi was 21 years old when the hijacking preparations
started.
   The West German indictment lists Hamadi's birthdate as June 13,
1964. Hamadi has claimed he was born in 1966.
   If the court tries him as an adult and convicts him, Hamadi
could receive life in prison, but if he is tried and convicted as a
juvenile, the maximum term would be 15 years. Under West German
law, a juvenile is less than 18.
   The court can also rule that Hamadi should be tried as an
adolescent, someone 18, 19, or 20 years old.
   If convicted as an adolescent, the court could sentence Hamadi
either as an adult or a juvenile, depending on how mature it
decides he was at the time of the hijacking.
   Thomas said actual testimony on the murder and air piracy
charges is scheduled to begin in September. He said the trial would
last at least three months.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas Ali Hamadi, was sentenced in April
by a Duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two
West Germans in Beirut in an attempt to gain freedom for his
brother.
   One of the hostages, Alfred Schmidt, was released in September.
Businessman Rudolf Cordes is still being held in Beirut.

<TEXT>
   A top official of the leftist National
Democratic Front coalition and parliamentary candidate in this
week's general election has been shot to death, law enforcement
officials said.
   Javier Ovando, the coalition's chief of electoral affairs and a
close associate of its presidential candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
was shot five times in the head late Saturday and found inside his
car at a downtown intersection, the attorney general's office said
Sunday.
   The coalition has mounted the strongest electoral challenge in
years to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
Voting is Wednesday.
   The attorney general's office said the body of a person who has
not been identified was also found in Ovando's car.
   Police said they had no suspects and would not speculate on a
motive. They said an investigation was under way.
   Cardenas and other leaders of the coalition planned to meet with
Interior Ministry officials today to demand a full investigation.
   Ovando had dropped off a Front coalition official and was
driving to his Mexico City home before he was killed. Police
discovered 22- and 38-caliber cartridge shells inside the vehicle.
   Ovando served as chairman of the PRI in Michoacan state when
Cardenas, then a PRI member, was state governor.
   Cardenas led a dissident reform movement within the PRI last
year before he left the party to mount his own presidential
candidacy.
   Recent polls have shown Cardenas finishing second in Wednesday's
elections behind PRI candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Since coming to power in 1929, the PRI has never lost a
presidential or gubernatorial race.
   Its members have often been accused by opponents of rigging
elections.

<TEXT>
   Episcopalians at the church's 69th General
Convention, saying it would take time to act on more difficult
issues such as homosexuality and the selection of female bishops,
focused on procedural matters.
   ``The real strain for the convention is that so many things
happen so fast in life today regarding justice and moral issues,''
Bishop Frederick Borsch of Los Angeles said Sunday. ``It's hard to
deal with them and find a way of speaking about them that is
helpful.''
   The denomination's governing bodies _ the House of Deputies and
the House of Bishops _ spent Sunday dealing with organizational
matters.
   The convention's Committee on Social and Urban Affairs will
debate homosexual and AIDS issues before those topics are sent back
to the two houses for general discussion. The committee debate is
scheduled to begin Tuesday.
   The General Convention meets every three years to set policy for
the 2.6 million-member church. The convention runs through July 11.
   Among the resolutions expected to come before the 3,000
delegates are a ban on discrimination against people with acquired
immune deficiency syndrome; a requirement that each of the church's
7,500 U.S. parishes adopt AIDS education programs; and funding for
those programs. The question of whether the church should recognize
single-sex ``marriages'' also will be discussed.
   Some bishops said they didn't think the delegates will resolve
much.
   ``The church is not clear on homosexuality and we have to wait
until it is clear before we can move on it,'' Bishop George L.
Reynolds of Tennessee said. ``It will take some time, years,
listening before people get a clear mind on it.''
   Another potentially divisive issue is the ordination of women
bishops, said Nancy Lawton, a lay delegate from Massachusetts.
There are no women bishops in the Episcopal Church, but one could
be elected within the next six months, she said.
   The consecration of a woman bishop would anger church's
conservative wing, and could cause a schism, said the Rev. Jerome
Politzer, president of the conservative Prayer-Book Society of the
Episcopal Church.
   About 10,000 worshipers began Sunday's activities by attending
Eucharistic services at Cobo Hall.
   During his sermon, Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning called
for unity.
   ``We need to take care of each other as we go forward, fully
conscious of the ambiguities and imperfections of all that we do,''
Browning said.
   On Saturday, Browning urged delegates not to let issues such as
marriage among homosexuals and the AIDS epidemic dominate the
meeting.

   Long before their forces shot down an
Iranian civilian jet over the Persian Gulf, U.S. Navy officers said
their constant fear was making a mistake in a war zone bustling
with civilian activity.
   Iran said all 290 people aboard the Iran Air jet were killed
Sunday when the U.S. guided missile cruiser Vincennes fired at it
during a routine flight from Iran to Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates.
   While not officially at war, U.S. sailors are in a combat
environment where ships remain at a high state of alert for weeks
on end and weapons are tested every few days.
   ``There are many threats out here, and maybe the worst one is
the possibility of somebody making a mistake,'' one ship's
commander said. ``In a confined area like the gulf, and with the
weapons on hand, the potential for disaster is incredible.''
   Navy personnel reacted with disbelief after servicemen aboard
the Vincennes, one of their most sophisticated warships, mistook an
Iranian civilian jet for a warplane and shot it down.
   ``Basically, they're beating their heads against the walls
trying to figure this out,'' said a source who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``Some people are even wondering the worst _ could
they (the Iranians) have done this on purpose?''
   The source said that in the high-tech command information center
of the Vincennes all indicators showed that the plane was an F-14
jet fighter that was descending on the ship from six to eight miles
out.
   The decision by the Vincennes' skipper, Capt. Will C. Rogers
III, to fire his SM-2 Standard anti-aircraft missiles was
ultimately based on one indicator, the IFF, or ``Identify Friend or
Foe,'' which tells radar operators what kind of aircraft is
approaching and what it appears to be doing.
   ``That plane did not answer calls on the radio and it was flying
an attack profile toward the Vincennes. The captain did what he
should have done under the circumstances,'' said the source.
   Rear Admiral R.G. Zeller, who returned to the United States on
Sunday from six months in the Persian Gulf, said U.S. sailors
constantly had to be on the lookout for civilian shipping and
aircraft.
   During a battle between U.S. and Iranian forces on April 18,
``commercial airliners continued to fly as though they were
oblivious to what was going on around them, and I think they
were,'' he said in an interview in San Diego. ``I don't think they
got the word. You have to be very, very careful.''
   ``It's not a war, in the sense that we think of wars where the
land and sky is filled with combatants,'' he said. ``It's a Third
World kind of thing where you have innocents and combatants and you
have to stay extremely careful.''
   The Vincennes is the first of the billion-dollar,
state-of-the-art ``Aegis'' cruisers assigned to duty in the gulf.
   The 9,600-ton, San Diego-based warship arrived in the gulf May
27 and has been assigned since then to anti-aircrart surveillance
patrol in the southern gulf, at the edge of the Strait of Hormuz.
   The ship's Aegis system is a computer-run ``phased array'' radar
system linked to the missile batteries. The ship, designed for
fleet air defense, can see vast distances with its radar and
conduct dozens of surveillance and firing missions simultaneously.
   U.S. officials have said the Vincennes' multiple task capability
could ease the burden on other ships serving in the gulf and give
the Navy a far more potent weapon that it has had in the waterway.
   From the American standpoint, concern about mistakes stems
mainly from the experience of the U.S. missile frigate Stark, which
lost 37 crew members and nearly sank after it was mistakenly
attacked by an Iraqi F-1 Mirage on May 17, 1987.
   U.S. officers and sailors say that while they don't dwell on the
Stark incident, it is never far from their minds and has led to
major changes in shipboard fire and damage control procedures that
are practiced on a regular basis.
   The U.S. force in the gulf region, known as the Joint Task Force
Middle East, is about 29 ships overall, including the carrier
Forrestal and its battle group in the Arabian Sea, and some 16
ships usually in the gulf.
   The gulf-based Middle East Force, part of the joint task force,
has been escorting 11 U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers since July last
year. It includes missile cruisers, missile frigates, destroyers,
an amphibious landing ship with 400 Marines on board, and six
minesweepers.
   Commander of both forces, aboard the flagship Coronado based at
Bahrain, is Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less.

<HEAD>ASEAN Foreign Ministers Optimistic About Peace In Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace is at hand in Cambodia with a new
dialogue between rebels and the Vietnam-backed government, Thai
Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda told Southeast Asian foreign
ministers today.
   Prem, opening the annual foreign minister's conference of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said negotiations on the
9-year-old war could lead to a new era of peace and prosperity in
Southeast Asia.
   The ministers echoed Prem's optimism and called on Vietnam to
halt the increased flow of ``boat people'' refugees to Southeast
Asian shores.
   ASEAN includes Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei,
Philippines and Singapore.
   Special U.N. Envoy Rafeeuddin Ahmed last week traveled to
Indochina to present a U.N. plan to end the Cambodian conflict to
leaders of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   ``Cambodia may be like Lebanon if there is no settlement,'' he
said at the ASEAN meeting today.
   An ASEAN delegate who saw a copy of the confidential U.N.
document said it would require major concessions by all sides,
including the dismantling of the pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia,
something Phnom Penh has rejected.
   ASEAN has been a major supporter of a three-party Cambodian
coalition fighting the Vietnamese. The rebel coaltion includes
Prince Norodom Sihanouk the leader of the coalition; the Khmer
Rouge; and the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation
Front.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 to topple the brutal Khmer
Rouge regime, which killed millions of people during its 1975-78
rule.
   The four warring sides have agreed to meet later this month in
Jakarta for informal talks.
   Hanoi last week began a partial pullout of 50,000 troops from
Cambodia and has pledged to work towards a political settlement and
a total withdrawal of its forces by 1990.
   Prem said Southeast Asia had been so burdened by the Cambodian
problem that it had lost a decade of possible economic cooperation.
   ``Let all concerned parties waste no more time,'' he said. ``The
opportunity for real peace in Kampuchea (Cambodia) and Southeast
Asia is at hand.''
   Prem said optimistic because the warring parties had agreed on
the need for a political settlement, the total withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops, national reconcilation among all Cambodian
parties, Cambodia's right to self-determination; and formation of a
neutral and independent nation that would pose no threat to its
neighbors.
   The ministers of Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia called for a
solution to the problem of Vietnamese refugees. Thailand's Siddhi
Savetsila urged that the U.N. secretary-general call an
international conference by early next year.

<TEXT>
   A South Korean contractor said today
it will stop building a gas refinery in Iran and evacuate all of
its 400 workers there after 12 workers were killed in an Iraqi air
raid.
   In addition to those killed, 45 Daelim Industrial Co. workers
were wounded Thursday in the Iraqi air raid on a gas refinery
construction site at Kangan, 560 miles south of Tehran.
   ``The evacuation is inevitable, because further trouble is
expected after the shooting down of an Iranian air jetliner by a
U.S. Navy ship,'' a Daelim official said on condition of anonymity.
   The official said Daelim workers, including the dead and
wounded, would be transported by two chartered Korean Air planes
later this week or early next week.
   Daelim, the official said, will stop building the gas refinery
until new arrangements have been made to ensure the safety of
workers on the site. The company was building the refinery under a
$180 million contract with Iran.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war for nearly 8 years and Iraq
frequently bombs industrial targets in Iran.

   One soldier was killed and two
policemen wounded when they fired on each other near the
presidential palace today, police said.
   Police said the shooting began when two officers in a patrol car
accosted three men ``acting suspiciously'' on a street corner about
500 yards from Malacanang Palace, the home of President Corazon
Aquino.
   The three men, who were in civilian clothes, pulled out pistols
and shot at the policemen, who fired back, investigators said. One
of the three was killed and two escaped.
   Police said the three were identified as members of an army unit
through papers found on the body of the slain soldier.

   The dollar today rose to its highest level in more
than seven months against the Japanese yen in slow trading. Stock
prices gained slightly.
   On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange market, the dollar rose 0.35 yen
above Friday's close to end the day at 134.85 yen. It was the
highest closing rate since last Nov. 24. when the U.S. currency
ended the day at 134.93.
   The dollar opened at 135.15 yen and traded between 134.60 yen
and 135.20 yen.
   Volume totaled $7.472 billion today, compared with $9.8 billion
last Friday.
   An official of the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the dollar rose in early trading because of tension
in the Middle East, where the U.S. Navy shot down an Iranian
jetliner on Sunday, killing all 290 people aboard.
   But the dollar eased back, mainly on profit-taking and
anticipation of the Fourth of July holiday in the United States, he
said.
   The official said the dollar would be affected by the move of
future oil prices.
   Traders said Japan's central bank did not intervene on behalf of
the yen, but news reports over the weekend said the bank has plans
to stem the dollar's climb if the currency's rise quickens.
   On the Tokyo stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, the market's main barometer, fell a slight 2.13
points, or 0.077, percent from Saturday's half-day session to close
at 27,360.39 points.
   Volume in the first section totaled 900 million shares.
   One trader said that ``the trend continues from Saturday,'' and
added that the market was likely continue on its present course as
long as the dollar and interest rates continue rising.
   ``You're not going to get any real buying until you see
stability in currency and bond markets,'' he said.

   Paias Wingti today became
the third prime minister in this nation's 13-year history to be
toppled by a no-confidence motion in parliament.
   After a weekend of intense lobbying, parliament deputies voted
58-50 to replace Wingti with opposition leader Rabbie Namaliu.
   Wingti, 36, led the People's Democratic Movement, which governed
in a coalition with the National Party.
   Namaliu, 39, took over leadership of the Pangu Pati (party) last
week. He represents Kokopo, an electorate on East New Britain in
the New Guinea islands.
   The new government of this nation north of Austrialia comprises
Namaliu's own Pangu Pati, the Melanesian alliance and several other
small factions formed mainly along tribal lines.
   Wingti blamed his downfall on a faction of the National Party
led by his long-time rival Paul Pora.
   Namaliu becomes Papua New Guinea's fourth prime minister since
it gained independence in 1975. The British Commonwealth nation had
formerly been administered by Australia.
   After today's vote, Namaliu was taken to the governor-general's
office to be sworn in. The parliament was adjourned until the new
government is ready to resume business.
   Papua New Guinea is one of the most primitive nations on earth.
About 89 percent of its 3.2 million people live in rural areas
without road access.

   The USS Vincennes, the Navy ship that
accidentally shot down an Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf,
was commissioned three years ago this week.
   The 9,600-ton cruiser is the fourth vessel to bear the name of
the southwestern Indiana city since 1826.
   The Vincennes, the third in a new class of guided missile
Aegis-type cruisers, was christened in Pascagoula, Miss., on April
14, 1984, by Marilyn Tucker Quayle, the wife of U.S. Sen. Dan
Quayle, R-Ind.
   It was commissioned at Pascagoula on July 6, 1985, and turned
over to the Navy by the builder, Litton Industries, in a ceremony
attended by members of Congress and Navy officials.
   At the time, Quayle said the ship would ``carry on the tradition
of service established by the three previous ships bearing the
name.''
   The first USS Vincennes was commissioned in 1826 and assigned to
service in the Pacific. It was decommissioned in 1867. The second
ship with that name was a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and
sunk by Japanese cruisers in 1942.
   A light cruiser named for Vincennes was commissioned in 1944 and
received six battle stars for service in World War II before being
decommissioned in 1946.

   Hundreds of Arab students threw rocks at
soldiers and blocked a main road in the occupied West Bank town of
Bethlehem today. The army responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets.
   The army said it will close all Palestinian schools in the West
Bank for three days starting Tuesday in an effort to limit student
participation in the nearly seven-month Arab uprising.
   In Jerusalem, police strengthened their forces after a riot in
the walled Old City on Sunday in which 15 Palestinians and several
Israeli police officers were injured. The protest began over an
Israeli archaeological dig near a site holy to Moslems and Jews.
   The disturbances were among the most violent since Dec. 8, when
Palestinians began their uprising against Israel's 21-year
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 215
Palestinians and four Israelis have died in the violence.
   Israeli officials view Arab schools as major centers of the
uprising. So in February, the army closed about 1,200 schools in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a move affecting about 475,000
students.
   Schools in Gaza have been operating on and off since, but 800
West Bank schools with 120,000 students stayed closed until the
army reopened them in a three-stage operation ending June 6.
   Brig. Gen Shaike Erez, head of Israel's military administration
in the West Bank, said reopening the schools had not quieted the
students.
   ``Instead of studies, there are disturbances,'' he said, adding
that he hoped the army decision would ``bring home to students and
parents that the current level of disturbances is unacceptable.''
   Erez said the closing was timed to coincide with a Palestine
Liberation Organization call to rename all Arab schools on Tuesday,
giving them more Palestinian, nationalistic names.
   In Bethlehem, five miles south of Jerusalem, hundreds of
students demonstrated on the main road today, hurling stones at
troops who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
   Officials at Beit Jalla Hospital said they treated dozens of
students for tear gas inhalation. The army said it was checking the
reports.
   An Associated Press reporter saw one Bethlehem school that was
renamed and had a sign ``Intefadeh,'' Arabic for ``uprising'',
apparently in compliance with a PLO leaflet.
   Police released new figures on unrest within Israel.
Commissioner David Krauss said more than 1,000 protests had
occurred in the last three months, including 730 in the Jerusalem
area.
   He said there were 51 firebomb attacks and blamed Arab
nationalists for 114 out of 210 cases of arson in forests and
pastures. He also said 900 Arabs had been arrested on a variety of
charges.
   Krauss said 55 of the detainees were suspected of arson and
investigations of more than 20 suspected arsonists would be soon be
completed.
   He said police found it difficult to operate in the occupied
territories after the PLO called for the resignation of Arab
officers, noting that only 300 policemen now remain in the occupied
lands out of the previous 850-strong force.
   Sunday's clash began when workers for the Ministry of Religious
Affairs started digging a hole on the Biblical Via Dolorosa, 30
yards from a gate leading to the Temple Mount.
   The Temple Mount, or Haram al Sharif in Arabic, houses the Dome
of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques and is the third holiest site in
Islam.
   Government archaeologist Dan Bahat said the dig was intended to
open a stairway giving access to an ancient tunnel running
alongside the Wailing Wall, Judaism's holiest site. The tunnel is
on the outside of the Temple Mount.
   Moslem religious leaders, using mosque loudspeakers, called on
Arabs to rush to the defense of the holy site and said they feared
the Israelis would dig a passage into the mosque area.
   Dozens of youths, some of them masked, darted out of the narrow,
twisting alleyways to throw rocks at police.
   The police rushed in reinforcements, closed off most of the
gates leading into the old city and blocked off some of the main
streets to keep more Arabs from joining the fray.
   They waged a two-hour running battle with the protesters, firing
tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. Police said seven
Arabs were arrested.
   An Arab girl about 6 years old was seen with her flower-print
dress covered with blood. Witnesses said she was hit by a rubber
bullet.
   The violence spread to other parts of Jerusalem. In one
incident, three passengers were injured when the bus they were
riding was hit by stones as it drove past an Arab neighborhood.

   Thunderstorms bore down on Montana today, pelting it with hail
and whipping up winds up 64 mph as much of the nation enjoyed mild
weather on the Fourth of July.
   Powerful thunderstorms were scattered across west central
Montana. The storms dropped hail an inch in diameter and generated
winds gusting to 53 mph in Helena late Sunday. In Great Falls,
winds roared up to 64 mph. Darby also got one-inch hail.
   Thunderstorms were widespread Sunday evening in the warm and
humid air of the Gulf Coast, but only isolated showers continued
into the morning.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from South Carolina to the Tennessee Valley and from Florida to
Louisiana; numerous showers and thunderstorms from Alabama to
Florida; widely scattered showers and thunderstorms from Texas to
southern Oklahoma, the Rocky Mountain states and northeast
California; and widely scattered showers through the Pacific
Northwest.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 80s or 90s across most of
the nation; around 100 degrees over western portions of the
northern and central Plains; over 110 degrees in parts of the
desert Southwest; and in the 60s and 70s in the Pacific Northwest
and along the California coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Olympia, Wash., to 95 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   An explosion and fire on a passenger train in
central China killed five people and injured 20, an official report
said today.
   The cause of last Friday's blast was not yet known, the
English-language China Daily said. Eleven of the injured were
reported in serious condition.
   The explosion occurred in a hard-seat carriage _ the kind in
which most Chinese travel because it is cheaper _ about eight
minutes after the train left Anyang in Henan province heading south
for Baoliansi.
   The car burst into flames that destroyed it and damaged two
adjoining cars before being extinguished about a half hour later,
the paper said.
   It was the fifth fatal train accident this year. A total of 169
people died in two train collisions, a derailment and a train fire.
   Railways Minister Ding Guangen was forced to resign in March to
take responsibility for the accidents, which were blamed on
negligence or poor enforcement of safety rules by rail workers.
   A fire in January that killed 34 people occurred when a spark
ignited paint thinner that a former train employee was carrying
illegally in a passenger car.
   After that accident, railway officials began examining baggage
more closely and televised warnings against carrying inflammable
material on trains.

   ``There's no way of rectifying this kind of situation, so all we
can do is remember these people,'' Toth said. ``Our prayers and
those of the commuity are with the ship's commander and crew
members.''
   The current Vincennes is the fourth ship to bear the name of
this southwestern Indiana city.
   ``I think our citizens are shocked and saddened about what has
happened,'' said Mayor William D. Rose. ``When you hear `USS
Vincennes,' you think of Vincennes, Indiana.''

<HEAD>Soviets Begin Inspections Under INF Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Teams of Soviet experts traveled to five missile sites in four
Western states to begin inspections mandated by the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   The 70 Soviets, who arrived Friday night at Travis Air Force
Base in northern California, departed in small groups Sunday for
two sites in Arizona, and one each in Utah, Colorado and Southern
California, said Travis spokesman Capt. Tom Dolney.
   A group of U.S. inspectors traveled to the Soviet Union at the
same time to begin their work under the treaty signed by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last December.
   Under the complex procedures outlined in the treaty, the Soviets
had the right to conduct spot checks at the five sites this
weekend, and they didn't have to say how many of them they wanted
to visit until the last minute.
   The Soviets, Dolney said, chose to send teams to all five sites:
   _The Pueblo Army Depot Activity in Pueblo, Colo.
   _A General Dynamics plant in San Diego.
   _The Dugway Proving Ground, a remote Army installation in the
western Utah desert.
   _A cruise missile testing and training site at Fort Huachuca,
Ariz., about 60 miles south of Tucson.
   _Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Ariz., a missile
training center.
   Teams also plan to visit several sites in the Eastern states,
but the Soviets have yet to announce those locations.
   The so-called ``baseline inspections'' verify information
provided during the treaty negotiations. The Soviets may spend up
to 24 hours at each site, U.S. officials said.
   At Dugway Proving Ground, where the cruise missile was test
fired, spokeswoman Kathy Whittaker said the 10 Soviets notified the
base of their impending visit about 2:30 a.m. MDT Sunday. They
arrived less than 3{ hours later, and completed their inspection
about 4:15 p.m., she said. Later, they headed for Travis.
   ``There's not much out there for them to see'' since the site
was stripped after the last cruise missile test firing, she said.
   Whittaker said the inspection not only fulfilled the
``baseline'' provision of the treaty, but also served as the
``close-out'' inspection to ascertain that activities banned under
the treaty have ceased.
   In San Diego, 10 inspectors arrived at General Dynamics Plant 19
to see what was once the Ground Launch Cruise Missile Launcher
Assembly and Program office. Those operations were discontinued in
December 1987, said Air Force Lt. Col. J.B. Kump.
   In Arizona, spokesmen at Davis-Monthan and Fort Huachuca said
the visits were extended from 24 to 32 hours by mutual consent.
Each base was visited by a team of 10 Soviets.
   In addition to the brief spot checks at the five sites, a group
of 22 Soviet on-site inspectors was welcomed Saturday to Salt Lake
City to begin its check at the Hercules Aerospace Co. missile plant
in Magna, Utah, where Pershing II missiles banned under the INF
Treaty were produced.
   The inspectors assigned to the Hercules plant will be the only
permanently based Soviets, who can stay for up to 13 years under
the treaty.
   The INF pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is
viewed as a trial for the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons
by 30 percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicated
verification procedures.

<HEAD>Founder Of Minute Maid Corp. Dead At 76</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FALMOUTH, Mass (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Stetson Morse, a former assistant
secretary of the Army and a scientist who oversaw the inventions of
frozen orange juice concentrate and other convenience foods, has
died. He was 76.
   Morse, who served in the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations,
died Friday at his summer home. He was a Wellesly, Mass., resident.
   Morse founded the National Research Corp., the Boston-based
industrial research organization, in 1940. In 1945, he established
the Minute Maid Corp., as a subsidiary of National Research. A year
later, Minute Maid began marketing frozen orange juice concentrate.
   The inventions Morse and his staff were credited with include
vacuum processes to powder drugs, coat optical lenses, dehydrate
food without losing taste or vitamins and refine metals without
impurites. National Research also helped develop instant coffee.
   After serving as a government adviser on chemical, biological
and radiological warfare for several years, Morse left National
Research in 1959 to become director of research and development for
the Army. His responsibilities were broadened in 1961 and he was
made an assistant secretary of the Army.
   After he left his assistant secretary post, Morse was named a
senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Alfred P. Sloan School of Management and served as a consultant for
the departments of Defense and Commerce.
   The Abington, Mass., native graduated from MIT in 1933. He also
did graduate work in physics at the University of Munich.
   Morse is survived by his wife, Marion, two sons and four
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Prosecutions Viewed As Weakening Mob Ruling Body</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Commission'' set up by the most
powerful mob families to settle their disputes appears to be out of
commission, authorities say.
   The latest example of the ruling group's declining power came
last week when authorities handed down indictments that indicated
rivalry between the nation's two most powerful mob families had
escalated into a plot to kill reputed mob boss John Gotti.
   ``I think you can say with some degree of certainty there is a
bankruptcy of leadership,'' says Fred Martens, director of the
Pennsylvania Crime Commission.
   The ruling body that generally stabilized the five major Mafia
families _ Genovese, Gambino, Lucchese, Bonanno and Colombo _ for
more than a half-century was effectively dismantled by the 1986
Commission trial.
   Three reputed bosses were convicted. A fourth, reputed Gambino
head Paul Castellano, was shot to death on a New York City street
about the same time.
   Experts say a new wave of prosecutions has thrown the underworld
into further disarray.
   Last month, two indictments against reputed top Genovese leaders
were returned by a Newark federal grand jury. Closing arguments are
scheduled next week in Newark in the federal trial of 20 alleged
Lucchese family members and associates, and a powerful member of
the DeCavalcante family, which operates mainly in New Jersey, is to
go on trial in Camden in September.
   ``There are some more organized crime indictments coming,'' said
U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.
   The Commission trial was a major source of disruption for
organized crime, experts say.
   With the Commission's end, the mob families lost a body to
settle disputes and handle business matters, said Ronald Goldstock,
director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force.
   The alleged plan to kill Gotti, reputed head of the Gambino
crime family, and his brother Gene was contained in an indictment
aimed at reputed New Jersey figures in the Genovese family.
   The indictment returned Tuesday charges racketeering, loan
sharking, illegal gambling and a labor payoff scheme. Seven other
reputed Genovese operatives were named in a second indictment.
   Gambino efforts to move into northern New Jersey led to the
murder plot, which state police Superintendent Col. Clinton L.
Pagano said is a ``very dramatic sign'' the Commission is not
operating.
   When the Commission was functioning, the Gambino family might
have sought permission for expansion plans and the Genovese family
might have tried to settle differences through the group instead of
through killing, Pagano said.
   He said the tussle focuses on the northern New Jersey gambling,
loan sharking and labor racketeering operations once controlled by
Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo, whose operatives hold sway in the
Atlantic City and Philadelphia areas.
   Scarfo's grip has been loosened by recent prosecutions and the
northern turf now is up for grabs, Pagano said.

   The Soviet Union and China today urged the U.S. Navy to get out
of the Persian Gulf after an American warship shot down an Iranian
jetliner with 290 people aboard. Governments around the world said
the attack underscores the need to end the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   Britain backed the United States' assertion that the Navy was
exercising its right to defend itself and that the U.S. warship
that fired on the Iran Air Airbus on Sunday had warned the airliner
to keep its distance.
   The United States said its forces mistook the jetliner for an
Iranian warplane during a confrontation with Iranian gunboats and
shot it down as it flew from Iran to Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates.
   Iran said everyone aboard was killed and vowed revenge.
   Gennady K. Zhuravlev, the Soviet ambassador to Egypt, said in
Cairo that the presence of U.S. and other Western military
``increases tension in the area and leads to incidents that are
hard to predict, such as the Iranian airliner incident.''
   Ever since U.S. warships were sent to the gulf last year to
protect Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack, the Soviet Union
has criticized the move as an effort to expand U.S. influence and
has said that it could further destabilize the area.
   It has called for an international force in the region to
protect shipping.
   Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Soviet
Union itself have warships and mine clearance units in and near the
gulf. The United States has deployed more than two dozen units in
the region, the largest single national contingent.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the involvement of the
superpowers in the Persian Gulf ``is not conducive to peace and
stability in the region.''
   ``We condemn this action and express our condolences for the
victims,'' it said. ``It is our hope that there will be a peaceful
settlement of the ... Iran-Iraq war at the earliest possible date.''
   China is officially neutral in the Iran-Iraq war. The United
States says China has sold Iran millions of dollars worth of arms,
including land-based Silkworm missiles, but China denies it.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said her government
deeply regretted the loss of life.
   But she added: ``We understand that in the course of an
engagement following an Iranian attack on the U.S. force, warnings
were given to an unidentified aircraft apparently closing with a
U.S. warship. We fully accept the right of forces engaged in such
hostilities to defend themselves.''
   She said the incident ``underlines the urgent need for an early
end to the Iran-Iraq conflict, including an end to all attacks on
shipping.''
   France said nations should work together ``to avoid a recurrence
of such events and to assure a settlement that could bring peace
and stability to this region of the world.''
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia today called the disaster
a case of mistaken identity and expressed sympathy for the victims
and their families.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry said, ``Japan hopes the incident will
not lead to the widening of tensions in the Persian Gulf and
appeals again for the necessity of an early peaceful solution to
the Iran-Iraq conflict.''
   Peter van Vliet, spokesman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry, said
the shooting was ``a very regrettable incident in a complicated
situation.''
   The Libyan official news agency JANA called the downing a
``disgraceful terrorist act.''
   JANA, in a broadcast monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp., also called for the withdrawal of all U.S. fleets and
military bases outside U.S. territory and territorial waters.
   Several British newspapers criticized the U.S. action.
   London's Independent said in an editorial that President Reagan
``appeared to deny the possibility that the attack had been
foolish, overly aggressive, an act of retaliation stemming from
recently changed rules of engagement or the result of panic and
inexperience.
   ``There was no hint of (American) concern that one of the most
advanced naval vessels in the world had somehow failed to identify
a civil Airbus.''
   The conservative London newspaper The Daily Telegraph said it
was ``an appalling mistake with possibly profound long-term
consequences for American policy in the Middle East and Iran's
relations with the West.
   ``Unfortunately for Britain and other European countries which
have naval patrols in the gulf, Tehran is unlikely to differentiate
between America and its allies,'' it said.
   In West Germany, the conservative Die Welt newspaper defended
the U.S. action, saying it resulted from the confused situation in
the war-torn Persian Gulf.
   ``No one can seriously make the accusation that this catastrophe
resulted from premeditation by the United States,'' the newspaper
said.

<HEAD>Rogue Computer Program Destroys Government Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer ``virsus'' destroyed information
stored in personal computers at NASA and other government agencies,
The New York Times reported today.
   The rogue computer program, designed to sabotage a private
company in Dallas, destroyed computer files over a five-month
period beginning in January, the newspaper said.
   Damage to government data was limited, but files were destroyed,
projects were delayed and hundreds of hours were spent tracking the
electronic culprit, the Times said.
   It was not known whether the program was deliberately introduced
or brought in accidentally, but National Aeronautics and Space
Administration officials have asked the FBI to investigate, the
paper said.
   Also affected were the Environmental Protection Agency, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S.
Sentencing Commission, the Times said.
   The program ``infected'' close to 100 computers at NASA
facilities in Washington, Maryland and Florida, NASA officials said.
   Viruses are computer programs that can lie dormant until they
are set off, wiping out files or having other effects. Some viruses
are not activated until a particular time or until another program
is run.
   The loss of information was isolated and limited to personal
computers, rather than larger mainframes, according to David
Lavery, a senior computer systems scientist with NASA.
   The virus was designed to sabotage computer programs at
Electronic Data Systems in Dallas, said company spokesman Bill
Wright. The program did little damage, he said.
   The Times said it was not known how the program spread from the
company to personal computers, but some government officials
suspect the virus was spread through informal networks of
government computer users who exchange publicly available software.
   The spread of the virus worsened when private contractors in
Washington and North Carolina inadvertently sold dozens of
computers carrying the virus to government agencies, the newspaper
said.
   Private computer consultants have warned that government
computer networks, inlcuding those with national security
functions, are vulnerable.
   ``I would hate to be an astronaut and have that virus expose
itself two years down the line,'' said a computer systems analyst
with the General Services Administration who requested anonymity.
The agency manages contracts for the government.

   The dollar was slightly higher in quiet European
trading today, but below the highs reached in the Far East
following the U.S. Navy's downing of a civilian Iranian airplane in
the Persian Gulf.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   The dollar rose in Asia following news the U.S. Navy mistakenly
shot down the plane Sunday, killing 290 people. Investors often
rally behind the dollar in times of international tension.
   ``The dollar was bought in early trading because of the Middle
East situation,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial
bank in Tokyo.
   But European dealers said the dollar-buying eased in early
European trading which gets underway as Tokyo's business day ends.
   Trading was unusually quiet because American banks and
businesses are closed for the Fourth of July holiday, they said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 134.85 after
profit-taking. Later, in London, it was quoted at 134.93 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8245 West German marks, up from 1.8213
   _1.5180 Swiss francs, up from 1.5130
   _6.1460 French francs, up from 6.1375
   _2.0540 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0530
   _1,353.50 Italian lire, up from 1,352.50
   _1.2235 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2190
   The British pound continued to fall in London to its lowest
level against the dollar since last September. One pound cost
$1.6890 today, cheaper than late Friday's $1.7023.
   Gold opened in London at a bid $438.70 a troy ounce, compared
with late Friday's $437. At midmorning Monday, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $437.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $437.10, down from $437.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.24 to close at a bid $439.64.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.74 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Friday's $6.74.

<HEAD>Report: Blimp Contract Competition Sparks Probes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI, as part of its probe of Pentagon
dealings, and the Securities and Exchange Commission are
investigating the competition between two groups for a Navy blimp
contract, The New York Times reported today.
   In 1986, the Navy decided to develop a model blimp that could be
used for radar surveillance, sparking feverish competition between
the Goodyear Aerospace Corp., a unit of the Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co., and a joint venture of the Westinghouse Electric Corp.
and Airship Industries, a British blimp maker.
   The two military contractors envisioned a potential $5 billion
project involving 48 airships, the Times said.
   The competition is now a subject of the FBI inquiry into alleged
Pentagon bribery and fraud in awarding military contracts,
according to present and former executives of the companies,
federal investigators and others familiar with the case.
   It also is being examined by a separate SEC investigation
looking at whether information leaks from the Navy affected trading
in the stock of Airship Industries, the executives and
investigators told the Times.
   The $168.9 million airship prototype contract was awarded to
Westinghouse-Airship in June 1987.
   Information suggests the FBI is looking at the airship
consultants used by the Loral Corp., which acquired Goodyear
Aerospace during the competition, the Times said. The information
also suggests the SEC is looking at whether Navy leaks affected
trading in Airship stock before the winning bid was announced, it
said.
   The price of Airship stock, which trades over the counter in the
United States, soared to $31 from $16 in the weeks before the
contract award was announced, the report said.
   The stock is currently trading near $4, reflecting financing
troubles for the airship after the Navy terminated the project
earlier this year and passed it on to another Pentagon branch.
   Goodyear Aerospace retained at least two Washington-area
consultants who have figured in the Pentagon fraud inquiry, William
M. Galvin and William Parkin, aerospace executives familiar with
the program told the Times.
   Federal investigators searched Loral's Akron, Ohio, offices in
June, focusing on company consultants used for the airship
competition, according to Thomas M. Seese, president of the United
Auto Workers local which represents about 1,400 workers at Loral's
Akron plant.
   A Loral spokeswoman, Elizabeth Allen, said the company felt it
was inappropriate to comment on the investigation, but said Loral
was cooperating with investigators and believed the its activities
were within ``the letter and the spirit of the law.''
   The Westinghouse-Airship team retained for its liaison with the
Navy a Washington lawyer who was a friend of then-Navy Secretary
John F. Lehman Jr., according to Airship officials.
   There is no indication that activities of the lawyer or Lehman
are under investigation in the blimp matter, the Times said. Lehman
did not return telephone calls; the lawyer declined to comment.
   A Westinghouse spokesman, Dick King, declined to comment on the
use of consultants in the airship competition, but said the company
was cooperating with an SEC inquiry into the trading of Airship
stock.
   Officials of both agencies declined to discuss their inquiries.
No one has been charged with wrongdoing. Navy officials declined to
say why Westinghouse got the contract, the Times said.

<HEAD>Italian Navy Says Iranian Airliner Was Outside Commercial Corridor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officers aboard an Italian frigate in the Persian
Gulf say the Iranian jetliner shot down by an American warship was
flying outside the commercial air corridor, an Italian Navy
spokesman said today.
   The route of the Iranian Airbus was detected by officers aboard
the Espero, which was escorting the Italian cargo ship Jolly
Smeraldo through the Strait of Hormuz, said the spokesman, speaking
under the usual groundrules of anonymity.
   He said Italian radar screens showed that the Iranian plane, on
a 150-mile flight from Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai in the United
Arab Emirates, was outside the route reserved for civilian planes.
   The spokesman didn't elaborate, but Adm. William Crowe, chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in Washington on Sunday
that the aircraft approached the cruiser Vincennes four or five
miles outside a commercial corridor used by civilian craft in the
area.
   Iran has claimed the plane was inside a commercial corridor.
   The Italian military spokesman said the Italian officers heard
the commander of the Vincennes send four radio warnings to the
pilot of the Iranian plane, but there was no response.
   The Italians later heard the Americans announce they had downed
an Iranian F-14, the spokesman said.
   Italy sent a naval task force to the gulf last year to protect
Italian merchant ships in the waterway.
   The spokesman said the Italian frigate had offered several times
to help in rescue efforts on Sunday but never received an Iranian
response. The escort mission continued today.

   Pakistan's military attache to Iran
and his family were among the 290 people killed when the U.S. Navy
shot down an Iranian jetliner, a government spokesman said today.
   Capt. Munir Ashad, his wife and two children were killed when a
U.S. surface-to-air missile hit the jet Sunday as it flew from
Iran's coastal city of Bandar Abbas to Dubai across the Persian
Gulf in the United Arab Emirates, spokesman Nasser Jamal said.
   President Zia ul-Haq called for an investigation and punishment
of those responsible for the attack, which he called an
``unpardonable deed.''
   He said it underscores ``the need for all outside forces in the
gulf to de-escalate their activities and to desist from acts which
lead to further aggravation of tensions in the region and
intensification of the Iran-Iraq war.''
   Jamal said Pakistan's Foreign Ministry was trying to discover
whether other Pakistanis were aboard the plane.

<HEAD>Prayers For Rain Offered By Politicians, Hari Krishnas</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians, Hare Krishnas and others prayed for rain to end the
crop-killing drought, which snuffed Fourth of July fireworks in
communities worried the holiday tradition might start fires.
   Crews fought forest fires in Wyoming, Michigan, California and
Washington state.
   Thunderstorms fell Sunday in Montana and parts of the Gulf
Coast. Today's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms in many parts of the nation _ except the parched
Midwest.
   In Minnesota, the Hare Krishna League of Devotees of Minneapolis
performed an emergency rain dance and chanting session Sunday.
   ``The drought is God's arrangement that we don't forget about
him,'' said Krishna-Katha, the group's president. ``Science and
economics can't make it rain _ not even Ronald Reagan can. Only God
can make it rain.''
   The drought has left Minnehaha Creek in Minneapolis bone dry.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Laughing Waters of Minnehaha Falls
couldn't even manage a smirk Sunday as the robed dancers sang
above. The famous falls barely dripped.
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson declared Sunday ``a statewide
day of prayer for rain'' in Illinois.
   ``The people of this ... state need to come to their senses and
their knees to seek an end to the drought,'' said Illinois'
Assistant House Minority Leader Penny Pullen. But no rain is
forecast for the state through Friday.
   Many farmers already are praying for relief as hard as they can,
said an Indiana priest.
   ``People make more of an attempt for a deeper prayer life
because of this, because it's a challenge,'' said the Rev. John
Boeglin of St. Celestine Roman Catholic Church in Indiana's Dubois
County.
   Hot, dry weather that left northwestern Wyoming forests
tinder-dry helped fires in Yellowstone National Park and adjacent
Shoshone National Forest grow to more than 3,000 acres Sunday,
officials said.
   In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a fire mostly in the Hiawatha
National Forest was contained Sunday after consuming 1,100 acres.
Two firefighters were injured.
   In northeast Washington state, firefighters today doused hot
spots left by two fires that consumed 970 acres of forest, brush
and rangeland.
   Minnesota firefighting crews were on standby over the holiday
weekend to douse any flames caused by fireworks above tinder-dry
fields. Five fires in the Cambridge area of central Minnesota were
started by illegal firecrackers Friday, said Department of Natural
Resources spokesman Tom Baumann.
   California fire officials said they found evidence that an
870-acre brushfire burning early today near Yosemite National Park
also may have been caused by illegal fireworks.
   Bans on fireworks were in place in sections of Wisconsin,
Indiana, Iowa, North Dakota, Kentucky, Tennessee, California and
elsewhere.
   The drought is also affecting business for canoe tour operators
on north Georgia's rivers.
   Appalachian Adventures, owned by Dana and Ben LaChance, operates
on the Etowah and Chestatee rivers but their canoes are idle.
   ``Ben was paddling the Etowah to see if it was OK to run a group
of 12 canoes,'' Dana LaChance said. ``It was so bad he pulled the
canoe out of the river and carried it two to three hundred yards to
the car.''
   Some farmers in Southern California, which has been blessed with
relatively good weather, are benefitting from the increase in crop
prices triggered by the drought.
   California wheat growers like Santa Ynez's Doug Mosebar are
earning top dollar because of stunted production on the Great
Plains.
   ``We are pushing up to $135 to $140 a ton,'' said Mosebar.
``Normally, I expected us to see about $95 a ton.''

   The cheers of thousands echoed on a
hillside here as a tongue of flame atop the Eternal Light Peace
Memorial burst skyward for the first time in 15 years.
   More than 20,000 people witnessed the relighting Sunday of the
memorial that was first ignited 50 years ago in memory of those who
fought and died in the Civil War Battle of Gettysburg.
   ``It's time for us to learn from the sacrifice of those who fell
here. And it is time to act,'' astronomer Carl Sagan said in his
dedication address.
   ``The real triumph of Gettysburg was not, I think, in 1863. It
was 50 years later, when the veterans, the remnants of the
adversary forces, the Blue and the Gray, met in celebration and in
solemn memorial,'' Sagan said. ``It is time to emulate them.''
   The flame will be kept burning continuously atop the limestone
and granite monument, which was dedicated 50 years ago by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt in a ceremony that drew more than 450,000
people.
   The light burned unceasingly for 35 years except for a two-year
break during World War II. In 1973, it was extinguished by a
congressional order banning all ornamental uses of energy during
the height of the oil crisis except for the flame on President John
F. Kennedy's grave in Arlington National Cemetery.
   The monument remained dark for three years. The natural gas
light then was converted to an electric light that has burned for
the past 12 years.
   The relighting of the gas-fueled flame is ``a dream come true''
for state Rep. Ken Cole of Adams. His uncle Paul Roy, who was then
editor of the Gettysburg Times, conceived the idea for the original
flame and monument, and mounted a nationwide fund-raising effort to
build it.
   ``When they put the light bulb up there and extinguished the
flame, it kind of took the heart out of the monument,'' Cole said.
   The relighting was not lost on Arthur Rice, who witnessed the
original lighting in 1938 and whose relatives helped plan that
ceremony.
   ``I think the idea of rededicating it for peace, for a world
united, is something they would be happy with,'' he said.
   Three central Pennsylvania companys have offered to pay for the
first year's fuel bill.

   Space shuttle Discovery made its
long-delayed trip to the launch pad today, cheered on by
flag-waving workers who have waited 2{ years for a rebirth of the
American space program.
   ``America, the dream is still alive,'' astronaut Dave Hilmers
told a Fourth of July crowd of several hundred engineers,
technicians and others who watched as the 85-ton spaceship edged
out of an assembly building into the glare of floodlights at 12:50
a.m.
   ``What more fitting present can we make to our country than this
on the day of its birthday,'' said Hilmers, one of five crew
members scheduled to fly Discovery on the first post-Challenger
mission, set for early September.
   Discovery, attached to its external fuel tank and two solid-fuel
booster rockets, was perched on the broad back of a giant tracked
transporter that lumbered along at less than 1 mph in covering the
4.2-mile route to the pad in 6{ hours.
   The shuttle arrived at Pad 39B at 7:30 a.m., and technicians
began connecting its various systems to the launch tower, including
air-conditioning and electricity, and extending platforms from the
pad so workers can have access to the shuttle.
   NASA scheduled the move in the early morning to avoid
thunderstorms and lightning that are common during the daytime in
the summer months.
   For three hours, starting at 8 a.m., space center workers and
their families were permitted to drive personal cars past the
launch pad for a good look at Discovery before a service structure
enclosed it.
   A recording of ``The Star Spangled Banner'' was played as the
shuttle began the move to Launch Pad 39B, the same pad from which
Challenger was launched on the flight that killed seven astronauts
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   ``It's been a long 2{ years since Challenger, and I'm very
pleased with the progress we've made during that time,'' Forrest S.
McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center, said at the
rollout ceremony. ``It's been a team effort. ... This is a proud
day.''
   McCartney presented Hilmers with a book containing the names of
more than 15,000 Kennedy Space Center workers who have labored to
return the shuttle fleet to space.
   Hilmers said the astronauts would carry the book, bearing the
inscription ``The KSC team is with you,'' into orbit aboard
Discovery, ``knowing that our journey will be safer because of
you.''
   ``It kind of brings tears to your eyes after so long a time of
struggling and looking at ourselves inwardly and outwardly, and
here it is; it's finally a reality,'' Hilmers said.
   ``This is what I call a happy Fourth of July,'' said astronaut
Bob Crippen, a veteran of four shuttle flights who is now deputy
director of shuttle operations.
   Workers were to spend several hours securing Discovery on the
pad and then begin preparing it for a critical test-firing of its
three main liquid fuel engines. The test, with the spaceship bolted
firmly on its launch mounts, is set for July 24.
   The following day, a final pre-flight test-firing of the
redesigned solid-fuel booster rocket is planned at the Morton
Thiokol plant in Utah. Both tests must be passed before Discovery
is certified for flight.
   The failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed
Challenger 73 seconds after liftoff. Since then, the booster has
been significantly redesigned and tested, and hundreds of other
modifications have been made to the shuttle main engines and other
systems.
   Hilmers and four other veteran shuttle crew members will be at
the controls when Discovery blasts off on a four-day mission. The
others are commander Rick Hauck, Dick Covey, Mike Lounge and George
Nelson.
   They will deploy a communications satellite, conduct scientific
and technical experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter
systems.

   Amid fanfare rivaling that of the
Olympics and Super Bowl, this city gave itself a star-studded 75th
birthday party capped with fireworks, music, and a
diamond-encrusted cake worth $20 million.
   ``Happy Birthday, Beverly Hills,'' said singer Dinah Shore, a
20-year resident who was master of ceremonies Sunday night on a
Academy Awards-like stage on the football field of Beverly Hills
High School.
   ``We have the best of everything here, the best schools, the
best police department ... the best hotels and the best
restaurants,'' Miss Shore said. ``I'm glad I raised my children
here.''
   The 90-minute show featured skits, music and dancing
commemorating the city's history. More than 1,000 singers, dancers,
actors and non-celebrity residents recalled Beverly Hills'
transformation from a lima bean field to 5.6 square miles of some
of the world's most expensive property.
   Radio personality Casey Kasem led a 75-second countdown to the
show's start, which erupted in fireworks and the release of 1,000
balloons, some shaped like silver-and-white birthday candles.
   Jose Feliciano sang ``America the Beautiful'' to the audience of
10,000, and Desi Arnaz Jr. led more more than 100 dancers, mariachi
musicians and horse riders in a salute to the area's Mexican past.
   The city, which draws more tourists than Disneyland, is home to
mansions, Rodeo Drive boutiques and more Rolls Royces per capita
than London. The average income among its 33,000 residents is
$125,000 and its 100 financial institutions have $8 billion in
deposits.
   Will Rogers Jr., son of the late humorist Will Rogers who was
the city's first honorary mayor, told how the battle to incorporate
Beverly Hills in 1914 was nearly lost.
   He said his father went door to door promising residents an
autographed photograph of himself if they voted in favor of
independence versus annexation to Los Angeles. Independence won
easily.
   Gene Barry and Barbara Eden led a dance tribute to the Beverly
Hills Hotel that featured waiters, housekeepers and bellhops from
the legendary pink-and-green palace on Sunset Boulevard.
   The number ended with a parade of stars, including Jimmy
Stewart, Robert Stack and Dick Van Patten. Models wearing $20
million worth of jewelry portrayed affluent hotel-goers,
disembarking from $5 million worth of antique cars on a
100-foot-long stage.
   Motorcycle police escorted an armored truck onstage for the
presentation of the official symbol of the celebration: a piece of
birthday cake iced with 2,600 white diamonds valued at $20 million.
   ``Our birthday cake is so special you can only order it by the
slice,'' Miss Shore said.
   Earlier, local chefs sliced another 1{-ton, 300-square-foot
birthday cake shaped like city hall for 10,000 residents during a
day-long celebration in a local park.
   Local elementary and high school students, marching bands and
cheerleaders performed onstage before a finale of fireworks that
lit up the sky, reflecting off the skyscrapers of adjacent Century
City.
   The show was produced by Radio City Music Hall Productions,
which in January staged the Super Bowl XXII halftime show in San
Diego. Proceeds were to benefit 11 local charities.
   The celebration, which continues for 14 months, will include an
ABC network special in January and a grand finale on Labor Day
weekend 1989 when the world's top fashion designers and 1,000
models come together in what is billed as the world's largest
fashion show.

   The United States will host the 1994
World Cup, soccer's world governing body announced today.
   The International Football Association, known as FIFA, picked
the United States ahead of Brazil and Morocco, the other two
nations that had bid to stage the 1994 tournament.
   The group's executive committee gave the United States 10 votes,
Morocco seven and Brazil two.
   Today's decision, taken in a Zurich hotel, also means that the
United States, as host nation, automatically qualifies for the
competition.
   The 1994 competition will be the 15th World Cup, which dates
back to 1930 and is held every four years. Since that time, the
tournament has passed between Europe and Latin America, soccer's
two traditional powerhouses.
   In 1990, Italy stages the competition for the second time.
   The U.S. proposal includes 18 possible stadiums throughout the
country, of which 12 would be used during the monthlong, 52-match
tournament.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union announced today it would grant an
amnesty to any of its troops who deserted their units in
Afghanistan during the nation's eight-year involvement in the war
there.
   Prosecutor General A. Y. Sukharev told a news conference in
Moscow the amnesty was being offered to about 200 Soviet soldiers
who either deserted or became separated from their units during the
war.
   The Soviet Union began pulling its forces out of Afghanistan on
May 15 under accords signed in Geneva, and units still in
Afghanistan awaiting withdrawal are not taking part in offensive
operations.
   Sukharev said any soldier who returns to the Soviet Union ``will
enjoy all political, social and all other rights guaranteed by
Soviet law.''
   Asked specifically if the amnesty applied to deserters, he said
it would apply to all servicemen who became victims of ``extreme
conditions'' in Afghanistan and that ``from the standpoint of
humanism, an amnesty will be applied to them.''
   The Soviet Union has listed 312 soldiers missing in action in
Afghanistan.
   Sukharov said authorities have determined that about one third
of that number died and that perhaps 200 remain on the territory of
neighboring Pakistan. Many of those may be prisoners of rebel units
that have operated with Pakistani aid.
   Sukharev said some soldiers are believed to be in the United
States, Canada or Western Europe. He gave no indication how many.
   The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979.

   Members of Congress today generally defended
the U.S. missile attack on an Iranian passenger jet but they called
for a thorough investigation and a review of U.S. policy in the
Persian Gulf.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, interviewed on NBC-TV's
``Today'' program, said all information about the destruction of
the jet should be released publicly ``to demonstrate that the
United States does not make war on innocents, that this was a
terrible accident, that we deeply regret it.''
   But the Washington Democrat said ``it would be a great mistake
for the United States to abruptly withdraw its forces after this
tragic accident.''
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said the U.S. policy in the Persian
Gulf ``was never a very good one to begin with and this incident,
this sort of thing was very predictable.''
   ``If our policy remains the same, we'll see more of these things
happen,'' he said on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program. ``The
magnitude of this tragedy demands we take another look at this
policy.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., also interviewed on the CBS program,
said ``the policy of trying to protect commercial shipping in the
Gulf is absolutely right.''
   Other members of Congress defended the response of the commander
of the cruiser that fired the missle, but they also want answers
from the Reagan administration to some tough questions.
   ``American military forces must always have the right to defend
themselves, and preliminary information indicates that the on-scene
commander believed his forces were in imminent danger,'' said Sen.
Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   But Nunn, D-Ga., said he wants answers to such key questions as
how the U.S. Navy has previously handled commercial airline traffic
in the region and what rules of engagement and decision-making led
to Sunday's decision to shoot down the plane. All 290 people aboard
Iran Air flight 655 were presumed dead after the jetliner was hit
by a U.S. missile and exploded in midair.
   President Reagan and other administration officials said the
crew of the cruiser USS Vincennes mistook the approaching jetliner
for an Iranian F-14 attack plane and fired in self-defense.
   Some members of Congress coupled expressions of regret with
criticism of the administration policies that put U.S. forces in
the gulf in the first place.
   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the No. 3 man in the House
leadership, said, ``The Persian Gulf operation lacks definition and
reason, and this kind of tragedy is the inevitable result. If a
retaliatory act of terror is Iran's response, who will remember
this mission to protect commercial shipping or its purpose?''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said that ``much of the responsibility rests
with the government of Iran for its irresponsible conduct during
these past years. But policy errors have led the United States to
become more involved in the Persian Gulf than our security needs
and the defense of freedom of the seas require.''
   But Republicans such as Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas defended
Reagan's policy of deploying U.S. forces in the gulf to provide
U.S. protection to neutral shipping.
   Gramm said he did not believe the incident showed any flaws in
U.S. olicy. ``We have saved lives,'' by being in the Persian Gulf,
he said.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said that from what he knows so far,
``it seems reasonable to believe that the U.S. Navy acted in an
appropriate manner.''
   But he called the downing of the jetliner a ``horrible, horrible
tragedy'' and said, ``I, too, have many unanswered questions. I'll
reserve final judgment until I have more details.''
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., predicted the incident would cause
``major disruptions in the Arab world'' but said friction could be
reduced ``by having a body like the U.N. step forward and provide a
forum for some of the tensions that are going to be incurred.''
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said Americans ``should give the Navy every
benefit of the doubt until all the facts are in with regard to what
was done to defend the lives of American sailors.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said the deaths were ``regrettable,
but the actions of the Iranian plane left the U.S. Navy no other
recourse.''
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., called the incident ``unfortunate,''
although he added, ``I don't think the captain had much of
alternative.''
   He said that even if the plane had been identified as an Airbus
jetliner, the U.S. ship's captain could have reasonably feared it
was a ``kamikaze plane'' since it ignored warnings and was outside
a normal commercial air channel.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said he was ``saddened that such a
tragedy should happen in a part of the world that already has known
too much human suffering.''
   One member of House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Buddy Darden,
D-Ga., said such a tragedy could have been foreseen because of
Iran's actions in the gulf.
   ``I'm not saying the Iranians deserved what they got ... but the
Iranians helped create the climate which led to the destruction of
this airliner,'' he said.
   Another member of the House committee, Rep. Dave McCurdy,
D-Okla., said the incident ``just has to weigh heavy on the captain
of the vessel, but also on the entire U.S. Navy.''
   ``But with any operation like that there is also going to be
some risk ... danger to U.S. forces or innocent bystanders,''
McCurdy continued.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Right-wing politicians and a
pro-government newspaper today urged the government to retaliate
against African National Congress guerrillas for a bombing outside
a rugby stadium.
   ``The ANC should be killed at its origin, even if it is in
London or Lusaka (Zambia),'' said Moolman Mentz, a Parliament
member for the far-right Conservative Party.
   Two white men were killed and at least 35 people, most of them
white, were injured in Saturday's bombing, which occurred as
thousands of spectators were leaving Johannesburg's Ellis Park
after a rugby match.
   Twelve of the injured remained hospitalized today.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said ``top South
African government sources'' were predicting retaliation for the
act.
   Police said the bomb, placed under a stolen car that had been
parked near the stadium since Friday night, contained 220 pounds of
explosives _ the largest ever detonated in Johannesburg.
   Sports administrators said they would tighten security at
stadiums.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu deplored the bombing and
offered to mediate between the government, the African National
Congress and another outlawed group, the Pan Africanist Congress.
   ``Until the authorities agree to sit down and negotiate real
power-sharing with the authentic leaders of our people, this
dreadful carnage will not end,'' Tutu said in a statement.
   There have been more than 90 bombings in South Africa since a
national state of emergency was declared in June 1986. Since
January, 27 explosions killed 12 people and injured 110.
   The African National Congress said recently it intended to step
up its military campaign. But the organization has declined
specific comment on recent attacks, including Saturday's bombing.
   The Sowetan, the country's only daily newspaper for blacks,
called the bombing ``distasteful and unwarranted,'' but indicated
doubt that the ANC was responsible for ``involving civilians in
violent attacks.''
   The paper blamed the bombing on the government's policy of
apartheid, which establishes a racially segregated society in which
the 5 million whites control national affairs, while denying a vote
to the 26 million blacks.
   ``We have always said that apartheid is institutionalized
violence,'' it said, referring to a government proposal last week
to tighten enforcement of residential segregation.
   The Citizen's editorial described the ANC as a terrorist
organization.
   Any steps taken against the ANC ``will have the support of the
great majority of people,'' it said.

   Japan Air Lines said today its twice-weekly flight
from Tokyo to Athens, Greece, will change its Persian Gulf route to
avoid the zone where an Iranian airliner was shot down by the U.S.
Navy.
   A JAL official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
company's airliners will begin flying over Abu Dhabi, in the United
Arab Emirates instead of over Dubai, also in the same country but
closer to the gulf, where the Iranian airliner was shot down.
   On Sunday, a U.S. Navy ship in the gulf downed an Iranian civil
airliner with 290 people on board after mistaking it for a warplane.
   The airline official said a JAL DC-10 with 156 passengers and 16
crew members left Tokyo for Athens today using the new routing,
which is further south. He said the change added less than five
minutes to the flight time.

   Yasser Arafat's guerrillas today held off
Syrian-backed PLO dissidents seeking to storm the Arafat loyalists'
last Beirut stronghold. Police said at least 21 people were killed
and 67 wounded.
   Six hours of fierce fighting, which included rocket barrages and
mortar fire, began at dawn in the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp.
   The latest casualties raised the toll to at least 148 killed and
594 wounded since battles broke out May 1 between Col. Saeed
Mousa's dissident Fatah-Uprising faction and Arafat's Fatah group.
   Today's fighting ended a week-long lull in the battle between
the rival factions for control of Beirut's two remaining
Palestinian refugee camps.
   Mousa's men overran the nearby Chatilla camp June 27 and had
been expected to move on Bourj el-Barajneh.
   Police said 20 rounds a minute were exploding today in the
sprawling shantytown on Beirut's southern outskirts and that the
fighting forced the closing of the airport highway that runs
parallel to the camp's western edge.
   Airport officials said flight schedules were not affected.
Travelers reached the airport by sidestreests.
   Black smoke billowed from Bourj el-Barajneh as Mousa's gunners,
deployed in Syrian-controlled hills overlooking Beirut, pounded the
camp with 120mm and 160mm mortars, rockets, and 106mm recoilless
guns, police reported.
   They said Arafat's loyalists responded with 62mm mortars.
   An official of Fatah, the main component of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, said by telephone that his men repulsed 10
attacks by dissidents trying to push into the camp today
   Fatah pushed Mousa's followers out of Bourj el-Barajneh and
Chatilla in earlier fighting.
   The dissidents then regrouped along the Syrian-controlled edges
of the camps and overran Chatilla last week in a 13-hour battle
that demolished the shantytown and displaced hundreds of refugees.
   The next day, Libyan mediators sponsored the evacuation of about
150 Arafat guerrillas from Chatilla to Fatah bases in the port city
of Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   The fall of Chatilla was a serious setback for Arafat and the
Fatah official said his fighters were determined to hold out and
defend Bourj el-Barajneh ``to the last man.''
   He said 80 percent of the camp was devastated by earlier
bombardments and that only 3,000 out of its original 20,000
residents remain.
   Dozens of civilians fled the camp during the week-long lull in
fighting after Chatilla fell.
   The camps have been largely destroyed by fighting that began
when the Israelis invaded Lebanon in 1982, besieged west Beirut and
hammered the shantytowns with air raids and shellfire for months.
   Pro-Israeli Christian militiamen massacred hundreds of civilians
in Chatilla and the neighboring Sabra camp in September 1982.
   And Syrian-backed Lebanese Shiite Moslems besieged the camps in
1985.
   They pounded them for more than two years in an abortive effort
to prevent Arafat from rebuilding the power base he lost when the
Israelis drove the PLO out of Beirut in 1982.
   The Shiites bulldozed Sabra flat, but Chatilla and Bourj
el-Barajneh held out until the Shiites lifted their siege earlier
this year.
   Mousa broke away from the PLO in 1983 in a Syrian-backed mutiny
by radicals opposed to Arafat's policies. Mousa set up his
headquarters in the Syrian capital of Damascus.
   The Beirut fighting has flared despite a reconciliation between
Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad last April to end a
5-year-old feud over control of the Palestinian movement.

   Vice President George Bush today
expressed deep regrets about the downing of an Iranian civilian
aircraft but says the captain of the U.S. warship that fired on the
aircraft appeared to have made the right decision.
   Bush, speaking to reporters at the Detroit airport on his way to
an Independence Day parade here, said ``it appears the captain of
the ship followed the rules ... he did what he had to do.''
   The vice president, the certain Republican presidential nominee,
dismissed any comparison between Sunday's tragedy and the Soviet
destruction of a Korean airliner that strayed into Russian airspace
on a trip from New York to Seoul, South Korea, in 1983.
   ``I would just reject the comparison,'' Bush said. ``This plane
was warned. This plane was flying in a combat area. It's totally
separate, totally different.''
   Bush said he did not think the episode would jeopardize
President Reagan's Persian Gulf policies and said he believed that
Americans were pulling together in support of the captain of the
USS Vincennes.
   ``Obviously, as we celebrate our great national holiday, our
hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were
lost,'' Bush said.
   Asked how significant the disaster was in terms of U.S. policy
in the Persian Gulf, Bush said, ``I don't think its more
significant than other incidents but it is significant.''
   Asked whether his decision to campaign today might send the
wrong signals in view of the gravity of the situation, Bush said,
``This is a national holiday. It is appropriate that we celebrate
it ... there is nothing I could be doing about this matter in
Washington, D.C.''
   ``Life goes on and our mission goes on and the world keeps
turning,'' he said.
   Bush, who spent the weekend at his vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, was to march in this Detroit suburb's morning
parade and then to participate in Fourth of July festivities in the
Chicago area and in St. Louis.

   Iranians today pulled the bodies of men,
women and children from the Persian Gulf and vowed to avenge
``premeditated, cold-blooded murder'' after the U.S. Navy shot down
an Iranian jetliner carrying 290 people.
   The United States said its forces mistook the wide-bodied Iran
Air Airbus for a F-14 fighter and shot it down Sunday when it
failed to heed seven warnings.
   Iran said all aboard were killed and proclaimed today, the
Fourth of July, a day of mourning.
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei said today that Iran is ``ready
to fight ... American aggression.''
   Khamenei said in an interview on Tehran Radio, monitored in
Nicosia, that ``we wish to warn that the American government will
have to suffer the consequences of its recent crime in the Persian
Gulf.'' He did not elaborate.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said said 168 bodies
had been recovered by today, including at least 38 foreigners.
   It listed them as 12 United Arab Emirates citizens, eight
Indians, eight Pakistanis, six Yugoslavs, two Kuwaitis and Italian
and an Afghan. Airline officials said the rest of the passengers
were Iranians.
   The casualty toll of 290 would make it the sixth-worst
commercial air disaster in history.
   ``The criminal United States should know that blood unlawfully
shed in the disaster ... will be avenged in the same
blood-spattered sky over the Persian Gulf,'' Tehran Radio said in
an earlier broadcast also monitored in Nicosia.
   It accused the United States of directly aiding Iraq, Iran's
enemy in the nearly 8-year-old gulf war. The United States says its
warships are in the gulf to keep international sea lanes open to
neutral shipping.
   The United States has ``entered a more direct war with our
nation,'' IRNA quoted Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi as
saying.
   ``The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran considers this
a premeditated cold-blooded murder,'' said a statement read by
Mohammad Javad Zarif, counselor of Iran's mission to the United
Nations.
   Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said in a message
to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that the world
body should ``openly condemn the perpetrator of this atrocity,''
IRNA reported.
   But Iran's ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Mustafa
Foumeni Haeri, said, ``If the United States says it will change its
policy in the gulf and stop its interference in the region, the
case will then be closed.''
   Iran Air flight 655 was on a routine 150-mile flight between
Iran's coastal city of Bandar Abbas and Dubai, across the gulf in
the United Arab Emirates. IRNA said the jet left Bandar Abbas,
where Iran has a big naval and air base, at 10:15 a.m. Sunday.
   Two U.S. missiles hit the Iran Air jet 15 minutes later and the
plane exploded at an altitude of 7,500 feet, IRNA said.
   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said the plane was outside the prescribed commercial air corridor.
   But state-run Tehran radio, monitored in London, said it had
been flying ``precisely in the international corridor.
   Crowe said the Iranian jetliner flew directly at the USS
Vincennes as the warship exchanged fire with several of Iran's
Boghammar gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, entry to the gulf.
   The cruiser and a smaller U.S. frigate, the USS Elmer
Montgomery, fired 5-inch guns at the boats, sinking two and
damaging a third, the Pentagon said.
   IRNA said two Iranian sailors listed as missing in Sunday's
clashes were rescued unharmed in the gulf several hours later. It
gave no details.
   Crowe said the Vincennes fired two Standard surface-to-air
missiles at the airliner seven minutes after it was detected by
radar. During the seven minutes, the jetliner ignored three
warnings on a civilian distress network and four on a military
distress network, he said.
   There was no word on whether the Iranians had recovered the
airliner's black box, which contains recordings of the plane's
systems and radio communications.
   The gulf air corridor is one of the world's busiest, despite the
hazards of flying over the waterway where Iran and Iraq have been
at war for nearly eight years.
   Crowe said the American forces ``acted with good judgment.''
   The statement from the Iranian mission said: ``We are outraged
that the American officials have considered the shooting down of a
passenger plane by their missiles a `good judgment' on the part of
the naval unit.''
   U.S. officials said there were no American casualties in
Sunday's clash, the second major skirmish between U.S. and Iranian
forces in the gulf in three months.
   On April 18, American warships and planes, retaliating for the
mining of a U.S. missile frigate, destroyed two Iranian oil rigs
and sank or disabled six of Iran's naval craft, including two of
its best frigates.
   On May 17, 1987, the frigate USS Stark was hit in the gulf by a
missile fired by an Iraqi warplane, and 37 crew members died. Iraq
called the attack a mistake and Washington accepted the explanation
and apology.

   Americans kicked off their Fourth of July celebrations early
today with a flag-waving sendoff for the space shuttle Discovery's
move to its launch pad, and most of the nation had bright sunshine
for a holiday shadowed by distant tragedy.
   ``America, the dream is still alive,'' astronaut Dave Hilmers
told a crowd of several hundred engineers, technicians and others
at Kennedy Space Center.
   Around the country, drought left many Americans facing a
fair-weather Fourth without fireworks as the nation marked its
212th birthday with parades, food fests and other fun.
   Many Wisconsin communities canceled fireworks because of the
fire danger, so more than 580,000 people jammed Milwaukee's Lake
Michigan shore Sunday for a 4,000-shell display. Traffic was so
backed up that people driving into the area after 6 p.m. were
``just basically spinning their wheels,'' said police Sgt. Ken
Romels.
   Showers and occasional thunderstorms developed over parts of the
South, with some showers over the Rockies and northern Plains, but
today was hot and sunny over most of the rest of the nation.
   The holiday atmosphere at home contrasted starkly with events in
the Persian Gulf, where an American warship on Sunday downed an
Iranian jetliner it mistook for an attacking plane. All 290 people
aboard the jet were killed and President Reagan called the missile
attack ``a terrible human tragedy.''
   In Philadelphia, where the Declaration of Independence was
signed in 1776, festivities were to kick off today with the Freedom
Festival Parade, featuring high school bands from across America. A
ceremony was scheduled later on the steps of Independence Hall,
scene of the historic signing.
   City officials on Sunday announced the creation of the
Philadelphia Liberty Medal, an annual $100,000 prize to be given
each July Fourth to someone in the world who has promoted freedom.
   Tens of thousands of people were expected tonight for an annual
fireworks display at the Empire State Plaza in Albany, N.Y., while
even more were expected to watch a fireworks extravaganza over New
York City's East River.
   In Chicago, fireworks scheduled for tonight along the downtown
lakefront was tied in with the annual Taste of Chicago food
festival, which on Sunday drew thousands of people.
   In St. Louis, Vice President George Bush was to make two
appearances today at the giant VP Fair. Fair organizers were
expecting up to 1 million people to visit the Gateway Arch grounds
on the fair's third day.
   ``It's the biggest party I've ever seen,'' said former Olympic
gold medal gymnast Kurt Thomas, who gave a demonstration Sunday.
   In Pittsburgh, a four-day celebration at Point State Park
concludes tonight with a Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concert and
fireworks.
   Author James A. Michener and his wife, Mari, were to be grand
marshals in the annual Sitka, Alaska, Fourth of July parade.
Michener was greeted Sunday by a brass band as he returned to the
southeast Alaskan city, where he wrote much of his latest novel,
``Alaska.''
   More than 2,500 members of the Rainbow Family back-to-nature
group gathered in Zavalla, Texas, for the group's 17th annual July
Fourth celebration, where they pray for peace, love and harmony.
   On Cape Canaveral, Fla., Discovery moved into the glare of
spotlights early today on its long-awaited trip to the launch pad,
where it is scheduled to begin the first shuttle mission since the
Challenger disaster of Jan. 28, 1986.
   ``What more fitting present can we make to our country than this
on the day of its birthday,'' said astronaut Hilmers, one of the
five crew members who will fly Discovery in a launch scheduled for
early September.
   Independence Day revelers in parts of drought-stricken Tennessee
may find their fireworks in the courtroom if they insist on
violating local bans, officials said.
   In Greater Nashville's Davidson County, ``anyone who starts a
fire because they were lighting off fireworks will be held
responsible and prosecuted,'' said Paul Uselton, the city's deputy
police chief.
   Drought-triggered bans on fireworks were also in effect in
Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, North Dakota, Kentucky, California and
elsewhere.
   California fire officials said there was evidence an 870-acre
brushfire burning early today near Yosemite National Park may have
been caused by illegal fireworks.
   Independence, Mo., devised a novel way of celebrating during the
drought, replacing fireworks with a laser light show.
   In Chickamauga Park near Chattanooga, Tenn., history buffs
presented a holiday weekend Civil War encampment. Memories of the
Civil War also were rekindled Sunday at Gettysburg, Pa., where a
flame atop the Eternal Light Peace Memorial burst skyward for the
first time in 15 years.
   More than 20,000 people witnessed the relighting of the granite
and limestone memorial first ignited 50 years ago in memory of
those who fought and died in the Battle of Gettysburg. It was
extinguished during the energy crisis.
   In Hamburg, N.Y., a race between a buffalo named Harvey
Wallbanger and three harness racing horses entertained about 8,000
people at Buffalo Raceway. Harvey notched his 14th win in 17 races
against horses, covering the 80-yard course in 8 3-5 seconds.

   George Bush today expressed regrets about the destruction of an
Iranian passenger jet, but defended the captain of the U.S. warship
involved, saying ``he did what he had to do.'' Michael Dukakis,
expanding on his reaction Sunday, urged Iran to ``reconsider its
threats'' to respond with terrorism.
   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, called on the Reagan administration to
re-evaluate its Middle East policy in the wake of tragedy in the
Persian Gulf, but said the United States should maintain its
presence in the war-torn region.
   Bush, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, broke his silence
on the incident as he traveled to a Fourth of July celebration in
Michigan. The vice president, who spent the weekend in
Kennebunkport, Maine, was ``briefed throughout the day'' Sunday,
according to his press secretary, Sheila Tate, but he had no public
comment.
   ``Obviously, as we celebrate our great national holiday, our
hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were
lost,'' Bush said at the Detroit airport.
   The vice president dismissed any comparison between Sunday's
incident and the Soviet Union's downing of a Korean airliner that
had strayed into its airspace in 1983.
   ``This plane was warned,'' Bush said. ``This plane was flying in
a combat area. It's totally separate, totally different.''
   Bush also said ``it appears the captain of the ship followed the
rules ... he did what he had to do.''
   Likely Democratic nominee Dukakis, in Boston for Independence
Day celebrations, called on the United States to lead an
international effort to end the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``This is no time for acts of terror or revenge in response to
the incident,'' Dukakis said. ``So I urge the government of Iran to
reconsider its threats and to join us and the entire international
community in ending a war that already has taken the lives of more
than one million people.''
   Jackson also called for an end to the eight-year-old war.
   ``We in fact must move more quickly now to use our strength to
get Iran and Iraq back to the negotiating table,'' said Jackson,
interviewed on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program. ``We've not done
this as vigorously as we should have done it.''
   Jackson, interviewed from his Chicago home, rejected suggestions
that the U.S. withdraw from the troubled gulf.
   ``We should not move out unilaterally. The fact is they are
international waters. We do have a right to be there,'' said
Jackson.
   The Iranians said 290 people were aboard the Airbus, and all
were presumed dead. The Pentagon said the U.S. vessel that shot
down the jetliner believed it was under attack by a fighter plane.
   Dukakis said Sunday in a statement from his home in Brookline,
Mass., that he was ``saddened by the loss of life,'' but added:
``Plainly, our armed forces have a right to defend themselves when
attacked.''
   The Massachusetts governor was paying a Fourth of July visit
this morning at the USS Constitution in Charleston, Mass.
   Later, Dukakis and his wife Kitty were to dine with Jackson and
his wife, Jacqueline. The two couples were then attending a holiday
Boston Pops concert.
   With the Democratic National Convention opening two weeks from
today, Jackson has not said whether he would accept a spot on the
ticket. However, he has said for weeks he deserves to be offered
the vice presidential nomination.
   The Dukakis campaign has been screening a number of prospective
running mates, and says Jackson is under consideration.
   Jackson made another foray into Middle Eastern politics on
Sunday when he appealed Sunday to the captors of American and
European hostages in Lebanon to free their captives.
   ``Their captivity has reminded us that none of us is free until
all of us are free. I appeal to you from the depths of my heart and
soul to let them go. Their release could create a breakthrough of
better understanding,'' he said in a message taped Sunday in
Chicago. A text was released in Washington.
   The Jackson campaign said the tape would be distributed to
Lebanese news organizations, but provided no details.
   In the message, Jackson made particular mention of Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who is the longest held hostage. He was taken captive March 16,
1985.
   Jackson had no campaign appearances planned today.
   Bush's trip today was taking him to Michigan, Illinois and
Missouri. He was making appearances at several small-town holiday
celebrations, including a parade in Wyandotte, Mich. and an
Independence Day festival in Elmwood Park., Ill. He was also
attending a barbecue in St. Louis.
   In other developments over the holiday weekend:
   _Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, chosen to deliver the speech
nominating Dukakis at the Democratic National Convention, said he
hoped to introduce the Massachusetts governor to millions of voters.
   ``A lot of people are really going to be looking at him very
closely for the first time in this convention,'' Clinton said.
Dukakis campaign officials announced Saturday in Boston that
Clinton would deliver the nominating speech.
   _Television evangelist Pat Robertson, who called off his bid for
the Republican nomination earlier this year, said Bush has asked
him to help bring Robertson supporters into the fold. Robertson
said he had volunteered to campaign for Bush, especially in states
where he had beaten out the vice president.
   _ Ann Richards, who will give the keynote address at the
Democratic convention, said voters in her home state of Texas
consider Bush ``sort of silly'' and unable to understand the needs
of working Americans. Richards, the Texas state treasurer who was
picked last week to give the convention-opening address, said on
CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' that in her speech, she would talk
about ``American families (and) their concerns.''

   Members of Congress and Vice President George
Bush today rejected any comparison between the U.S. destruction of
an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gullf and the 1983 Soviet
downing of a Korean jet because the U.S. action occurred in a war
zone.
   ``This plane was warned. This plane was flying in a combat area.
It's totally separate, totally different,'' Bush told reporters in
Wyandotte, Mich., where he was campaigning.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, agreed, saying that unlike the Korean jet, the Iranian
plane had been warned on both civilian and military frequencies.
   ``There are a lot of differences between the two situations,''
he said in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Adm. William Crowe, the nation's top military officer, also drew
distinctions between the two attacks. He said the Iran Air plane
was descending toward the USS Vincennes and that its flight profile
and failure to respond to warnings ``led us to believe it was a
military aircraft.''
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that in the case
of Korean Air Lines flight 007 shot down by the Soviets, the plane
had been flying at a very high altitude and the Soviets never
claimed to believe it had been out ``to bomb or destroy.''
   ``The fundamental differences, of course, are that it was not a
war zone,'' Crowe said Sunday when asked to compare the Iran Air
shooting with the KAL incident. ``There was not combat in progress.
There was not combat there normally.''
   U.S. officials say the Navy ship was defending against what its
commander believed was a hostile military aircraft. Iran said all
290 people aboard the commercial jetliner were killed.
   The Pentagon initially reported that the Vincennes had shot down
an Iranian F-14 attack plane. Crowe acknowledged that the downed
aircraft was, in fact, a civilian airliner about 10 hours after the
incident occurred early Sunday.
   On Sept. 1, 1983, the Soviets shot down KAL 007 after it strayed
from its designated route into Soviet airspace after leaving
Anchorage, Alaska, on the last leg of a trip of trip to Seoul,
South Korea, from New York. All 269 people aboard were killed.
   It wasn't until Sept. 6 that the official Soviet news agency
Tass admitted that Soviet pilots had ``terminated'' the flight. The
Soviets claimed the plane has been spying for Washington and that
their pilots had a duty to destroy it. President Reagan assailed
the Soviets at the time for ``barbarity'' in shooting down an
unarmed plane.
   On Sunday, Reagan called the Persian Gulf incident a ``terrible
human tragedy'' but defended the U.S. decision to fire on the
Iranian airliner.
   Crowe said the KAL pilots had received no warning prior to the
Soviet attack, while the Iranian aircraft failed to heed repeated
warnings to steer clear of the cruiser USS Vincennes.
   ``The KAL 007 was not warned in any way, form, or fashion,''
Crowe said. ``Nor was, as far as I can tell or determine, any
attempt made to warn.''
   ``It was accused of being an intelligence gatherer,'' he said.
``That was certainly not the case.''
   After the KAL plane was shot down, Reagan said the United States
shared the ``disgust that the entire world feels at the barbarity
of the Soviet government in shooting down an unarmed plane. Words
can scarcely express our revulsion at this horrifying act of
violence.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Defends Vincennes Commander</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to edit</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of the USS Vincennes said before
leaving for the Persian Gulf that he would defend his ship if
threatened, and the Pentagon is standing by his decision to shoot
down an approaching Iranian airliner.
   Capt. Will C. Rogers III received support Sunday from the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe, who said
the airliner was outside commercial air lanes and ignored repeated
warnings to pull away from U.S. ships in the gulf. He said the
airliner was mistaken for an Iranian F-14 attack plane and was shot
down with 290 people aboard.
   ``A full investigation will be conducted but it is our judgment
that based on the information currently available, the local
commanders had sufficient reasons to believe their units were in
jeopardy and they fired in self defense,'' Crowe said at a Pentagon
briefing.
   Rogers was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and now lists his home as
San Diego, the Vincennes' home port. Pentagon officials said they
did not have his date of birth.
   In a radio interview before the Vincennes departed for the
Persian Gulf in April, Rogers was asked what the ship's response
would be if attacked and said: ``If we are attacked or hostile
intent is demonstrated we will defend ourselves.''
   ``There is a very clear-cut set of engagement rules which we go
by and we're certainly not there to initiate hostilities,'' Rogers
said. ``We're there to defend ourselves and carry out what national
command authority dictates.''
   Crowe noted that those rules of engagement were changed after
the May 1987 attack on the USS Stark, in which 37 U.S. sailors
died. U.S. commanders in the region are under orders to act more
quickly and forcefully if their ships are threatened.
   Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif., said he toured the Vincennes during
exercises off the San Diego coast in February and found Rogers to
be ``a first-rate professional.''
   ``It's a well-trained and disciplined crew and skipper,'' Lowery
said.
   Rogers also was supported by a former Navy lieutenant who
survived the May 1987 attack on the USS Stark in which 37 U.S.
sailors died. Basil E. Moncrief Jr., who resigned from the Navy in
the wake of the attack, said Rogers had no choice but to defend his
ship.
   ``If the plane was unfortunate enough to be flying toward the
Vincennes while the Vincennes was engaging Iranian patrol boats ...
I'm not surprised this kind of thing would happen,'' he told the
Corpus Christi Caller-Times. ``I don't think the Vincennes had much
choice other than to fire.''
   Before taking command of the Vincennes, Rogers served in the
Pentagon as head of a section in the Planning Division of Chief of
Naval Operations, the commander of the Navy, according to a
biography released at the Pentagon.
   His first command was the destroyer USS Cushing, from September
1981 to August 1984, the statement said.
   He was commissioned in December 1965 through officer training
school and spent his first tour of duty aboard the aircraft carrier
USS Independence, qualifying as a main watch officer, a main
propulsion division officer and an assistant combat information
center officer.
   Rogers is married to Sharon Rogers, also from Fort Worth, Texas.
They and their son, Will Rogers IV, live in San Diego, Calif., a
main Navy base for the Pacific Ocean.
   The captain is not related to the late American humorist, Will
Rogers, according to the humorist's son, Will Rogers Jr.

<HEAD>President May Intervene to Keep Couple Together</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's personal interest may keep
immigration officials from breaking up a Chicago couple and sending
the wife back to Portugal, according to Sen. Alan Dixon.
   Dr. Margarida Magalhaes, a native of Portugal, came to this
country seven years ago to study medicine on the condition that she
would practice in her own country for at least two years.
   But in the meantime, she married a Chicago physician, Dr.
William Silverman.
   When the expiration of her visa became imminent, the couple
applied for a special waiver to allow her to remain in this
country. It was denied in March, when federal officials ruled their
separation did not pose an ``exceptional hardship.''
   ``I was devastated,'' said Silverman. ``My whole world fell
apart. I couldn't imagine that an American wouldn't be allowed to
live with his wife in this country.''
   This weekend, however, Reagan telephoned Dixon, a Democrat, and
asked what he could do to help. The senator had been writing
letters to federal agencies in the couple's behalf with little
success.
   ``With the president interested, it's a totally different
case,'' Dixon said Sunday. ``If he (Reagan) says that this lady's
going to stay in the country, you can bet on it.''
   The president is to discuss the case with members of his staff
Tuesday, Dixon said.
   Meanwhile, the Silvermans have accepted fellowships at Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where they hope to be
together for two years of study.
   ``I'm holding my breath and hoping Mr. Reagan will do the right
thing,'' Silverman said. ``The 5th of July will be our Independence
Day.''

<HEAD>UC Libraries To Drop Information Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least two University of California
libraries are canceling use of a computerized NASA information
service because non-citizens are banned from using it.
   The federal restriction, which applies to both classifed and
non-classified material, violates the UC anti-discrimination policy
and would be hard to enforce because of the number of foreign
students on campus, university officials told the Los Angeles Times.
   Also, librarians fear prosecution if they mistakenly give
research material to the wrong person.
   A recent letter by Calvin Moore, UC associate vice president for
academic affairs, urged libraries on all nine campuses to cancel
contracts with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
for the service.
   The database summarizes hundreds of thousands of scientific
documents on such topics as space flight, and tells where the
complete versions are located.
   UCLA and UC Berkeley libraries will sign up for a competing
service that is more expensive, the Times said.
   ``Of course, librarians are not interested in doing anything to
overthrow the government, but on the other hand they are very
interested in confidentiality and freedom of information,'' said
Nancy Koller, who works at UC Riverside and is president of the
Librarians Association of UC.
   The citizenship restriction has been in all contracts for at
least nine years and UC may simply have overlooked it, said John
Wilson, NASA's manager of the database.
   Wilson said that to his knowledge, no one has been prosecuted
for letting a foreigner use the service.

<HEAD>Officials Perplexed Over Town's Unusual Cancer Rate Among Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSAMOND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This former gold mining town in the high
desert has a childhood cancer rate five times the average for a
town its size, and health officials say they are mystified as to a
cause.
   The only known similarity among the cases is that all the
children lived in the city during the same period, said Gary Euler,
public health epidemiologist for Kern County.
   ``There is no link to any particular area or playground,'' Euler
said. ``If we cannot link any common denominator, then it's not
likely that they are caused by the same factor or set of factors.
Then, they are not a true cancer cluster.''
   Eight children were stricken from 1976 to 1986, and only one has
survived. California Health Services Department officials say
they're especially perplexed by four children who all contracted a
rare form of cancer of the brain stem, known as medulloblastoma.
   The city's average rate of cancer cases is 72 per 100,000
annually for people 20 and younger, compared to 14 per 100,000 a
year in an average community, Euler said.
   Rosamond, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles, has a population
of 2,869, according to the 1980 census. Figures for the 20 and
younger population were unavailable.
   State health officials are testing soil from some industrial
sites, said Ron Baker, spokesman for the toxic substances control
divison of the Health Services Department.
   Rosamond is known mostly for its former gold mines. Mercury and
sodium cyanide, both toxic, were used to extract gold from ore and
cyanide is still used, said Tom Anderson, a senior geologist for
the California Division of Mines and Geology.

   Oil prices spurted briefly Monday and then settled
back down on news that the U.S. Navy shot down an Iranian civilian
jetliner in the Persian Gulf.
   The spot price of Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, jumped to $14.35 a barrel in Far Eastern
trading, up 20 cents from the close of trading in New York on
Friday.
   But later in London, the price had retreated to $14.15 a barrel.
   ``That's the usual knee-jerk reaction to anything happening in
the gulf,'' said Fergus MacLeod, an oil expert at the London
investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   An oil broker in the energy department at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in London, who didn't want to be identified further, said,
``It didn't last. All it did was bring sellers into the markets.
Since then it has been sold down.''
   ``There was obviously a lot of interest from the U.S. to find
out what was happening,'' she said.
   MacLeod added: ``The basic perception is that unless that
incident changes the U.S. public opinion about having the fleet in
the gulf, then it won't have much impact.''
   The market is still weak because of oversupply and high stock
levels, the experts said.
   The broker said ``the underlying trend is bearish at the
moment.''
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing
about 19 million barrels a day, MacLeaod said. That is far above
the ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a day agreed to by 12 of
OPEC's 13 members in an effort to support prices at $18 a barrel.

   The navy and air force battled each other in a
simulated nuclear and chemical war designed to test defense
capabilities, it was reported Monday.
   The two-hour mock battle was held late last month at an
undisclosed naval base in the East China Sea, the official People's
Daily said in its overseas edition.
   It did not say how many troops were involved in the exercise,
which began with the detonation of a simulated nuclear explosion.
Air force bombers then made simulated nuclear and chemical attacks
on the navy base, the newspaper said.
   It said the East Sea Fleet and base artillery units ``organized
effective firepower to counterattack'' and took protective action
against the radioactivity and chemicals, but it did not elaborate.
   China exploded its first atomic device in 1964 in the desert in
remote Xinjiang. It tested its first hydrogen bomb three years
later.
   It is believed to have half a dozen intercontinental ballistic
missiles with nuclear warheads and more than 100 medium-range
nuclear missiles.

   Attackers believed to be opposed to the expansion
of New Tokyo International Airport set fire to 29 construction
trucks, police said Monday.
   No injuries were reported in the pre-dawn arson attacks, which
were triggered by devices with timing mechanisms, police said.
   In one of the attacks at Ichikawa, Chiba, about 20 miles west of
the airport, a 6{-ton truck and three other smaller trucks were
burned, said Kaichi Sato, spokesman of the Chiba Prefectural
Police. The vehicles were owned by a firm involved in the
construction at Narita Airport, about 40 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   In another attack, also in Chiba, three 10-ton trucks and a
smaller truck were destroyed in a parking lot, police said.
Twenty-one trucks were burned in the four other attacks, all in
Chiba, they added.
   The incidents followed two similar attacks in Chiba and Ibaraki
prefectures on Friday when 12 vehicles were destroyed.
   Kyodo News Service reported Monday that the Chukaku-ha, a
leftist radical group, claimed responsibility for Friday's attacks.
   Radical opponents and some farmers have engaged in sporadic
clashes with police over the years to protest Narita Airport and
more recently the construction of two new runways.

   Violent storms often strike Lake Tanganyika without warning,

<HEAD>Sole Survivor Of Boxcar Tragedy An Outcast In Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only survivor among a group of aliens
locked in a railroad boxcar under the broiling desert sun says his
survival has made him an outcast in his hometown because people
blame him for the deaths.
   Among those bitter that Miguel Tostado Rodriguez survived while
18 others suffocated is the widow of Mario Garcia Alvarez,
Tostado's best friend.
   ``Mario and Miguel were like brothers, yet I blame Miguel for
Mario's death. I can't help it. He is to blame,'' Rosa Emma Puga
said.
   ``We all wanted someone or something to blame for the tragedy _
Miguel, the United States, the railroad, la migra (Border Patrol),
anything,'' she said.
   Tostado said many others in his hometown of Pabellon de Arteaga
in the central Mexican state of Aguascalientes are hostile.
   ``I am being blamed by the families of the men who died. They
want to know why I survived and their loved ones didn't. It's not
my fault I survived. What really hurts is that they hate me for
what happened,'' Tostado told the El Paso Times.
   Border Patrol officials say Tostado was not involved with the
smuggler who locked the men in the boxcar, but rumors persist in
Mexico that Tostado was working with the man, said Tostado's
mother, Socorro Tostado.
   ``People were out to get my son, even people he had known all
his life. They blame him for what happened,'' she said. ``Some of
the people told us they would not rest until they had avenged the
death of their relative. They said if they don't get Miguel,
they'll get one of us.''
   Tostado, 22, was the only man found alive on July 2, 1987, when
Border Patrol agents at Sierra Blanca checked the boxcar.
   The 19 men were seeking jobs in the United States. The man who
smuggled them across the border put them aboard a boxcar in El Paso
and closed and locked the door.
   The train was supposed to go to Fort Worth but was held back at
Sierra Blanca, 90 miles east of El Paso, sitting on a siding for
about 14 hours under the desert sun.
   Temperatures in the boxcar reached 130 degrees and 18 men
suffocated. Tostado survived by punching a breathing hole in the
floor with a railway spike.
   Tostado has special permission from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to work in the United States, and is free to
travel back and forth to Mexico.
   He returned to his hometown on April 2 and met in the mayor's
office with the families of the six men from Pabellon de Arteaga
who died. Tostado said he returned because he feared for his
family's safety.
   ``All I wanted was to see my family, but I was being warned
about the danger in going back. Mexican newspapers were saying I
was responsible for the deaths. But I had to confront the
situation. It was getting out of hand.''
   An El Paso psychologist said the hatred toward Tostado is not
surprising.
   ``In the U.S. it would be considered a great accomplishment that
Tostado managed to survive,'' said Guido Barrientos. ``But in
Mexico, the fact he is the only survivor is highly suspect. Why did
he survive, and not the others?
   Tostado said he doubts he will return to Mexico again.
   He is becoming comfortable in the United States. He's learning
English, and he says he likes this country more than his native
Mexico.
   ``The U.S. is a law-abiding country,'' Tostado said. ``I like
the orderly way of life in the United States. My country is too
much in disarray. Everything is for the government, nothing for the
people.
   ``I only hope (the smuggler) is caught one day, because he's
probably the only one who can vindicate me. I would love to learn
his whereabouts. I know for sure, however, that one of these days,
he will be caught. Then we shall learn the entire truth.
   ``Then people will know I'm not to blame.''

   About two dozen black ministers representing
some of the city's largest churches have stepped up their criticism
of City Manager Philip Hawkey for firing a black Community
Development Department official.
   The ministers said Sunday they would file a lawsuit against the
city in an attempt to suspend the city's share of U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development funds. The suit also would draw
attention to the ``unjust'' way blacks have been treated by the
city, they said.
   ``We are unified as never before,'' the Rev. Floyd Rose, pastor
of the Family Baptist Church, told about 350 people during a rally
at the St. Paul Baptist Church.
   He said civil rights leaders do not condone mismanagement, but
that Bernard ``Pete'' Culp, former renewal operations commissioner,
was not given a hearing to explain the problems in his department.
   Hawkey fired Culp on Friday, claiming he was responsible for
many of the housing program's deficiencies. Another black who was
director of the Community Development Department was demoted, to
special assistant.
   The Rev. Robert Culp, Bernard Culp's brother, told supporters
the ministers' lawyers would seek a preliminary injunction to shut
down the city's Community Development Department. The shutdown
would allow their lawyers to investigate how the city's has spent
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development funds since 1979.
   ``We have been saying the problems are larger than the issue of
community development. It goes into serious questions about the way
federal funds intended for minorites have been spent since 1979,''
said the Rev. Ronald Barnett, one of 13 civil rights leaders
arrested last week after refusing to leave Council chambers in
protest of the suspensions.
   Barnett said the present city administration has ``turned a deaf
ear when it comes to hiring and promoting minorities.''
   Mayor Donna Owens said Sunday she was concerned about the
response to the firing by Toledo's black community, and said she
would try to set up a meeting with the black ministers this week.
   A preliminary report released by the city Friday concentrated on
problems in the Community Development Department's home ownership
program, which receives the bulk of its money from the Department
of Housing and Urban Development.
   The report contends there were irregularities in grants awarded
to at least 50 people. It also said grants were awarded to people
who live outside the city, and that the city lent $29,000 to a man
so he could buy a home from Culp's son, William.
   A yearlong investigation of the city's housing programs by HUD
revealed deficiencies that included double-billing for some
improvements and failure of houses to meet city codes after being
rehabilitated.

   President Reagan said today U.S. warships will
remain in the Persian Gulf in the wake of a U.S. missile attack on
an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard.
   ``We want peace in the Gulf, but we also want the right of
navigation in international waters,'' Reagan told reporters upon
his return to the White House from a weekend at Camp David.
   Reagan said the downing of the plane was ``an understandable
accident.'' Asked whether he was concerned about possible Iranian
retaliation for the attack, he said, ``You have to think about that
knowing who they are.''
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty and a team of U.S. Navy
investigators started for the Middle East today to piece together
the facts behind the downing of the civilian aircraft.
   Meanwhile, an Iranian official said the action was ``an act of
terrorism'' that demanded revenge.
   Mohammad Ja-Afar Mahallati, Iranian ambassador to the United
Nations, said on the CBS ``This Morning'' program that the downing
of the jet was premeditated and he called it ``cold-blooded
murder.''
   ``By definition, it was an act of terrorism that ... should be
severely punished,'' he said.
   He added: ``We will not put any limit on our act of
self-defense. We will retaliate very strongly wherever we find
American interests.''
   Fogarty, the head of the U.S. team investigating the incident,
departed the United States this morning, but details of his
itinerary were not available, said Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a
Pentagon spokesman.
   Reagan promised a ``full investigation'' into still-unanswered
questions about the Persian Gulf tragedy.
   Reagan, who was scheduled to return to the White House today to
wrap up his July 4th holiday, issued a statement Sunday afternoon
saying ``our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers,
crew and their families.''
   But he strongly defended the missile attack early Sunday morning
by the cruiser USS Vincennes, saying the approaching jetliner
ignored warnings and the American ship ``followed standing orders
and widely publicized procedures, firing to protect itself against
possible attack.''
   The incident immediately provoked comparisons to the Soviet
destruction of a Korean Air Lines jetliner in 1983, an attack that
killed 269 people and led Reagan at the time to denounce ``the
barbarity of the Soviet government in shooting down an unarmed
plane'' after it veered into Soviet airspace.
   Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
rejected such comparisons, saying the Iranian airliner was flying
in a ``combat zone'' where Iran itself wages war.
   But numerous questions remain about how the mistake occurred,
including why the Navy's most sophisticated naval defense system
did not distinguish the large Airbus jetliner from Iran's much
smaller, U.S.-made F-14 attack fighters.
   Crowe said the Aegis defense system ``cannot defy the laws of
physics'' and that ``one of the most difficult problems is from a
radar blip, particularly from a head-on target, to identify the
type of aircraft.'' He also said the Vincennes' crew had only about
four minutes to make a decision after picking up the approaching
aircraft.
   Members of Congress are scheduled to end their July 4th holiday
on Wednesday, with the incident certain to renew debate over the
Reagan administration's policy of military deployment in the gulf.
   A White House official, asked whether the incident will force a
reassessment, responded, ``There is no change in policy.'' He
refused to be identified by name.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he would ``reserve judgment until receiving further
information.''
   Another member of the committee, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said
his initial impression was that U.S. forces acted appropriately,
but he added, ``I, too, have many unanswered questions.''
   Democratic presidential nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis, home in
Brookline, Mass., said, ``Plainly our armed forces have a right to
defend themselves when attacked.''
   He said, however, the downing of the plane is further evidence
that ``the war between Iran and Iraq must end. We and the
international community have a responsibility to stop it.''
   Dukakis' Republican counterpart, Vice President George Bush,
declined to comment Sunday while vacationing at his summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the plane was on a routine
150-mile flight between Iran's coastal city of Bandar Abbas and
Dubai, located across the Strait of Hormuz in the United Arab
Emirates. It said the airliner was hit by two U.S. missiles and
that all aboard were presumed dead.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, denounced the action as ``new
evidence of American crimes and mischiefs.''
   Crowe acknowledged the incident at a midday Pentagon briefing on
Sunday, hours after an erroneous initial Pentagon report that the
Vincennes had shot down an Iranian F-14 while skirmishing with
Iranian gunboats.
   Iran Air flight 655 was destroyed on the second of two days of
fighting between Iran and the United States on oil lanes through
the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. No American
casualties were reported in the exchanges.
   Reagan, who was informed of the developments while vacationing
at his Camp David, Md., retreat, said, ``The Defense Department
will conduct a full investigation.''
   While he defended the decision to fire on the airliner, he
called the outcome a ``terrible human tragedy.''
   At his briefing, Crowe said the two Standard surface-to-air
missiles were fired before the airliner was sighted, but that
eyewitnesses did see the craft ``disintegrate'' in mid-air about
six miles from the Vincennes.
   Crowe defended the Vincennes' commander, Capt. Will C. Rogers
III. He said Rogers believed his ship was in jeopardy and thought
the incoming aircraft was an F-14, the most lethal plane owned by
Iran.
   In the aftermath of the Iraqi attack on the USS Stark in the
gulf in May 1987, U.S. military commanders in the region were
placed under new rules of engagement requiring them to take faster
defensive action when threatened.
   Crowe expressed ``deep regret'' over the loss of life but said
Rogers and other commanders in the area ``acted with good
judgment'' because they believed American ships were being
approached by a hostile aircraft.
   The Vincennes is a San Diego-based, 9,600-ton Aegis class
cruiser that has been on patrol in the strategic Hormuz area for
the past month, under Reagan's policy of offering U.S. protection
to neutral shipping in the gulf. It is equipped with an array of
sophisticated radar and missiles, including the SM-2 Standard, a
long-range, anti-aircraft weapon.
   Crowe said the aircraft approached the Vincennes four or five
miles outside a commercial corridor used by civilian craft in the
area.
   A U.S. officer who just returned from six months in the gulf
said, however, that commercial planes in the region have
``continued to fly as though they were oblivious to what was going
on around them.''
   ``I don't think they got the word,'' Rear Admiral R.G. Zeller
said in San Diego.
   Crowe said the Iranian airliner dropped in altitude and
accelerated to about 450 knots, as a warplane would do if preparing
to fire an anti-ship missile.
   Those actions and electronic transmissions ``led us to believe
it was a military aircraft,'' he said.
   Before firing the missiles, Crowe said, the U.S. warship ``sent
three warnings on a civilian distress network and four warnings on
a military distress network.''
   The Iranian aircraft ``neither answered nor changed its
course,'' he said.

<HEAD>Noted Cemetery Faces Complaints Of Poor Maintenance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery, the final
resting place of such stars as Rudolph Valentino and Tyrone Power,
has become an eyesore of overgrown grass and damaged mausoleums,
critics charge.
   State officials say it has prompted more complaints in the past
five years than any other California cemetery. Relatives of those
buried at the 57-acre memorial park complain of vandalism, unkempt
grounds and leaky mausoleum roofs.
   ``We've averaged about six to eight letters per year and more
phone calls than I'd care to recall,'' said John Gill, executive
secretary of the state Cemetery Board, which oversees more than 200
cemeteries.
   Last year, heirs of makeup artist Max Factor, who was entombed
in 1938, transferred his remains and those of other relatives to
another cemetery.
   The cemetery, founded in 1899, bears the remains of such stars
as Janet Gaynor, Peter Lorre, Tyrone Power, Douglas Fairbanks Sr.,
Rudolph Valentino and director Cecil B. DeMille among its 73,000
graves, crypts and niches. Tourist maps point out the noted resting
places.
   By law, cemeteries must invest some of their earnings in an
endowment care fund and spend the interest for upkeep. Hollywood
Memorial had $143,568 in interest last year, according to cemetery
board records.
   But Gill and others said even twice that much would be
insufficient to restore the cemetery's former glamour.
   Lack of money is ``a universal problem among older cemeteries.
Some just happen to be harder hit than others,'' he said.
   Yet Hollywood Memorial remains profitable and has done its best
to keep up appearances, said principal owner Jules F. Roth.
   ``For someone buried here in 1901, $5 went into a perpetual care
fund,'' Roth said. ``Now you tell me, how much income can you get
from $5? But we still have to take care of that grave ... We do the
best we can with what we've got.''
   In 1984, Roth was called before the Cemetery Board to answer
complaints about poor maintenance. The board cannot impose
sanctions, however.
   ``It's a disgrace what's happened over there,'' said Minni
Schoenburg, 70, whose parents are buried in the Beth Olam Jewish
section of the grounds.
   ``Eight years ago I was humiliated when we buried my mother and
the grass was a foot high around the other graves,'' she said.
   The cemetery has faced other problems recently. Vandals have
struck several times, once overturning or desecrating 114
tombstones in one night. A stained glass window was taken from a
mausoleum but later recovered, and a woman's head was taken from a
crypt and found outside the cemetery. Two men were convicted of
desecrating the remains.
   Yet for some, the cemetery retains a special ambiance.
   ``Sure, it may have seen better days, but that antiquated, kind
of grown-over feeling you get when you enter is what makes it a
storybook kind of place,'' said Frank Cooper, who conducts an
annual tour of the grounds for the Art Deco Society.

   The man who trained dolphins for the television
series ``Flipper'' and tamed Orca the killer whale is going to
China to help save the rare Chinese river dolphin from extinction.
   The freshwater dolphins _ called ``baiji'' _ once flourished in
China's rivers and lakes, but pollution and river traffic have
reduced their numbers.
   Fewer than 300 are left in the Yangtze River.
   Ric O'Barry, 48, is leaving this month for a monthlong
fact-finding trip. He says getting the Chinese government to
understand what it will take to save the baiji from extinction may
be half the battle.
   The Chinese plan to build a semi-natural preserve by closing off
a loop of the river. Then O'Barry hopes to capture as many of the
dolphins as possible and move them to the preserve.
   ``They have to be taken to this place, settle down, fall in love
and start making babies,'' O'Barry said. ``We're talking about
re-populating the species, and that could take many years.''
   O'Barry said moving the dolphins could be as dangerous as
leaving them in the river, unless it's done right.
   Keeping dolphins calm during jolting moves in trucks or
helicopters is vital because they don't breathe automatically,
O'Barry said. ``Any time they want to end their life they simply
don't take the next breath.''
   Since marine mammal husbandry is practically an unknown field in
China, O'Barry also hopes to communicate his love for the playful
dolphins to the Chinese.
   ``They need to be as careful as they can and build a beautiful
spot for them to survive,'' he said. ``It's the same problem they
had with the panda. Until they got worldwide exposure, no one knew
about the problem.''
   O'Barry is borrowing $3,000 from his son's college fund to make
the trip, and is looking for a corporate sponsor for the baiji
project.
   ``The Chinese government is not putting much money into this,''
O'Barry said. ``Not that they don't care _ they're just overwhelmed
by human problems.''
   Chinese scientists have been studying several wounded baiji they
nursed back to health in a tank. But capturing and moving an entire
population was beyond their expertise and their budget, O'Barry
said. Dr. Xhou Kaiya, dean of Nanjing Normal University, contacted
him in hopes of leading a worldwide effort to save the species.
   As a trainer at Miami's Seaquarium in the 1960s, O'Barry taught
five dolphins to play the part of Flipper on TV. But to hear
O'Barry tell it, the dolphins were the ones training him.
   ``Dolphins are far more intelligent in our world than we are in
theirs,'' O'Barry said. ``It's taken about 25 years, but I can see
things from their point of view.''
   Through the Dolphin Project, O'Barry has spent years lobbying
marine animal shows and other organizations to release captive
dolphins into the wild. He admits that his solution to the baiji's
predicament _ isolating them in a manmade preserve _ is sadly
ironic.
   ``It's like the pandas,'' he said. ``The only ones to survive
will be born in captivity. It's either that or let them become
extinct.''

   Henry Kissinger was shocked. George Bush had
been a loyal soldier as chairman of the Republican National
Committee in the aftermath of Watergate, and now in late 1974
President Ford was offering a choice of glittering rewards: London
or Paris.
   No thanks, Bush said. How about the ambassadorship to China?
   ``When Henry heard I'd turned down the ambassador's posts in
London and Paris in order to go to Beijing, he was baffled,'' Bush
wrote in his memoirs. ``There'll be some substantive work from time
to time,'' Bush remembered Kissinger as saying, ``but for the most
part you'll be bored beyond belief.''
   Kissinger may have been right. According to Bush and several
people who worked with him those 13 months, the U.S. Liaison
Mission in Beijing was set up in the early 1970s to exist, not to
do anything in particular.
   Kissinger himself handled the tricky diplomacy. There were few
bilateral cultural, military or economic ties and there wasn't much
of a social whirl _ not at a time when Chinese leaders were still
wary of the West. Bush's predecessor, David Bruce, rarely left the
U.S. compound.
   Boring or not, the time Bush spent in Beijing and as U.S.
representative to the United Nations from 1971 to 1973 gave him
something rare on a presidential resume: service as an ambassador.
Only former President William Howard Taft came close with service
as governor general of the Philippines.
   Bush, now set to become the Republican presidential nominee,
became a member of the diplomatic set in 1970 after he lost a
Senate race in Texas to Democrat Lloyd Bentsen. The consolation
prize was an appointment to the United Nations by President Nixon,
who took a lot of heat for putting a diplomatic rookie like Bush in
the prestigious post.
   The major controversy during Bush's tenure was the fight over
Chinese membership in the world body.
   Kissinger and Nixon, eager to foster good relations with China
without appearing to abandon longstanding allies in Taiwan, favored
``dual representation'' that would permit both Chinas to stay.
   Bush lobbied for dual representation, but on Oct. 25, 1971, the
proposal was defeated by the U.N. General Assembly and Taiwan was
expelled.
   Bush said later that when he left the United Nations in January
1973 to head the Republican National Committee he was more critical
of the world body than he had been before, having seen its ``flaws
and limitations first hand.''
   In September 1974, Bush, his wife Barbara, and their newly
acquired cocker spaniel, C. Fred Bush, headed for Beijing where
they spent the next year and a month living in a walled compound
guarded by green-uniformed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.
   ``The PLA guards were really there to keep an eye on us and to
make sure no Chinese people could get in to talk to us,'' a member
of Bush's Beijing staff said in a recent interview. The diplomat,
who still works in the U.S. government, spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``I remember one time a U.S. ambassador to another country came
to visit and the guards wouldn't let the ambassador's wife into the
compound because she was Asian _ they wouldn't believe she wasn't a
Chinese citizen,'' the diplomat said.
   ``Bush found out about it and went crazy. He called up the
foreign ministry and demanded an apology. I think if he had an
AK-47 he would have gone down there and shot up the ministry. It
was the only time I saw him lose his temper.''
   According to the diplomat and others who worked on Bush's staff,
including John Holdridge, the deputy chief of mission, there was
little contact between American diplomats in Beijing and the
Chinese government.
   For one thing, it was not until the Carter administration that
full diplomatic relations were exchanged. And in the waning days of
Mao Tse-tung, Chinese officials cautious about the succession were
not eager to stick their necks out and become friendly with any
Western diplomats, much less Americans.
   ``We were very much isolated,'' said Holdridge, who later became
ambassador to Indonesia. ``We tried to keep busy, to make contacts
and to carry on diplomacy, but there was very little interraction
with the Chinese.''
   ``It was tough duty,'' said Peter Bergin, a member of the
mission staff. ``There really wasn't very much to do.''
   By all accounts, Bush spent much of the time improving his
already-good tennis skills. He played on courts at Beijing's
International Club with other diplomats and a ``club pro'' provided
by the Chinese government.
   The envoy and his wife also spent hours cycling through the
dusty and windy streets of Beijing, drawing stares from Chinese
citizens unaccustomed to Westerners. The sight of Bush's dog was
also a novelty in a country where canine was as common on a menu as
on a leash.
   ``Bush used the time very wisely, in a political sense.'' the
diplomat who spoke privately said. ``In those days, it was nearly
impossible to get a visa to visit China, but you could get around
it by getting an invitation from the head of the liaison office.
   ``Bush used it like a political plum and there was a steady
stream of important visitors from the States. It was his way of
keeping his hand in U.S. politics.''
   Bush wrote that one of the highlights of his tour was a meeting
with Mao, who lived in seclusion and died the next year.
   ``I am going to heaven soon,'' Bush quoted Mao as saying. ``I
have already received an invitation from God.''
   Bush soon got an invitation too. Ford asked him to run the
Central Intelligence Agency and his diplomatic career was over.

   When talk show host Phil Donahue razed an
experimental, all-concrete house recently, the architect accused
him of betraying his nickname ``Mr. Sensitivity.'' But Donahue
isn't the only one swinging the wrecking ball these days on
Connecticut's ``Gold Coast.
   The rising value of land along this area of Long Island Sound 45
miles from New York City has encouraged property owners to tear
down older buildings, said Lucinda McWeeney, who is using a $25,000
federal grant to identify Westport's cultural resources, buildings
and sites.
   Within one recent two-week period, she said, the town of about
26,000 received applications for the demolition of six buildings,
four of which are historically or architecturally significant.
   ``We're finding people who aren't necessarily natives of
Westport but are interested in the economic value of property are
tearing down what we feel are significant structures,'' McWeeney
said. ``And it's not just in Westport. It's happening throughout
Fairfield County.''
   Donahue raised the hackles of preservationists last month when
he had the 26-year-old house torn down. Designed by internationally
known architect John M. Johansen, the house was described by some
as the town's most architecturally significant.
   Oak boards were used as forms in building the house, so that the
concrete walls had the texture of wood, including knots. The walls
were extended above the flat roof; some rooms were lined with
silken wall coverings.
   When he learned that the house had been razed, Johansen said,
``This wasn't a very exemplary act from a public figure. And
they've nicknamed him `Mr. Sensitivity.'''
   Donahue, who bought the house and 7.2 acres of land around it
for $6.8 million several months ago, said he wanted more space,
privacy and security for his wife, actress Marlo Thomas, and their
family.
   He said the house, which adjoined their property and had been
vacant for some time, had become a hostel for ``vagrants, lovers
and other strangers'' and denied that he wanted to improve the view
of Long Island Sound from his mansion. Donahue and Miss Thomas live
in a $3.5 million Tudor-style home on 3.1 acres overlooking the
sound.
   McWeeney said Westport, which is also home to actor Paul Newman
and his wife, actress Joanne Woodward, has changed drastically in
the last 20 years.
   ``It used to be a community of local artists and business men
who commuted to New York. Now it has turned into an office park,''
she said.
   ``Small local business can't afford to open here. They're
closing schools because young families can't afford to live here,''
McWeeney added.
   Her emphasis, she said, is on persuading developers to be
sensitive to local concerns about preservation before undertaking a
project.
   ``They have individual property owner rights, but we have visual
rights,'' she said.
   There are some protections for older buildings in Westport.
   The town, McWeeney said, has two local historic districts, which
means the exteriors of the buildings in those areas are protected
from change by state statute, and three districts on the National
Register of Historic Places. The historic districts include
18th-century and 19th-century residential buildings, some of which
are are now used for commercial purposes.
   In addition, Westport has a demolition delay ordinance, which
protects buildings older than 50 years and larger than 500 square
feet from immediate demolition. Those buildings can't be razed for
at least 90 days from the time of application.
   Will Tressler, a member of a citizens group in Easton, said that
town also is encountering development ``done without regard for the
character of the surroundings.''
   The Citizens for Easton organization, he said, is going to ask
the town of about 6,000 people about 8 miles northeast of Westport
to establish a design review board that would evaluate plans for
new development in terms of its effect on the character of the
surrounding area.

   The shuttle Discovery made its
long-delayed trip to the launch pad Monday, a milestone in the
rebirth of America's space program that was hailed by workers who
streamed by the pad in an 18-mile-long line of cars.
   ``America, the dream is still alive,'' astronaut Dave Hilmers
told an earlier crowd of 2,000 space center employees who cheered
as the 85-ton spaceship rode a giant tracked transporter out of an
assembly building into the glare of spotlights at 12:50 a.m.
   Seven hours later, Discovery was perched on Launch Pad 39B, to
be readied for an early September liftoff, the first since the
Challenger disaster 2{ years ago.
   Then the space center gates were opened to permit engineers,
technicians, managers, secretaries and others here to bring their
families out on the Fourth of July holiday to view the spectacle.
   Security officials reported more than 4,000 cars came through,
and at times the line stretched to 18 miles and the drive to the
pad took nearly two hours. But no one seemed to mind once they got
there and viewed Discovery, standing majestically, glistening in
the blazing morning sun.
   A large sign at the pad gate proclaimed: ``America's Pride...The
Journey Continues.''
   As the cars drove by the pad, they slowed and cameras protruded
from windows and sunroofs. Many, mostly children, waved small
American flags.
   Reporters asked the drivers how they felt about once again
seeing a shuttle on the pad, and the replies were unvarying in
their enthusiasm: ``Wonderful''; ``It's great''; ``We're back in
business''; ``Very Fourth of July.''
   Two major hurdles remain before Discovery can be certified to
fly.
   A 19.4-second firing of the spaceship's three main liquid fuel
engines is set for July 24, with the shuttle locked firmly on the
launch pad. This will test scores of modifications made to the
powerplant and will provide the launch team with valuable countdown
practice.
   The following day, a final pre-flight firing of the shuttle's
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket is scheduled at the Morton
Thiokol plant in Utah.
   A faulty booster rocket seal allowed flame to escape and trigger
the explosion that doomed Challenger and its seven-person crew 73
seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Forrest S. McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center
presented Hilmers, one of Discovery's five crewmen, with a book
containing the signatures of more than 15,000 space center workers
who have labored to return the shuttle to space.
   Hilmers said the Discovery crew will carry the book into orbit
and will return it to the workers.
   ``You haven't given this book, this shuttle, just to the five
members of the crew,'' he said. ``Indeed, you've given it to all
America.
   ``It kind of brings tears to your eyes after so long a time of
struggling and looking at ourselves inwardly and outwardly, and
here it is; it's finally a reality,'' Hilmers said. ``What more
fitting present can we make to our country than this on the day of
its birthday.''
   Four launch dates for Discovery, starting last February, have
been scheduled and postponed, with NASA announcing the latest delay
last week, a slip from late August to early September.
   Astronaut Rick Hauck heads an all-veteran crew of shuttle fliers
who will fly the four-day Discovery mission, whose main purpose is
to deploy a communications satellite and test more than 200
modifications made to orbiter systems. The other crew members are
pilot Dick Covey and mission specialists Mike Lounge, George Nelson
and Hilmers.

   Hundreds of Israeli
Arabs, many dressed in white prayer robes, crossed this Israeli
checkpoint into Jordan on Monday during the annual pilgrimage to
Mecca.
   About 5,000 Moslems from Israel will make the pilgrimage, or
``hajj,'' this month, the highest number since 1977, when Saudi
Arabia first permitted Israeli Arabs to visit Mecca, the holy city
of Islam in Saudi Arabia.
   But the Arab uprising has reduced the number of pilgrims from
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to 1,300, down 75 percent
from last year. Palestinians blamed lower incomes following a rash
of strikes and additional exit restrictions imposed by Israel to
quell the uprising, in which 215 Palestinians and four Israelis
have died.
   ``It hurts my heart that so many of my brothers cannot go this
year,'' said Ali Mohammed Jaber, 35, from the Israeli Arab village
of Taibeh. ``I will pray for them and for peace everywhere in the
Moslem world.''
   Jaber, dressed in a white robe and prayer cap, spoke in the
parking lot of the Allenby Bridge checkpoint, where about 25 buses
carrying pilgrims waited to make the crossing into Jordan.
   Around him, other white-robed pilgrims stood amid their
belongings to prepare for a last security check. The parking lot
was filled with suitcases, bedrolls, and plastic yellow shopping
baskets filled with Arab pita bread and olives.
   In one corner of the lot, Israeli officials and Arab dignitaries
held a brief ceremony to send off the pilgrims.
   Zvulun Orlev, the director-general of the Religious Affairs
Ministry, cited Israel's religious tolerance and reminded the
audience of religious persecution suffered by Jews.
   He also said this year's pilgrimage was overshadowed by last
year's riots in Mecca that ``demanded a high price in blood and
desecrated the most sacred site of Islam.''
   More than 400 people, most of them Iranians Moslems, were killed
and hundreds injured in the clashes between Iranian pilgrims and
Saudi security personnel. The Saudis accused the Iranians of
holding demonstrations, including anti- U.S. protests, in defiance
of a ban on political activity.
   In April, Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic relations with
Tehran, citing terrorism and subversion.
   ``I'm lucky I wasn't there last year,'' said Abed Gunna, 49,
from Taibeh, who is embarking on his third hajj. ``But I'm not
worried about my safety this time.''
   Religious Affairs Ministry officials said three doctors were
accompanying the pilgrims, partly to ensure medical care in case of
renewed clashes.
   The Israeli Arab pilgrims leave for Mecca during a three-day
period ending Wednesday and must return by early August.
   According to the Moslem lunar calendar, the pilgrimage month is
expected to begin July 14. The high point of the hajj should fall
on July 22.
   Pilgrims must get special permits to pass through Jordan. Both
Jordan and Saudi Arabia are technically at war with Israel.
   Israeli officials barred pilgrims from returning with more than
$1,200 to block the flow of funds that might be used to finance the
nearly 7-month-old uprising, Israel radio reported.
   Udi Bahat, a spokesman for the Religious Affairs Ministry, said
the number of Israeli Arab pilgrims was up 20 percent from last
year. He cited as reasons for the increase the Islamic revival in
the Middle East and the fact that Israel this year reduced the
minimum age for pilgrims from 35 to 30.
   However, under the age restrictions, those between 16 and 36 who
go to Jordan are ordered to stay there for nine months before
returning. The measure was adopted several months ago to try to
prevent messages from being passed to and from members of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.

<HEAD>Mideast Countries Race To Arm Themselves With Longer Range
Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even before the United States downed an
Iranian airliner with a Navy missile, a number of nations in the
Mideast had stepped up efforts to strengthen their military might
by obtaining long-range ballistic missiles, according to a study
done by the Congressional Research Service.
   ``The pace of ballistic missile proliferation has quickened
considerably,'' said Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., who sought the
study.
   Ballistic missiles are weapons that leave the earth's atmosphere
and then fall back. They have longer ranges and capability to carry
a much larger warhead than short-range missiles like the one that
felled the Iranian airliner.
   ``Clearly, these pose a threat to U.S. and allied peace keeping
efforts in the Persian Gulf, the Middle East, and the Far East,''
said Quayle.
   The study did not address the problem of short-range missiles,
which have also been proliferating, particularly in the Mideast. It
was a short-range Standard missile that was used by the Navy to
shoot down the Iranian Airbus early Sunday.
   The study noted that China has been aggressively exporting its
missile technology, particularly in the Middle East.
   Until recently, most nations in the area didn't have ballistic
missiles. Israel already has in its arsenal the Jericho I and
Jericho II, two medium-range weapons.
   But, the study noted, Saudi Arabia has agreed to purchase
Chinese ``East Wind'' missiles, a weapon with a 2,700-kilometer
range that could be an eventual threat to Israel. The deal was kept
from U.S. intelligence agencies for two years, until the weapons
were installed.
   A number of other countries in the region are also joining the
ballistic missile club, the CRS said. It cited Egypt, which is
developing the 800-kilometer range Condor II missile in conjunction
with Brazil, and is also acquiring the modified SCUD-B, a
Soviet-developed missile also used by Iraq and North Korea. Egypt
said the Condor II is needed to offset the Israeli Jericho.
   A version of the SCUD is also being used by Iran, the study
said. Both Iran and Iraq have fired SCUDS at each other's capitals
in the ``war of the cities'' that is part of the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   In addition, both nations have the Chinese-built Silkworm
missiles, which have a large warhead but which are not particularly
accurate.
   Libya is also trying to develop missiles, according to the
study. The regime of Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy has offered
Brazil $2 billion to help develop a whole new family of short- and
medium-range ballistic missiles and has also tried to buy the
weapons from China. In addition, Libyans are working on a
home-grown missile with a 500-kilometer range. A test facility has
been built in the desert near Tauwiwa, the CRS said.
   Syria also may be near having a ballistic missile, the study
said. The Syrians reportedly are trying to buy China's M-9, a
600-kilometer weapon that would hit most points in Israel. The M-9
is being tested by the Chinese and the deal is not yet final, the
study said.
   In Latin America, Argentina and Brazil have both taken steps to
upgrade their missile arsenals in the past year, the CRS said.
   Brazil, besides discussing the development deal with Libya, is
working on yet another variant of the SCUD-B, which would have a
300-mile range, and is also working on the Sonda IV. That missile
would give the Brazilians the capability to launch their own space
satellites by 1990, the study said.
   Argentina is working on the Condor II with the Eygptians and
also dealing with the Chinese on a joint version of a
1,500-kilometer range weapon.
   The Condor II would have enough range to reach the Falkland
Islands, where there has been a large contingent of British troops
ever since the 1982 war between the two nations over the remote
territory. Argentina claims the islands, which it calls the
Malvinas.
   The CRS review also noted that Pakistan and India, two long-time
enemies, have escalated their competition in the ballistic missile
arena. The two nations have fought three wars since the countries
were created by the 1947 partitioning of the British colony.
   India has successfully tested a 250-kilometer missile, the
Prithvi, which is the country's first ballistic missile designed
solely for the military. In addition, the Indians are nearing
completion of an advanced space launch missile that would have an
intercontinental range.
   Pakistan recently tested a missile with a range of up to 1,000
kilometers and the capability to carry a nuclear warhead, the study
said. Pakistan has denied that it is building atomic weapons, but
nuclear non-proliferation officials say the country is developing a
nuclear capability.

   Bartolomeu Simoes Pereira, the planning
minister of Guinea-Bissau who drew up a major economic
restructuring program for the West African nation, was killed
Monday in a car crash, according to a news report.
   Simoes Pereira, 40, was killed in a crash 17 miles north of the
capital, Bissau, as he returned from visiting his family, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa said in a report from the West African
country.
   Guinea-Bissau police and medical authorities made no statement
on the cause of the accident, but Lusa quoted unidentified
unofficial sources as saying it was believed a tire on his car blew
out and caused the accident.
   Simoes Pereira had been planning minister for the past four
years. He had drawn up a program backed by the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank to revive the poverty-stricken
country's economy.

   Record companies borrow from him,
publicists consult with him and even ol' Blue Eyes himself has made
a request or two.
   Ric Ross, a 50-year-old financial consultant from this Ventura
County town, has undoubtedly the world's most extensive collection
of Frank Sinatra records and memorabilia.
   ``I'm certain that Ric Ross knows more about me than I do
myself,'' the 72-year-old Sinatra said recently through a
spokesman. ``I'm flattered by the attention he's shown my career.''
   Ross, a collector since 1956, has every foreign and domestic
album Sinatra ever recorded _ more than 2,000 discs, some 600
reel-to-reel tape recordings of live performances, at least 400
concerts and movies on video, and files full of articles and
schedules.
   In 1965, Ross helped compile a two-record set for Sinatra's
recording label, Reprise, titled ``Frank Sinatra: A Man and His
Music.''
   When Sinatra announced his retirement in 1971, he asked Ross to
compile on tape all of the songs he had done, in chronological
order. The package was delivered in less than a month.
   Ross estimates his collection, spread across a spare bedroom and
part of the garage, is worth between $250,000 and $500,000.
   ``He's more than a fan; he's a Sinatra historian,'' said Dorothy
Uhlemann, Sinatra's personal assistant of 21 years. ``When we have
a question we just call Ric, and most of the time he can just
rattle off the answer.''
   Ross, who receives regular invitations to Sinatra's concerts,
called the singer a musical genius.
   ``I just never get tired of listening to him,'' he said.

   She was known as Little Eva in her heyday
as a rock 'n' roll singer, but these days Eva Harris is hoping to
record a gospel album.
   ``You come to a place in your life that you find out some things
in life are counterfeit,'' Ms. Harris said in a telephone interview
last week.
   ``I needed something real. Christ is real,'' she said.
   Twenty-five years ago, Little Eva hit the top of the record
charts with ``The Locomotion.'' It was a good time for the teen-age
singer, but the years that followed turned her bitter toward the
rock 'n' roll industry.
   ``I enjoyed myself. I enjoyed singing,'' said the 44-year-old
Ms. Harris.
   But, she said, the experience was spoiled by people who she said
made commitments but didn't keep them. She never made any money
from her hit song, she said, except for $50 and expenses.
   She returned to North Carolina after her mother died in 1971.
While singing with a church gospel group, she said she discovered
Christianity.
   Recently, she sang at a gospel concert.
   ``Hey, I can still do it,'' she said. ``I'm not even going to
think it won't happen because it will. It's what you call faith.''

   Queen Margrethe II of Denmark has
opened the first solo art exhibition of her own works _ including
costume designs for a play by Hans Christian Andersen.
   ``It is like being to an exam,'' the B.T. newspaper quoted her
as saying as she opened the exhibition Sunday at Koege Art Museum.
   It was the first exhibit at the museum's new sketch department
which was opened as part of the 700th anniversary of Koege, a city
about 24 miles south of Copenhagen.
   ``I have opened many exhibitions, but I have never experienced
anything like what is happening today,'' the queen said.
   Besides the costume designs, the queen's art work from 1970 to
1988 included abstract oil paintings, illustrations for a Danish
edition of J.R.R. Tolkien's ``Lord of the Rings,'' stamps and
church textiles.
   The queen, 48, previously exhibited her work under a pseudonym.

   The son of actor Anthony Quinn was slightly
injured when an allegedly drunken driver rear-ended Quinn's
motorcycle, police said.
   Lorenzo Quinn, 22, and Iluna Margolis, 21, were stopped in
Hollywood when the car struck the motorcycle Sunday afternoon, said
police Officer Charles Garcia.
   The riders, who were not wearing helmets, suffered only minor
injuries. Quinn, an actor from New York, was treated at the scene
for cuts and bruises to his head and lower back, Garcia said.
   ``They were very lucky. It was a miracle they weren't killed,''
added Garcia. The motorcycle was damaged beyond repair, he said.
   The driver of the car, identified as John Leitch, 39, was booked
for investigation of felony drunk driving, Garcia said.
   Quinn is the son of Academy Award-winning actor Anthony Quinn,
who starred in such films as ``Zorba the Greek'' and ``Viva
Zapata!''

   A group of 19 Soviet missile
specialists arrived Monday to verify compliance with the superpower
treaty scrapping intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Another group of Soviet specialists arrived in the United States
last week, while American inspectors went to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets who arrived in Frankfurt will carry out inspections
of missile sites in West Germany.
   Vladimir A. Akimenkov, head of one team, opened his statement
with good wishes for Americans on the Fourth of July.
   ``We congratulate you on the occasion of Independence Day,''
Akimenkov said through an interpreter.
   ``Our team has arrived today to conduct inspection outlined by
the INF treaty,'' Akimenkov said. ``It's an important milestone in
relations between our countries.''
   He added that the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty would
contribute to ``saving mankind from the nuclear holocaust.''
   Alimenkov, speaking to reporters at the U.S. Rhein-Main Air
Base, did not specify where the Soviet inspectors were heading, in
keeping with treaty regulations.
   Missile specialists, according to the treaty, are not allowed to
identify inspection sites until four hours after their arrival,
said U.S. Navy Capt. James Connell of the Washington-based On-site
Inspection Agency, which was established to implement the
inspection provisions of the treaty.
   The Soviets were welcomed by U.S. Air Force Col. David Williams
and Col. Onno Oldig of the West German armed forces.
   Earlier, the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart said the Soviets
will conduct a ``baseline inspection'' of facilities and equipment
based in Germany, which means they will establish the guide, or
``baseline,'' on what's there on paper and what's actually there.
   The inspections are the first type to be made under the treaty.
   ``Baseline inspections are not very complicated. We're basically
talking about counting and measuring. It's basicially taking
inventory,'' a U.S. Air Force spokesman in Frankfurt told The
Associated Press. He requested anonymity.
   There are six sites in West Germany that would be subject to
inspection under the treaty.
   West German Army officials in Stuttgart said they expect the
Soviets on Tuesday. The inspectors likely will visit Pershing
missile sites in Schwaebish Gmuend near Stuttgart, the officials
said in a statement.
   The American inspectors in the Soviet Union will verify
destruction of 1,800 missiles and check on about 3,200 related
components, including storage and transport missile containers and
special hauling vehicles.

<HEAD>Most Governments Blame Iran-Iraq War for Downing of Jetliner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES L. WATSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said Monday the U.S. Navy was
``trigger-happy,'' but most governments appeared to view the
downing of an Iranian jetliner as the kind of tragedy made
inevitable by eight years of war between Iran and Iraq.
   Arab nations in the Persian Gulf renewed their call for an end
to the conflict that has turned the entire waterway into a war zone.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, U.N. secretary-general, said the
destruction of the jet Sunday by the U.S. guided missile cruiser
Vincennes ``appears to have been a tragic error.'' All 290 people
aboard were killed.
   He asked for ``the greatest restraint in these difficult moments
for the peace and security of the region.'' His statement was read
to reporters after Perez de Cuellar met in Geneva with Iranian
Ambassador Sirous Nasseri.
   Vatican radio called it an ``absurd tragedy'' in which innocent
people paid ``the price of a never-ending conflict that has already
sowed so much death and destruction. ... The possibility of tragic
errors, that add themselves to the destructive iniquities of war,
is particulary worrisome.''
   Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
said the incident ``shows American naval officers were not very
competent, or to use an American phrase, trigger-happy.''
   He said it proved American actions in the region were dangerous
and demanded: ``U.S. naval forces must immediately leave the waters
of the Persian Gulf.''
   According to the U.S. Defense Department, the Vincennes mistook
the Airbus for an Iranian F-14 fighter and the plane did not
respond to radio warnings.
   Another Soviet official said privately that the tragedy
strengthened the Soviet position that a U.N.-sponsored
international peacekeeping force should replace U.S. forces in the
gulf.
   Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Soviet
Union have warships and mine clearance units in and near the gulf.
The United States has deployed more than two dozen vessels in the
largest national contingent.
   Citing the downing by Soviet fighters Sept. 1, 1983, of a South
Korean jetliner, in which all 269 people aboard were killed,
Gerasimov said the Korean plane was over a ``strategically
sensitive'' area of the Soviet Far East while the Iranian jet was
``flying only over its own territory and territorial waters.''
   The Soviet Union denounces Sunday's attack but will not follow
the ``bad example'' of ``wild'' American criticism after the event
in 1983, he said.
   Kuwait, which Iran accuses of being Iraq's ally in the war,
issued an ``urgent appeal'' for and end to the fighting and
predicted ``more painful incidents'' if it continues.
   Abu Dhabi's official newspaper Al-Ittihad Airbus passengers and
crew ``were the victims of the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war,'' and said
the disaster ``might be repeated.''
   Gulf News, an English language paper published in Dubai, the
plane's destination, called the incident the ``worst ever in the
region in recent times.''
   Dubai's other English-language daily, the Khaleej Times, said:
``Why the plane was permitted to take off when there was a naval
engagement in the area must remain a mystery and has yet to be
fully explained. How the Americans failed to distinguish between an
Airbus and an F-14 despite their sophisticated equipment is an
equal mystery.''
   The Vincennes had sunk two Iranian attack boats and damaged a
third just before the plane took off from Bandar Abbas, Iran, on
the short hop to Dubai.
   A Qatar daily, the Gulf Times, said continuing of the conflict
was ``senseless.''
   Bahrain's Akhbar al-Khaleej said editorially: ``If there is a
lesson to be gained from this tragedy, it is that the gulf war must
stop immediately.''
   Greece put the onus on the United States, but Washington's
allies in Europe generally used the occasion to call for an end to
the Iran-Iraq war, which began in September 1980.
   In Athens, government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said: ``This
tragic event ... is an international responsibility of the United
States. The parties involved must display above all calmness and
self-restraint. ... Only this way will it be posible to find the
real reasons for the airliner's downing and attribute
responsibilities.''
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany said on
a visit to Seoul, South Korea: ``This tragic event proves the
necessity of all efforts to contribute to peace in the region by
adhering to U.N. Security Council Resolution 598,'' which was
adopted unanimously a year ago and calls for a cease-fire in the
war.
   Britain has accepted the U.S. explanation of the event. Italy
said a special Cabinet meeting will be held Friday to discuss the
Persian Gulf situation.
   Switzerland, which handles U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran,
sent condolences to Tehran but would not say whether it had
forwarded a formal Iranian protest to Washington. Foreign Ministry
spokesman Michel Pache said Switzerland's policy of providing good
offices required discretion about its activities.
   Japan, which gets slightly more than half its oil from the
Persian Gulf, appealed for an early and peaceful end to the war.
   ``Our country ... considers it extremely regrettable that
valuable lives were lost and express our heartfelt condolences to
the victims and their bereaved family members,'' government
spokesman Keizo Obuchi said.

   The head of the nation's largest teacher
union proposed today that each state name at least one school
district a ``learning laboratory'' where teachers and others could
freely experiment with reform.
   Such districts would have broad freedom to ``redefine not only
what we teach, but how we teach America's children,'' said Mary
Hatwood Futrell, president of the 1.9 million member National
Education Association which is holding its annual convention here
this week.
   Futrell proposed the learning laboratories idea, which she
called ``our most ambitious reform effort to date,'' in her keynote
address delivered t the convention's opening session.
   The more than 8,000 NEA delegates meeting at the Superdome were
to vote on the proposal later today.
   In an explanatory paper being distributed to delegates, the
union said among the reforms learning laboratory districts might
devise include more flexible school scheduling, partnerships with
area colleges, financing by means other than property tax, and
curricula managed by classroom teachers.
   But Futrell stressed that the reforms could take many different
shape, that change should not be dictated from outside the
laboratory district, but should be determined by local teachers,
school administrators, parents, businesses and others.
   Delegates of the rival American Federation of Teachers, holding
its annual meeting in San Francisco, endorsed a reform
experimentation idea of its own on Sunday. The AFT version would
pave the way for experiments in a thousand or more districts where
groups of six or more teachers would be free to operate schools
within schools.
   At a news conference prior to her speech, Futrell called the AFT
schools within schools proposal ``not a new idea'' and ``more
narrow than what we have proposed.''
   She also revealed that she had presented Democratic presidential
hopeful Michael Dukakis with a list of four preferred running
mates: the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Tennessee Sen. Al Gore, Jr., Ohio
Sen. John Glenn, and Florida Sen. Bob Graham.
   ``I believe any of the four would be very strong additions,''
she told reporters.
   AFT delegates also supported a resolution calling for curbs on
standardized testing of kindergarten children, an idea that has
caught on in Minneapolis and Georgia in recent years.
   AFT leaders were expecting a spirited debate today on the
union's stand on bilingual education.
   Both unions seemed agreed that school reform dictated from
on-high by state governments had either failed outright or had gone
as far as it could. Both argued that reform could only move forward
if schools themselves, and teachers in particular, were free to
initiate improvements.
   Despite the NEA leadership's oft-stated political
open-mindedness, Futrell's keynote address was sharply partisan.
She repeatedly blasted the Reagan administration's education and
civil rights policies and praised Democratic candidate Michael
Dukakis.
   The nation needs ``a president who will give us a fair deal
instead of an arms deal, a drug deal, or an insider deal, a
president who will invest more to make every American child a star
than he will to fill God's heaven with star wars,'' she said.
   At Futrell's urging, the NEA board of directors last week
endorsed Dukakis for the democratic nomination, making it the first
large union to do so this election year. Theoretically, Bush is
still in the running for the union's backing for the November
election after both parties meet this summer. But the odds are
minimal considering that fewer than 30 percent of NEA members
consider themselves Republican.
   ``The son of a teacher, a teacher himself, Governor Dukakis
understands and embodies the link between education and the
American dream'' Futrell said.
   The AFT has said it will not endorse any candidates until after
this summer's political conventions.

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Queen Elizabeth and
Prince Philip arrived Monday evening for a 41-hour visit marked by
some of the tightest security measures ever taken to protect
visiting dignitaries.
   The couple were welcomed at Ypenburg Air Force base near The
Hague by Dutch Queen Beatrix and her German-born husband Prince
Claus after the royal jet touched down.
   Elizabeth, wearing a gold-colored suit with dark broad-brimmed
hat, also was greeted by Princess Juliana, the former Dutch queen,
and her German-born husband, Prince Bernhard, as well as by Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek.
   Also at the windy arrival ceremony was Princess Margriet, the
Dutch queen's sister, Margriet's husband, Pieter van Vollenhoven,
and Michael Jenkins, British ambassador to the Netherlands.
   After the greeting ceremony, Queen Elizabeth reviewed an honor
guard of the Dutch Military Police drawn up on the tarmac.
   Queen Elizabeth is in the Netherlands as part of the
tricentenary observance of the ``Glorious Revolution'' which
brought Dutch-born Prince William III to the British throne three
centuries ago.
   Her heavily guarded visit takes place against the backdrop of
two Irish Republican Army terrorist attacks in the eastern
Netherlands May 1 that killed three British airmen and wounded
three others.
   The incident has heightened security measures to an
unprecedented level.
   In addition, Dutch gay rights groups have called for
demonstrations during the queen's Tuesday visit to Amsterdam to
protest the recent parlimentary passage of Section 28 of the
British Local Government Act 1988.
   Section 28 bans the promotion of homosexuality in schools as a
valid family relationship. Protest organizers, who maintain the
British law discriminates against homosexuals, have called for
Amsterdam residents to show their opposition by hanging pink flags
from their windows during the queen's visit.
   Amsterdam is the venue of the only public event scheduled for
the couple, and police have refused to issue any public
demonstration permits during the visit.
   After the Monday welcoming ceremony the royal couple was driven
in a bullet-proof limousine from the military airfield to Huis ten
Bosch palace, the Dutch royal residence on the outskirts of The
Hague.

<TEXT>
   Sweden's Stefan Edberg, relying on
precision volleys and court coverage, outdueled West Germany's
Boris Becker on Monday to win his first Wimbledon title in the
rain-plagued men's singles championship.
   Edberg, 22, defeated Becker, the 1985 and 1986 Wimbledon
champion, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4, 6-2 on the famed grass Centre Court
at the All England Club.
   Edberg's big serves, solid volleys and control of the court
evoked images of compatriot Bjorn Borg as he earned the third Grand
Slam title of his career. He also prevented a West German sweep of
the tournament; Steffi Graff won the women's crown on Saturday.
   Edberg, ranked third in the world and two-time winner of the
Australian Open, beat Czech Miloslav Mecir in a spectacular
come-from-behind victory to advance to the finals. Becker, 20, beat
No. 1-ranked Ivan Lendl.
   The showdown, rained out Sunday after only 23 minutes of play,
took two hours, 52 minutes to complete on court. From scheduled
start to final point, however, it lasted more than 27 hours.

<HEAD>Perlman Says Women See Beast As `Ultimate Fantasy Lover'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RADNOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ron Perlman, who plays the beast Vincent on
television's ``Beauty and the Beast,'' says he has been amazed to
find himself a sex symbol because of the role.
   ``More than 95 percent of the people who write to me are
women,'' he said in an interview published in the July 9 issue of
TV Guide magazine. ``Their letters are filled with sexual
fantasies.''
   The 37-year-old actor whose half-man, half-beast character's
love affair with Catherine Chandler (Linda Hamilton) is
unconsummated in the show has received up to nine letters from one
viewer.
   ``Women say that Vincent is the ultimate fantasy lover, someone
who asks nothing in return but gives 110 percent,'' Perlman said.
``He evokes deep unconscious feelings of longing for a connection
to someone who understands things on a very emotional level.''
   Perlman said at first he didn't want the role, because he had
been hidden behind makeup in previous roles, including Salvatore,
the hunchback in ``The Name of the Rose,'' and a prehistoric man in
``Quest for Fire.''
   But Vincent, whose fangs and lion-like appearance belie his
soothing voice, is ``so romantic and heroic and poetic, it's like
playing Hamlet every week,'' Perlman said. ``This may just be the
greatest role of my life.''
   Perlman, who is married to fashion designer Opal Stone and has a
4-year-old daughter, Blake Amanda, studied acting at Lehman College
in New York City and the University of Minnesota. He performed in
plays by Shakespeare, Chekhov and Pinter with the Classic Stage
Company in New York and in 1976 was picked to star in a
two-character play, ``The Architect and the Emperor of Assyria,''
directed by Tom O'Horgan.
   His artistic success did not mean he was living well.
   ``I was one of these actors who landed wonderfully artistic
projects once a year and then just sat around because nobody ever
thought of me as a commercial property,'' Perlman said. ``I never
did soaps. I never did commercials. I tried, but I never did the
things actors do while they are waiting for the good stuff; I only
did the good stuff.''
   For Perlman, ``Quest for Fire'' seemed like an opportunity to
achieve commercial success as well. But after that role, no offers
came.
   Perlman withdrew from acting and went through what he recalls as
a purging of his depression.
   ``It was like an incredible dividing line between my childhood
and my adult life,'' he said.
   Now that he is receiving attention as Vincent, Perlman said he
feels as if his career is actually beginning.
   ``If things go the way they should, I see myself ending up as
perhaps the next antihero _ like Jack Nicholson. ... That will be
the ultimate experiment _ to see if anyone is interested in my
face.''

<HEAD>Reagan Says Gorbachev Is An Original</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says that unlike other Soviet
leaders he's met, with Mikhail Gorbachev ``you don't get any
feeling of cunning.''
   ``He is himself _ no imitation of anyone that I've ever known,''
the president said in the August issue of Life magazine. ``... He's
straightforward.''
   Reagan said the one question he did not get to ask during the
Moscow summit was whether Gorbachev believes in God.
   ``I had that curiosity for a time because I was so surprised at
his use of the name God. And I couldn't figure how I could really
get into a one-on-one conversation with him, knowing where atheism
stands in their country.''
   The president said he never got the opportunity to ask, but a
Soviet interpreter said that Gorbachev's usage of God was
``commonplace. It was just a form of expression: god with a small
g.''
   Asked if one has to believe in God in order to be an ethical
person, Reagan said, ``I don't know how people who don't believe
set their rules of conduct.
   ``I'm sure there are people who are atheists who, at the same
time, abide by the general rules of conduct that we all believe
in,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fourth and `Final' Trial Date in Stalker Case Has Come and Gone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years after a spate of murderous
bedroom attacks terrorized Californians, the ``Night Stalker'' case
has cost Los Angeles County more than $1 million, and the defendant
still has not come to trial.
   Last Thursday the fourth start date for the trial of Richard
Ramirez had to be abandoned when defense attorneys, who had
promised to be ready, challenged the judge for bias.
   The prosecutor, awaiting a ruling on the last-minute defense
motion to remove the judge, says this is ``the last gasp'' of delay
he can envision.
   ``I have high hopes,'' said Deputy District Attorney P. Philip
Halpin. ``The issue is straightforward. It should be decided by the
time we come back to court on July 7.''
   He said the trial could start immediately after that. But even
if it does begin in July, both sides have estimated that jury
selection could take up to eight months.
   Two defense lawyers, who have been berated by the judge and by
Halpin for being dilatory and unprepared, aren't saying what their
next move will be. Arturo and Daniel Hernandez, who are not
related, did not return repeated calls to their San Jose offices
last week.
   Meanwhile, the legal clock is ticking. The defense, in promising
to be ready for trial June 30, did not waive Ramirez' right to a
speedy trial within 10 days of that date.
   ``We intend to start the trial by the 10th of July,'' said
Halpin.
   But Halpin acknowledged that technically, the 10-day limit dates
from the time the motion is resolved. And the defense could still
choose to waive the time limit if the trial must be delayed again.
   The county has spent $1.28 million on court and investigatory
fees, according to the county auditor-controller's office. That
does not include $15,000 a month for Ramirez' private jail cell.
   Halpin has worried aloud that witnesses who have waited three
years to testify may become reluctant to relive now distant
memories of nightmarish events if the case is postponed yet again.
   Ramirez, 28, a drifter from El Paso, Texas, is charged in Los
Angeles County with 13 counts of murder and 31 other felonies
allegedly committed during a string of night-time assaults in the
summer of 1985.
   Attacks also took place from Mission Viejo in Orange County to
the Lake Merced district of San Francisco.
   The so-called Night Stalker generally entered homes through
unlocked doors and left pentagrams, a symbol often associated with
devil worship, scrawled at some crime scenes and on some victims.
   Ramirez shouted ``Hail Satan'' and flashed a pentagram drawn on
his hand during an early court appearance.
   In their challenge to the judge, the Hernandezes said Superior
Court Judge Michael Tynan showed that he believed Ramirez was a
satanist when he asked if the defendant wished to swear to God or
would rather affirm before testifying at pretrial proceedings.
   The lawyers also say Tynan called them a security risk during a
chambers conference.
   ``Although the defense would have wished that the judge had been
able to overcome his bias and tendencies toward prejudice, it has
become increasingly obvious that Judge Tynan cannot do this,'' the
defense team said in an affidavit.
   When the Hernandezes were hired in late 1985, Municipal Court
Judge Elva Soper advised Ramirez that his counsel did not meet the
court's standards for appointment because they had never tried a
death penalty case before.
   Arturo Hernandez had practiced for two years and Daniel
Hernandez for three years. Their opponent, Halpin, has been a
prosecutor for 23 years and handled many capital cases.
   At one point, Tynan assigned a lawyer to assist the two novice
defense attorneys in completing their pretrial motions. But trial
dates of Sept. 30, Feb. 1 and March 22 had to be postponed. One
delay was due to an appellate court ruling giving the defense
access to massive police records which had to be compiled for them.
   ``We've been delayed too long,'' Halpin said after a brief
hearing Thursday. ``This is about the last gasp. We're ready to
go.''

<HEAD>Ruling Party's Credibility To Be Challenged In Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party,
which has dominated Mexican politics for almost 60 years, faces a
tough test Wednesday in which its credibility is at stake.
   Few doubt that the the PRI will win in the July 6 presidential
elections.
   The question is whether this party, which has monopolized past
contests, will emerge with a landslide victory or clinch barely
enough votes to continue its mandate.
   The PRI has defied political logic by never losing a
presidential election or gubernatorial race in any of Mexico's 31
states since it was founded in 1929. But it also has been accused
of stuffing ballot boxes to give itself almost incredible
victories, with anywhere from 74 to 95 percent of the vote.
   This time, party officials privately admit that they would be
satisfied with 50 percent of the vote.
   The PRI is under pressure both from its members and the
opposition to change the system that has kept many poor Mexicans
politically passive, although it has pushed the economy to grow.
   But many Mexicans were angered by the economic crises of the
1970s and early 1980s, which they believe were brought on by the
party's inept administration, reckless borrowing and brazen
corruption.
   As a result, President Miguel De la Madrid has spent his six
years in office trying to control inflation and a foreign debt now
exceeding $100 billion, and to push up the Mexican peso, whose
value dropped from 23 to the dollar in 1980 to 2,300 to the dollar
this week.
   De la Madrid has managed to pull inflation down to 36 percent
for the first five months of this year, compared to a record 159
percent in 1987.
   Neverthless, his party is virtually under political siege.
   ``The erosion, discredit and lack of credibility of the
political system is such that even if it wins the elections, its
capacity to govern will depend on how it wins,'' wrote political
analyst Jorge Castaneda.
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a certain winner as the presidential
candidate of the PRI, is a Harvard-educated economist who sounds
like a reformist pointing out the vices of the system. Once
elected, de Gortari's term will last until 1994.
   
   In his campaign, de Gortari speaks of the need to democratize a
system his party has run since 1929 and to admit what he calls
``our defeats'' at the polls.
   ``We are going to lead the democratic reform that the nation
demands,'' he said recently in a speech.
   The balding, mustachioed de Gortari, presents himself as part of
a more dynamic generation of PRI leaders.
   But Manuel J. Clouthier, the second major presidential candidate
and a member of the rightist National Action Party, blames the PRI
for Mexico's economic problems and hammers away at corruption in
the administration.
   Clouthier, a bearded businessman from the northwestern coastal
state of Sinalosa, is demanding changes in the name of the middle
class.
   ``The group in power since 1929 has failed and has lost its
opportunity,'' Clouthier says. ``They can't present themselves as
the saviors of today. They are the same people who have brought us
to the situation in which we find ourselves.''
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a dissident who broke with the PRI last
year, is the third major presidential candidate and represents the
National Democratic Front, an alliance of disaffected leftist
groups. A former governor of the central state of Michoacan,
Cardenas unsuccessfully tried to reform the PRI before abandoning
it.

   Merv Griffin, whose career has included stints
as a singer, talk show host, game show producer and more recently
real estate mogul, says buying and selling property is a lot like a
game.
   Griffin, who began his career in 1949 as a singer in the Freddy
Martin band, entered the real estate business after Coca-Cola
bought his Merv Griffin Productions for an estimated $250 million.
   ``I had an important life decision to make,'' Griffin said in
the August issue of Life magazine. ``I could have sat around and
collected the monies from various investments, spent the rest of my
life clipping coupons. But I thought, `No, no no. There's got to be
another career.'''
   ``To me,'' said the 63-year-old Griffin, ``retirement is the
choice after death.''
   ``What I am doing now is fun,'' said Griffin, who recently won
control of Donald Trump's Resorts International in a hostile
takeover and bought the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
   ``I love the gamesmanship,'' said Griffin. ``This may sound
strange, but it parallels the game shows I've been involved in.''
Griffin helped create television's popular ``Wheel of Fortune'' and
``Jeopardy!''
   His real-life conquests apparently have inspired him. Griffin
says he is working on a new show based on the game Monopoly.

   A judge will hold a hearing Tuesday to set
conditions for releasing two Tuscarora Indians who have been held
without bond for five months since a newspaper office takeover,
defense attorney William Kunstler said Monday.
   ``We tried to get them out today (Monday),'' Kunstler said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``We thought Independence Day
would be a great day for them to come out.''
   But the hearing could not be scheduled until Tuesday at the
federal courthouse in New Bern because of the holiday, Kunstler
said.
   Eddie Hatcher, 30, and Timothy Jacobs, 19, are set to go to
trial July 11 on federal charges of hostage-taking and
manufacturing illegal firearms. The two are charged with holding up
to 20 people hostage Feb. 1 at The Robesonian newspaper office in
Lumberton in Robeson County, near the South Carolina line.
   They are being held at the Craven County Jail in New Bern, 120
miles east of Lumberton.
   Conditions of release were discussed Monday during a conference
call that involved Kunstler and Bob Warren, a defense attorney from
the Christic Institute South in Carrboro, N.C.; the U.S. Attorney's
Office in North Carolina; and U.S. District Court Judge Terence
Boyle, Kunstler said.
   ``They will be released,'' he said. ``The circuit court has
ordered it.''
   The terms of release discussed in the conference call include
that the two stay out of Robeson County; that they live with
friends or relatives; and that they not violate any aspect of the
law even though they may consider it symbolic free speech, Kunstler
said.
   ``These are the conditions we proposed to the judge months
ago,'' he said. ``They are our conditions.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Stuart Bruce would not comment on
the conference call, which Kunstler said came after the 4th U.S.
Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that a federal magistrate failed to
hold a detention hearing within the required five days.
   Kunstler said he received a copy of the opinion Saturday. The
appeals court in Richmond, Va., was closed for the holiday weekend
and the ruling could not be independently confirmed.
   ``The Court of Appeals minced no words in its opinion,'' he said
Monday, adding that the court called the detention ``a flat
violation'' of the time requirements.
   The two men had gone before Magistrate Wallace Dixon on Feb. 2
but didn't have their detention hearing until Feb. 17. At that
time, Dixon ordered them held without bond. Boyle upheld the
decision at a hearing in April.
   Kunstler said Dixon contends the two Indians waived their
detention hearing, saying they were afraid to be released. But
Kunstler said defendants cannot legally waive their own hearing.
   Although the trial is scheduled to begin July 11, Kunstler said
there probably will be a continuance. He also said he would try to
have the trial held in the Fayetteville division court, which
includes Robeson County.

   ``Hopefully, this move will see an end to the cacophony of

   Americans love peanut butter. Americans love
joining clubs. So, what could be more natural than a gathering of
adults who love the sticky stuff?
   That's what planned next month at Opryland USA in Nashville,
Tenn., when some of the 20,000 members of a peanut butter club will
sample various kinds of peanut butter, visit a peanut butter
history center and enjoy an appearance by a celebrity fellow peanut
butter lover.
   ``There's going to be more peanut butter and peanut butter
lovers in one place than any time in the past,'' said Harris
Blackwood, a spokesman for the Georgia Peanut Commission, a major
sponsor of the meeting Aug. 11-14.
   The club was organized in 1986 by the New York-based Peanut
Advisory Board, which represents growers in Georgia, Alabama and
Florida, to unite adults who are still stuck on peanut butter.

   When three teen-agers were negotiating to
buy 13{ miles of abandoned rail lines, they had to send an adult
member of their board to represent them.
   ``All the adults said this cannot be done,'' said co-owner
Jeffrey Dobek. ``We, as naive teen-agers, said, `Why can't it be
done?' and kept working.''
   Today, Dobek, Dale Pape and John Shaw say their Southern
Michigan Railroad Society Inc. is chugging along swell. The trio,
all 23 and college students, lined up support in August 1982 from
state and local politicians and both of Michigan's U.S. senators to
buy the lines from Conrail.
   In 1984, they struck a deal for $100,000 to buy the lines.
Volunteers helped them restore the track and rail cars.
   The society operates tourist trains on weekends that travel a
4{-mile route between Clinton and Tecumseh. In the autumn, the
railroad offers a 9-mile leaf-peeking tour.
   Dobek said at first Conrail didn't know it was negotiating with
teen-agers.
   ``We didn't tell them,'' he said. ``We did everything by mail.
When we had a meeting, we sent one of our adult board members.''
   When Conrail officials learned the potential buyers were high
school students, they were skeptical that the teen-agers could
raise the money to buy the abandoned track, Dobek said.
   But the youths, who studied tourist trains in other parts of the
country, convinced Conrail the debt could be paid off through
society membership donations and ticket revenues. So far, that's
exactly what has happened.

<HEAD>Little Time For Reflection By Commanders In Persian Gulf</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. commanders in the Persian Gulf are
operating under hair-trigger rules of engagement designed to
prevent unexpected attacks on American warships, such the one on
the USS Stark last year that killed 37 servicemen.
   ``The number one obligation of the commanding officer of a ship
or units is the protection of his own people,'' said the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe, defending the
Navy against charges that the USS Vincennes overreacted Sunday when
it shot down an Iranian jetliner carring 290 people.
   The imperative for self-defense _ combined with the cramped
quarters in the Gulf, the introduction there of advanced weapons
that allow adversaries to kill quickly from a great distance, and
the large number of on-again off-again combatants _ have produced
an explosive situation.
   Pentagon officials refuse to spell out publicly the rules of
engagement, the standing orders under which commanders are
authorized to open fire. Whatever they are, the commander of the
Vincennes apparently is convinced he followed them.
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition they not be further
identified, said Monday that the commander, Capt. Will C. Rogers
III, had sent a message to his superiors stressing that he had
followed procedures and would make the same decisions if faced
again with the situation.
   The sources were unable to provide quotes from the
communication, which they described as secret.
   Despite official silence, events and statements over the past 14
months have given a fairly detailed picture of when American forces
will shoot.
   ``We can go on what is known as hostile intent. That is to say
if a fellow has a weapons system aimed at us and we have a pretty
high assurance that he going to shoot at us, we can take it out,''
the commander of U.S. forces in the region, Marine Corps Gen.
George B. Crist told reporters last Thursday.
   Crowe said U.S. commanders ``do not have to be shot at before
responding,'' a condition that was made known in the form of a
Notice to Airmen, or NOTAM, to all nations and parties involved in
the Gulf, including commercial air air carriers operating there.
   Rogers said in an interview before sailing his ship to the
Persian Gulf that ``there is a very clear-cut set of engagement
rules which we go by and we're certainly not there to initiate
hostilities.''
   Since the U.S. Navy increased its presence in the Persian Gulf
in the spring of 1987, and began to escort reflagged Kuwaiti
tankers last summer, Crowe said, ``We are, of course, constantly
surveying and reviewing not only the circumstances under which we
operate, but also the rules of engagement.''
   ``We do not discuss the rules in detail,'' he told reporters
Sunday after the airliner was shot down, ``but this obviously will
put increased emphasis on such a review.''
   Until Sunday, the greatest loss of life in a single incident
involving the U.S. Navy in the Gulf came from what was later
described as a mistaken attack by an Iraqi fighter which fired two
Exocet missiles into the unsuspecting cruiser USS Stark on May 17,
1987.
   The explosions and fire killed 37 American seaman and ended the
careers of the Stark's commander, Capt. Glenn R. Brindel, and other
senior officers, who were severely criticized and forced to retire.
   On Sunday, one of those chastised officers defended Rogers,
saying the Vincennes had no choice but to fend off what appeared to
be a attacking warplane.
   ``If the plane was unfortunate enough to be flying toward the
Vincennes while the Vincennes was engaging Iranian patrol boats ...
I'm not surprised this kind of thing would happen,'' said Basil E.
Moncrief.
   According to the Pentagon account, Rogers followed what appeared
to be carefully laid out procedures. The sophisticated Aegis radar
and tracking system aboard the Vincennes, one of the most advanced
ships in the Navy, detected an aircraft approaching from Iranian
airspace at 10:47 a.m. local time (2:47 EDT), officials said.
   At the time, the Vincennes was exchanging fire with three
Iranian Boghammer gunboats, 43-foot-long vessels that Iran has used
to attack tankers, they said.
   ``One of the most difficult problems is from a radar blip,
particularly from a head-on target, to identify the type of
aircraft,'' said Crowe.
   If the Vincennes had a side view of the plane, or had more time,
it might not have mistaken the airbus, which is 177 feet long, for
an F-14, which is 62 feet long, Pentagon officials said.
   The Vincennes broadcast three warnings on a civilian emergency
network, which airliners normally monitor, and four warnings on a
frequency normally monitored by warplanes, Crowe said.
Additionally, he said the ship intercepted and analyzed
``electronic indications'' which the admiral declined to discuss in
detail.
   The approaching aircraft appeared to descend and accelerate, as
would a warplane preparing to launch an anti-ship missile, and was
declared ``hostile'' four minutes after it was spotted by radar, he
said. Three minutes later, when the plane was about nine miles from
the Vincennes, the American warship fired. The first visual
sighting of the plane came with the impact of at least one of the
missiles, when the aircraft was about six miles from the Vincennes,
said Crowe.
   Crist indicated to reporters last week that the rules of
engagement varied depending on the threat, and that the biggest
threats were perceived to be anti-ship missiles, such as the
Chinese-made Silkworm.
   Use of a weapon like the Silkworm, he suggested, would call for
destruction not only of the missile, but the battery that fired it.
   ``If they fire a Silkworm at me we can go get them,'' he said.
   But in recent months the Iranians have avoided attacking U.S.
forces, making it doubly hard for American commanders to guess
whether they may be about to face hostile fire.
   ``They have been most circumspect,'' said Crist. ``They've been
very careful not to antagonize us. We had an (Iranian) F-4 come out
the other day ... and our ships challenged him, (and) he said, `I'm
on my way to engage an Iraqi.'''

<HEAD>Bush Expresses Deep Regrets Over Downing of Iranian Jetliner</HEAD>

   Vice President George Bush on Monday
voiced regret over the accidental destruction of an Iranian
jetliner by a U.S. warship, but said the tragic incident would not
alter U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf.
   ``My respects to families and loved ones of those who lost
lives, but life goes on, our mission goes on and the world keeps
turning,'' Bush said as he campaigned through the Midwest.
   The all-but-certain Republican nominee echoed the views of
President Reagan who said U.S. warships will remain in the gulf in
the wake of Sunday's U.S. missile attack on an Iran Air Airbus with
290 people aboard.
   ``We want peace in the gulf, but we also want the right of
navigation in international waters,'' Reagan told reporters upon
his return to the White House from a weekend at Camp David.
   The vice president, who broke his silence on the incident, said
he ``would just reject the comparison'' to the Soviet Union's
destruction of a Korean airliner that strayed into Soviet airspace
in 1983.
   ``This plane was warned. This was flying in a combat zone,''
Bush said. He claimed the two episodes were ``totally separate,
totally different.''
   Bush also said he would not suspend his presidential campaigning
because of the gulf tragedy, telling reporters, ``there is nothing
I can be doing about this matter in Washington, D.C.''
   However, the vice president planned to return to Washington late
Monday after participating in Independence Day festivities in
Wyandotte, a Detroit suburb, and in two other Midwestern cities.
Aides said Bush had been in telephone contact with military
advisers and would attend a White House briefing on Tuesday.
   Bush learned of the attack Sunday morning while attending church
services in Kennebunkport, Maine, the seacoast town where he has a
vacation home. He later participated in a conference call with
Reagan and senior White House officials, said Craig Fuller, Bush's
chief of staff.
   Bush told reporters at Detroit International Airport he was
saddened by Sunday's events.
   ``Obviously, as we celebrate our great national holiday our
hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were lost
and also (hearts) go out to those kids, those young Americans who
are defending freedom half way around the world,'' he said.
   En route to a Fourth of July parade in this Detroit suburb, Bush
adhered closely to the Reagan administration's support for the
captain of the USS Vincennes and said he thinks most Americans
share his feelings.
   ``It appears the captain of that ship followed the rules and did
what he had to do, protect American life,'' Bush said.
   Questioned as to why the warship's sophisticated radar equipment
could not distinguish between the wide-bodied airliner and the
smaller F-14 fighter, Bush, a World War II pilot, responded
testily, ``Ever been in combat. Combat is quite different than the
laboratory.''
   And asked about Iranian threats of retaliation, Bush said,
``From time to time, Iran makes such threats, but our people are
alert. We can't be deterred by threats.''
   The Republican candidate said he didn't think the episode would
figure in the presidential race, saying, ``Americans are together
on this.''
   He also said there was no reason to halt campaign activity
because of the tragedy. ``This is a national holiday. It is
appropriate that we celebrate it,'' he said.
   The vice president said he did not think the downing of the
commercial airliner is ``more significant than other incidents, but
it is significant.'' Bush cited the loss of U.S. servicemen aboard
the USS Stark, which was hit by an Iraqi missile on May 17, 1987,
as a significant incident in the gulf.
   Bush was also scheduled to participate in an Independence Day
celebration in Elmwood, Ill., a Chicago suburb, and attend a rally
for new U.S. citizens and watch an airshow in St. Louis.

<HEAD>Khomeini's Daughter Gives Rare Insight Into His Home Life</HEAD>

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini reads the
Koran, Islam's holy book, seven times a day, takes the radio with
him to the bathroom to keep up with the news, and is an obsessive
clock watcher, his daughter, Zahra, says.
   In a talk earlier this month to students at Roshd High School in
Tehran, she gave an insight into the home life of Iran's
revolutionary patriarch.
   ``His self-discipline is unbelievable. You wouldn't believe it
unless you saw it for yourself,'' she told the children.
   The talk was published in the Islamic Revolution Martyr
Foundation's magazine and reprinted in an unofficial
English-language newsletter received recently in Nicosia.
   Khomeini's daughter, whose married name is Mostafavi, made no
mention of the 82-year-old leader's health, reported to be
deteriorating.
   Mrs. Mostafavi, 49, painted a portrait of a loving, if
demanding, father who used to take his family on summer vacations
in the mountains before he became a revolutionary leader banished
into exile by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   That's a far cry from his public image of the stern, unsmiling
zealot whose fundamentalist Moslem revolution eliminated former
allies and brought Iran into a seemingly endless war with Iraq.
   Mrs. Mostafavi was quoted as saying her father observes a strict
schedule at his home in the north Tehran suburb of Jamaran and
becomes so engrossed in his studies of the Koran or affairs of
state that he sometimes doesn't talk for hours.
   ``He's so punctual that if he doesn't turn up for lunch at
exactly 1:20 p.m., everyone gets worried,'' she said. ``He
regulates his day in such a way that he turns up for lunch at
exactly that time.''
   She said: ``To him, such things as `I sleep whenever I like' or
`I feel like going to sleep' are meaningless. He eats exactly on
time. He wakes up exactly on time. He goes to bed exactly on time.''
   Mrs. Mostafavi noted: ``He goes walking three times a day, each
time for exactly 20 minutes. When he gets back, he looks at his
watch to see if it's been 20 minutes.''
   ``If it's not, he turns around and takes a few more steps just
to make everything complete.''
   She said that Khomeini, engrossed in some activity or other,
sometimes won't even talk to her when she goes to his study.
   ``Just because I'm his daughter doesn't mean that we have a
conversation each time,'' she said. ``I go into the room and say
hello and just sit there because he's either listening to the radio
or watching television or reading letters and reports.
   ``He's not free even for a minute. Even in the bathroom, he has
the radio with him.''
   She said Khomeini's income includes ``ta'aroufi,'' or personal
gifts from well-wishers and admirers to show their respect for his
religious standing.
   She said these gifts include ``some money or gold'' which he
sometimes spends ``on home expenses.''
   Mrs. Mostafavi said her father's income ``is a lot. He usually
received a lot of gold ... but he spends moderately ... He leads a
simple life.''
   Referring to Khomeini's religious devotion, she said: ``He reads
the Koran seven times a day at special times. There are also prayer
books he reads and he doesn't care who's there.''
   Diplomats who have visited Khomeini at home said he regularly
listens to the British Broadcasting Corporation's Persian Service,
a habit that dates back to his exile in Iraq from 1963 to 1978.
   Khomeini was expelled from Iraq in 1978 and went to France. He
lived in Paris for four months before returning to Iran in 1979,
when his Islamic revolution toppled the shah.
   The visitors said Khomeini often wears a small transistor radio
on a cord around his neck. He also is reported to be a fan of
Mickey Mouse and often watches cartoons on a videocassete recorder.
   Mrs. Mostafavi is one of Khomeini's three daughters. His son,
Ahmed, 48, is one of his closest advisers and carefully screens the
hundreds of people who want to visit him every day.
   Diplomats who have been based in Tehran said Ahmed only allows
two or three people to see his father every day, usually at
breakfast or lunch, so as not to tire him.
   Another son, Mustafa, died in Iraq during Khomeini's exile there.
   Khomeini married Khanom Batool Saqafi in the Iranian holy city
of Qom when he was a 29-year-old theology student and she was a
teen-ager. Mrs. Mostafavi said her mother, who is rarely seen in
public, is ``very sedate and cool. She went with him everwhere. In
all that time, she has never complained or grouched.''
   Despite his unyielding religious and political beliefs, Mrs.
Mostafavi said Khomeini ``is very easy with his children. He has 14
grandchildren and a great-grandchild now. He allows the children a
large degree of freedom.
   ``He doesn't preach to the grownups that they should do this or
that. He sets examples by his actions ... but he gets very angry at
the slightest act forbidden by religion.
   ``He tells us not to waste things. Once I cooked him something
and burned it. I put it in front of him, but he didn't eat it.
   ``He said it was bad. I asked jokingly, `but you shouldn't be
ungrateful for the blessing of God?'
   ``He anwered back: `Is it me who is ungrateful or is it you who
have done such a thing to God's blessing?'
   ``He's somewhat formal with people other than his family. But
he's very kind to his family.''
   Khomeini returned to Tehran Feb. 1, 1979, from exile in Paris to
a tumultuous welcome after more than 14 years in exile.
   Ten days later, when the revolutionaries took over the symbols
of government, the shah's palace, state buildings and army
barracks, Mrs. Mostafavi said she was with Khomeini listening to
the radio.
   ``Suddenly he jumped up and said, `It's over! It's over!' she
said.
   ``The radio and television station had been seized. I realized
that meant the fall of the regime. I've never seen such joy on his
face as I did then,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Arab students
pelted soldiers with rocks and blocked a main road Monday in
Bethlehem, and the army slapped a three-day closure order on all
West Bank schools.
   Troops in this biblical town fired tear gas and dozens of
students were overcome by the gas, hospital officials said.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, meanwhile, announced the nearly
7-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied territories had cost the
Defense Ministry $162 million and Israel's economy was in danger if
the rebellion continued, Israel radio said.
   The radio reported scattered incidents of stone throwing in the
West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem, where Arab protesters briefly
erected a roadblock on the main commercial thoroughfare.
   Police arrested five Palestinian schoolgirls for allegedly
stoning Israeli cars near the east Jerusalem neighborhood of
Silwan, the radio said.
   Releasing new figures on incidents of unrest inside Israel,
Police Commissioner David Krauss said Arab nationalists were
responsible for 114 out of 210 forest and pasture arsons.
   Krauss said more than 1,000 protests broke out inside Israel in
the last three months, including 730 demonstrations in the
Jerusalem area and 51 firebomb attacks.
   He said 900 Arabs had been arrested on a variety of charges,
including 55 suspected of arson.
   In Bethlehem, five miles south of Jerusalem, hundreds of
students demonstrated on the main road, hurling stones at troops
who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
   In an effort to limit student participation in the uprising, the
army announced it would close all Palestinian schools in the West
Bank for three days starting Tuesday.
   The move was timed to coincide with a PLO call to rename all
Arab schools with more nationalistic names on that day, said Brig.
Gen. Shaike Erez, head of Israel's military administration in the
West Bank.
   The order was the first West Bank-wide shutdown of Arab schools
since the area's 800 schools were reopened on June 6 after a
four-month closure.
   At the height of the uprising in February, the army closed 1,200
schools attended by 475,000 students in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Erez said he hoped closing schools again would ``bring home to
students and parents that the current level of disturbances is
unacceptable.''
   But Bethlehem high school senior Adnan Mohammed blamed the army
presence in the territories for the student protests and said they
would continue as long as Israeli occupation continued.
   ``There is no atmosphere to study, with soldiers at the entrance
to schools,'' Mohammed said, adding that only 19 of the 30 students
in his class showed up for studies.
   ``Where are the others? One was shot and killed during the
uprising, four are in jail and the other six are under curfew in
the Deheishe refugee camp. Nobody is in the mood to study,''
Mohammed said.
   History teacher Hisham Mughrabi said students were commited to
calls by underground leaders to hold protests and would not heed
admonishments from school adminstrators not to demonstrate.
   ``It used to be the teacher got respect, but that's all changed.
If we tell them not to demonstrate, they say it's the leadership's
order. We can't argue with them,'' Mughrabi said.
   An Associated Press reporter saw one Bethlehem school that was
renamed ``Intefadeh,'' or Arabic for ``Uprising,'' apparently in
compliance with the call to give schools more nationalistic names.

   Fighting between rival Palestinian
guerrilla groups Monday killed 24 people as artillery shells
pulverized the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp, according to police.
   They said 67 others were wounded in the battle between Col.
Saeed Mousa's Syrian-backed Fatah-Uprising and Fatah guerrillas
loyal to Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   That raised the known casualty toll since fighting broke out May
1 to at least 151 killed and 594 wounded.
   Bodies littered the terrain along the camp's edges as the two
warring factions launched a series of attacks and counterattacks,
witnesses said.
   ``The shelling is the worst we've had in years,'' said a woman
who took advantage of an afternoon lull in the bombardment to flee
Bourj el-Barajneh.
   Sultan Abul-Ainen, Fatah's commander in Bourj el-Barajneh, said
25 people, most of them women and children, were wounded when a
160mm mortar slammed into entrance of a bomb shelter.
   Police said they were among the 67 wounded in today's fighting.
   The fighting shattered a weeklong lull in the inter-Palestinian
war for control of the Beirut camps.
   Mousa's fighters overran the nearby Chatilla camp June 27 and
had vowed to move into Bourj el-Barajneh in an attempt to crush
Arafat's forces in the Lebanese capital.
   At times, shells and rockets rained at a rate of 20 a minute on
the sprawling Shantytown on Beirut's southern outskirts, police
said.
   They said the fighting forced the closing of the Beirut airport
highway, which abuts Bourj el-Barajneh. Flight schedules were not
affected and travelers got to the airport through sidestreets.
   Columns of black smoke billowed from the camp. Mousa's gunners,
deployed in Syrian-controlled hills overlooking Beirut, hammered
the camp with 120mm and 160mm mortars, rockets and 106mm recoilless
guns, police reported.
   They said Fatah guerrillas responded with 62mm mortars and
rocket-propelled grenades.
   Abul-Ainen, Fatah's commander, said his men repulsed 13 attempts
by the dissident fighters to push into the camp in a fierce
eight-hour confrontation.
   Abul-Ainen, reached by telephone in Bourj el-Barajneh, said at
least five corpses of the attackers ``lay on the battlefield. The
dissidents could not evacuate them due to the intensity of the
fighting.''
   The fall of Chatilla was a serious setback for Arafat, who has
called on Arab leaders to help end the fighting. Abul-Ainen said
his fighters are determined to defend Bourj el-Barajneh ``to the
last man.''
   ``We warn these collaborators that Bourj el-Barajneh will not
face the same fate as Chatilla,'' he said.
   Fatah, the largest group of Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization, dislodged Mousa's followers from Bourj el-Barajneh
and the nearby Chatilla refugee camp in fighting over the past two
months.
   The dissidents regrouped along the edges of the camps and
overran Chatilla after a 13-hour battle that demolished the
shantytown and displaced hundreds of refugees.
   Libyan mediators supervised the evacuation of about 150 Arafat
loyalists from Chatilla to Fatah bases the port city of Sidon, 25
miles south of Beirut.
   Fatah and other PLO officials said 80 percent of Bourj
el-Barajneh has been knocked down in bombardments in the past 60
days. Only 3,000 of 20,000 residents remain in the camp.
   Scores of civilians fled the camp during the weeklong lull in
fighting after Chatilla fell.
   The camps have been largely devastated by fighting that began
when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, besieged West Beirut and
hammered the shantytowns with air raids and shellfire for months.
   Syrian-backed Lebanese Shiite Moslems besieged the Beirut camps
in 1985, pounding them for more than two years in a failed attempt
to prevent Arafat from rebuilding the power base he lost when
Israel drove the PLO out of Beirut in 1982.
   Mousa, who has vowed to chase the PLO out of Lebanon again,
broke away from the organization in 1983. The Syrian government
backed the mutiny by radicals opposed to Arafat, and Mousa set up
his headquarters in the Syrian capital of Damascus.
   The Beirut fighting has flared despite a reconciliation between
Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus in April to end
their 5-year-old feud. But since the fighting erupted Arafat has
accused the Syrian government of fomenting the battle in order to
assert its control over all of Beirut.

   A mild earthquake roused residents
early Monday, but there were no reports of damage or injury.
   The temblor struck at 3:57 a.m. and measured 3.7 on the Richter
scale of ground motion, said Russell Needham of the National
Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo. It was followed nearly two hours
later by a mild aftershock.
   The epicenter was 10 miles southwest of the city, which lies 30
miles southeast of Las Vegas, Needham said.
   Boulder City police reported numerous calls from residents from
as far away as Green Valley and Henderson, 20 miles to the north,
said dispatcher Nancy Shapiro.
   ``It woke me up out of a sound sleep and definitely startled
me,'' she said.
   An earthquake of 3.5 to 4 on the Richter scale could break
dishes in the immediate vicinity of the epicenter.

   The Soviet Union on Monday offered an amnesty to
soldiers who turned against their country during the Red Army's
8{-year intervention in Afghanistan, the country's chief legal
officer said.
   ``Those who could not resist hostile propaganda, who failed to
withstand suffering and privations of captivity and committed
offenses damaging our state, all of them will be amnestied out of
supreme considerations of socialist humanism,'' Prosecutor General
Alexander Sukharev told a news briefing.
   Asked if the conditions included deserters, Sukharev said they
would be included with those who suffered because of the ``extreme
conditions'' of the war in Afghanistan, to whom the amnesty will be
applied.
   It was not immediately clear if the amnesty was unconditional,
or whether there would be a review procedure.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced
one pro-Soviet government with another, and remained there to help
fight anti-Marxist insurgents. The Soviet military said in late May
that more than 13,000 soldiers had been killed in Afghanistan and
more than 35,000 wounded.
   Sukharev said the Soviet Union had identified 312 soldiers who
had been taken prisoner during the war, and had established that
about a third of them had died, many of them in the act of trying
to escape.
   ``Some of them were shot on the spot, some of them were tortured
to death,'' he said.
   Those who remain captive ``are subject to torture. They are
manacled, they are under psychological pressure, including scant
food supplies,'' he said.
   Most of the 200 are on Pakistani territory in the hands of
Afghan guerrilla groups, but an undetermined number are in the
United States, Canada and Western Europe, the prosecutor general
said.
   He said he did not know how many soldiers could be classified as
deserters.
   Sukharev said in offering the amnesty, the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet, the country's highest executive body, wanted to
refute what he said were rumors in the West that prisoners of war
and deserters would face severe punishment if they returned to the
Soviet Union.
   The Presidium already has pardoned one soldier who was punished
for desertion, he said.
   Prisoners of war who return ``will enjoy in full measure all
political, social and all other rights guaranteed by the
Constitution of the U.S.S.R. to Soviet citizens,'' he said.
   The legal official said his country was ``using all channels to
obtain the release of our soldiers and bring them back home.''
   He appealed to the United States, Pakistan and other countries
to help Soviet soldiers who are on their territory to return home.
   The Soviet Union began pulling its 100,000 soldiers out of
Afghanistan on May 15, and units still there awaiting withdrawal
are not taking part in offensive operations.
   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, commander of the Soviet force in
Afghanistan, told reporters in Moscow last week that 20,000
soldiers already had left the country.
   According to an agreement signed in Geneva on April 14, the
Soviet force is to be withdrawn completely by Feb. 15, 1989.
   However, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan repeatedly have
accused Pakistan of continuing to aid anti-Marxist guerrillas, and
the Soviets say they reserve the right to alter the withdrawal
schedule because of it.
   The Soviet Union has appealed to Pakistan several times in
recent weeks to help return Soviet prisoners of war held by the
guerrillas.
   Return of missing Soviet soldiers has become an issue of serious
concern, discussed in the official media and by top Soviet leaders
in public forums since the withdrawal began.

<HEAD>Overseas Speakers Focusing On American Election Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stung by 1984 charges that it blacklisted
liberals, the U.S. Information Agency this year is sending both
Republicans and Democrats around the world to speak about the U.S.
political system and the presidential election campaign.
   The effort, part of a $1.7 million overseas speakers program run
by USIA, involves about 120 speakers including political
professionals from both parties, election officials, university
political scientists, lawyers and writers.
   Four years ago, the American Participants Program _ known as
AmParts _ came under fire, accused of rejecting 38 proposed
speakers on partisan or ideological grounds. But Capitol Hill
overseers say the program's problems appear to have been dealt with
adequately.
   ``We don't have any complaints that are pending now,'' said Rep.
Dan Mica, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on international operations. ``I think it's a
tremendous program, but it was abused for a while. We've
straightened that out.''
   Joseph O'Connell, an official at USIA's public liaison office,
said the agency tries to take a politically balanced approach to
selecting speakers for the program.
   He said that ``for obvious reasons we don't want to make it look
like we're leaning toward (Vice President George) Bush,'' who is
all but certain to be the Republican nominee running against
Democrat Michael Dukakis in the fall presidential race.
   In some cases, USIA's approach this election year has led to
sending of Democrat-Republican teams to appear side-by-side before
foreign audiences.
   For example, political consultant Ed Rollins, manager of
President Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, this month traveled
to West Germany with Les Francis, another consultant who served as
deputy chief of staff in the Carter White House.
   Francis said that during the week-long trip they spoke to
political professionals, academics, students, journalists and
business people in four cities _ Bonn, Hamburg, Nuremberg and
Mannheim.
   He found German audiences already well versed in the basics of
American politics but eager to learn more about the nuances of this
year's campaign.
   ``They can read about what Dukakis might think about the MX or
the Midgetman (mobile missile), or they can read about what George
Bush's resume is in terms of foreign policy experience.
   ``But to get a feel for how these guys conduct their campaigns,
the kind of people around them _ that's ultimately as important to
the presidency as position papers or biographical sketches. And I
think that's what they were interested in as much as anything,''
Francis said.
   Another speaking team involved Thomas Susman, a Washington
attorney active in Democratic politics, and Loren Smith, a
conservative Republican who served as counsel to Reagan's 1980
campaign and is now chief judge of the U.S. Claims Courts. They
spent three weeks in March visiting the Philippines, Pakistan,
Turkey and Egypt.
   Susman noted that ``we went to countries where the party which
is out of power doesn't want to just win the next election, they
want to kill the people in power. They want a new constitution.
They want new forms of government.
   ``And so the example of people from the United States who have
opposing perspectives but who talk rationally about issues and
personalities with each other was something that we were told was
quite impressive,'' he said.
   Other speakers include:
   _Benjamin Ginsburg, director of Cornell University's Institute
for Public Affairs, who traveled to West Germany, Norway, Spain and
Portugal.
   ``You always understand your own politics better from afar,''
Ginsburg said. ``Americans are very ethnocentric. We see the
universe revolving around the United States. And it's very useful
to step outside the United States and see the U.S. through somebody
else's eyes. It freshens your own perspective.''
   _Jerry Hagstrom, author of a recently published book, ``Beyond
Reagan: The New Landscape of American Politics,'' and a
contributing editor of The National Journal, a Washington-based
weekly. He visited Finland, Switzerland and China.
   Hagstrom said his Chinese audiences included ``young scholars
who had just returned from spending five years in the United
States. ... But within the same audience you would have young
graduate students who have never left China. With them you had to
explain what is a caucus and what is a primary.''
   _James Lengle, a professor of government at Georgetown
University, who lectured, gave press interviews and made other
appearances in Australia and Fiji. On Fiji, he said, ``Everyone was
very much confused about how the parties go about picking their
nominees and how actually the president is elected.''
   _Samuel Shipley, chairman of the Delaware Democratic Committee,
who traveled to Denmark, Italy and Iceland. Shipley said he was
impressed at how much less it costs candidates to run for office in
those countries by comparison with the United States, where money
has become ``the cancer of politics.''
   In May 1984, USIA Director Charles Z. Wick appeared before
Mica's international operations subcommittee as it investigated the
blacklisting charges.
   Richard W. McBride, the subcommittee's staff director, said the
panel was satisfied that ``there are now nothing in the way of
political litmus tests being given to the AmParts (participants).''
   ``They really learned a lesson,'' McBride said. ``I think it was
one of the real object lessons to Wick that he could not run that
agency without paying due attention to Congress.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Investigators Abused Authority by Publishing
Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators abused their authority by publishing
allegations that some delegates to last week's Communist Party
conference had taken bribes, the Soviet Union's chief law
enforcement officer said Monday.
   But Procurator General Alexander Sukharev said he had not plans
to take action against the investigators or the magazine Ogonyok,
which published their charges June 26.
   Publication of the charges against unidentified delegates caused
a storm of criticism by delegates to the four-day conference that
ended Friday in the Kremlin.
   On Thursday, Ogonyok editor Vitaly Korotich personally turned
over to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev papers that he said
proved the charges. He told the conference that an overlapping
system of party and court control prevented the suspects from being
brought to justice.
   Asked about the case at a news briefing Monday, Sukharev said
the investigators ``abused their authority'' by turning to Ogonyok
with their material.
   ``We have the principle that people are regarded as not guilty
in this country,'' he said. ``This is a constitutional principle.''
   Queried whether that meant he would be taking action against the
magazine, Sukharev said, ``I can say I don't have such an intention
as yet.''
   He said the matter still was being investigated and that his
office should be able to draw its final conclusions soon.
   Ogonoyok said investigators trying to unravel corruption in the
Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan came across evidence that four
delegates to the party conference had taken bribes.
   Stories this year have laid open systematic corruption that led
all the way to Yuri Churbanov, son-in-law of late President Leonid
I. Brezhnev.
   Sukharev said Ogonyok's report was true that some people tried
to block the investigation, but he added that there had been
arrests and convictions of such people.
   Churbanov, who served as first deputy interior minister, faces
trial soon on charges of bribery and abuse of power, the procurator
general said.

   Frazzled by freeways? Try Zen Buddhism.
   That's the advice two brothers are giving in ``Zen Driving,'' a
book that explores how harried motorists can enjoy life in the
not-so-fast lane.
   No religious conversion is necessary for this ``moving
meditation,'' say Kevin and Todd Berger. In Zen driving, they say,
you simply accept a traffic jam and become one with it.
   A master of the art might even learn to see all the honking and
crowding as a path to enlightenment _ a sort of nirvana on wheels.
   ``Zen driving is a heightened sense of awareness and
mindfulness,'' said Todd Berger, 39, a psychotherapist from Marin
County, in a weekend telephone interview.
   ``If somebody cuts you off, you simply acknowledge your anger
and then let it go,'' he said. ``You're aware of what you
experience, and you experience what you're aware of.''
   Todd and his brother Kevin, the 31-year-old editor of a rock
music magazine in San Francisco, hope anyone whose mind stalls over
that concept will buy their newly released book.
   It represents the culmination of a discovery that Todd, who has
been studying Zen since the late 1960s, made a dozen years ago.
   Spending three hours a day commuting from home to work near Los
Angeles, he found he had little time to do his ``zazen,'' the
technique of sitting meditation that is the core of Zen Buddhism.
So he decided to do it on the road.
   ``Not only did my driving ability improve, but I got to work
feeling a lot less uptight,'' he said.
   Kevin also learned the method _ or ``non-method,'' as his
brother calls it. A car enthusiast, he, too, found it relaxing even
though he is not a practicing Buddhist.
   ``Zen is a philosophy, not a religion,'' said Kevin, who drives
a late-model pickup truck. ``To be a Buddha behind the wheel
doesn't mean you have to take the plastic Jesus off your
dashboard.''
   In the book, the brothers Berger describe exercises on how to
practice the method. They advise letting go of emotions and
focusing on the ``feel'' of the wheel, the car, the road.
   Soon, they promise, the cursing, fist-shaking and heart-pounding
associated with car trips will be only a memory. And you can
converse and meditate at the same time.
   ``Babe Ruth was a colorful personality off the field, but at the
moment the pitcher released the ball you can be assured Babe Ruth
was nothing but experience and awareness,'' they write. ``And
that's how we want to be in traffic.''
   Todd now professes to commute almost effortlessly over the
Golden Gate Bridge to his office in San Francisco.
   In fact, being a practicing Buddhist, he's virtually
unflappable. But it does upset him that some have described ``Zen
Driving'' as esoteric. He hopes the book will be as useful for
Iowans as it is for those cruising L.A. freeways every day.
   ``It chagrins me that this is being labeled as a New Age book in
bookstores,'' he said. ``It was really designed to be a driving
book for the everyday driver. ... I guess most stores don't have a
`driving' section.''

   Police said Monday they had arrested
1,784 people in the first week of a scheduled 70-day anti-crime
campaign before the Olympics.
   During the one-week period that began June 27, there were 7,477
burglars, thieves, hooligans and other law offenders picked up,
police said.
   Of those detained, 1,784 were put under formal arrest for
prosecution, 553 were referred to summary courts for up to 30 days
of detention, and 5,140 were released with promises to face
questioning later, they said.
   Those picked up were mostly minor offenders.
   Anti-crime checks are routine in South Korea, and the current
crackdown is aimed at ensuring the Olympics, which begin Sept. 17,
are safe.

   Conservationists moved 10 captive
Philippine eagles to safer ground after fighting between government
forces and rebels raged near a camp established to save the species.
   ``It made common sense to move although we might be sacrificing
the breeding cycle for 1988,'' said Ronald Kruppa, a consultant to
the Philippine Eagle Conservation Program.
   Kruppa, of Northbrook, Ill., said the eagles were moved Saturday
after at least 12 explosions near the breeding camp, which Kruppa
established in 1977.
   The explosions were from artillery fired by government forces at
hideouts of communist rebels.
   Kruppa moved the breeding camp closer to Davao City from the
foothills of Mount Apo, about 20 miles from Davao City and 600
miles southeast of Manila. The eagle is found only in the
Philippines and conservationists estimate there are only 300 of the
species left.

<TEXT>
   The governing Radical Civic Union
party overwhelmingly chose Gov. Eduardo Angeloz of Cordoba province
as its presidential candidate in 1989 elections, official returns
showed Monday.
   Angeloz, the handpicked candidate of party leader and President
Raul Alfonsin, on Sunday garnered 593,616 votes, or 88 percent, by
members of the centrist party, according to returns.
   The remaining 12 percent, or 81,088 votes, went to Sen. Luis
Leon of northern Chaco province and Carlos Yeregui.
   Alfonsin by law cannot run for re-election in the 1989
presidential elections.
   Members of the main opposition Justicialist (Peronist) Party
will chose its presidential candidate Saturday between Buenos Aires
province Gov. Antonio Cafiero and Gov. Carlos Menem of La Rioja
province.
   National elections are expected to be held in May or June 1989
to replace Alfonsin, whose election to a six-year term in 1983
ended nearly eight years of rightist military rule.
   Angeloz based his campaign on the need to improve the nation's
inflation-plagued economy, repay the $55 billion foreign debt and
continue Alfonsin's programs for economic deregulation and the
breakup of some state-run companies.
   Angeloz, 56, was one of the few party candidates to survive the
September elections in which Peronist and provincial candidates won
20 of the nation's 22 provincial governorships.
   The Peronists advocate a moratorium on the interest portion of
Argentina's foreign debt, third-largest in the developing world.

<HEAD>Reagan Says ``Great Difference'' Between KAL, Persian Gulf
Incident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan asserted Monday ``there was a
great difference'' between the U.S. Navy's destruction of an
Iranian commercial airliner and the Soviet Air Force's 1983
destruction of a Korean Air Lines jet.
   Vice President George Bush concurred. ``This plane was warned,''
he said, speaking of the Iranian jet downed Sunday by missiles from
the Navy cruiser Vincennes in the Strait of Hormuz.
   ``This plane was flying in a combat area. It's totally separate,
totally different,'' Bush told reporters in Wyandotte, Mich.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, agreed with Bush and Reagan, saying that unlike the
Korean jet, the Iranian plane had been warned on both civilian and
military frequencies.
   ``There are a lot of differences between the two situations,''
he said in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   The comparison between the two incidents was raised immediately
after U.S. officials said the Vincennes, thinking it was shooting
at an Iranian F-14, knocked Iran Air flight 655 into the Persian
Gulf.
   KAL flight 007, a Boeing 747 enroute from Anchorage, Alaska, to
Seoul, South Korea, was shot down by the Soviets on Sept. 1, 1983.
It was hit by an air-to-air missile fired by a Soviet fighter.
   The KAL shootdown was first revealed by the United States, which
released intercepted tape recordings of the Soviet pilot telling
his ground controller that ``the target is destroyed.''
   At the time, Reagan criticized ``the barbarity of the Soviet
government in shooting down an unarmed plane'' and U.S. officials
asserted that the Soviets knew they were shooting at a commercial
airliner.
   The Soviet reaction Monday was less critical. Gennady Gerasimov,
a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said the Soviets didn't
intend to follow the ``bad example'' of ``wild'' criticism.
   Gerasimov said the U.S. explanation that the Vincinnes mistook
the Iranian plane for an F-14 jet ``appeared to be strange. It
shows American naval officers were not very competent, or to use an
American phrase, trigger-happy.''
   Reagan, asked Monday about comparisons between the two
incidents, repeated the assertion that the Soviets knew they were
targeting a commercial plane. ``Remember the KAL, a group of Soviet
fighter planes went up, identified the plane for what it was and
then proceeded to shoot it down. There's no comparison,'' he said
at the White House.
   The KAL plane was shot down after flying over restricted Soviet
airspace, first above the Kamchatka peninsula and later over
Sakhalin island. The plane crashed into the Sea of Japan.
   Initially, the Soviets refused to admit they had shot at a
commercial plane, asserting that the plane was on a reconnaissance
mission. A week later, the Soviets said they had down the plane,
but said the Soviet pilot had not known it was a commercial craft.
   The Soviets also said the Su-15 jet had fired warning rounds at
the KAL plane before the missile was launched, an assertion first
disputed by the United States and later accepted.
   U.S. officials also asserted that the well-known shape and size
of the 747 made it difficult to mistake for another plane, but the
Soviets said their jet was below and behind the plane and it was
dark, meaning it couldn't be visually identified.
   In addition, the Soviets asserted they were targeting an
American reconnaissance plane and four days after the KAL plane was
downed, U.S. officials admitted that a U.S. RC-135 plane had been
in the general area of the KAL jetliner when the 747 was near the
Kamchatka peninsula. The RC-135 is a military version of the Boeing
707.
   Crowe said Sunday there were ``fundamental differences'' between
the two incidents.
   The KAL shootdown ``was not (in) a war zone, there was not
combat in progress, there was not combat there generally,'' Crowe
said. ``And, secondly, the KAL 007 was not warned in any way, form
or fashion. Nor, as far as I can tell or determine, was any attempt
made to warn.''
   But Crowe's statement is at odds with State Department
statements.
   Although originally asserting the KAL plane wasn't warned, the
State Department later changed that assessment, shortly after the
Soviets asserted there had been warning shots fired.
   On Sept. 11, 1983, the State Department said ``additional
analysis of the tapes'' indicate that the Soviet pilot told his
ground controllers that he had fired his cannons nearly six minutes
before the missiles were launched.

   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty left for the
Persian Gulf on Monday to carry out President Reagan's order to
investigate what led the USS Vincennes tp blast an Iranian airliner
from the sky, killing all 290 people aboard.
   Fogarty was heading a six-member team that will interview
officers, including Capt. Will C. Rogers III, 50, commander of the
warship, and review data stored in the the $1 billion ship's
sophisticated Aegis radar and computer system, said Lt. Col. Dave
Titus, a military spokesman.
   Fogarty left at 8 a.m. EDT from MacDill Air Force Base, home of
the U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base, near Tampa,
Fla., and headquarters for American forces operating in the Persian
Gulf, said Titus, reached by telephone at MacDill.
   Accompanying Fogarty were experts on topics ranging the Aegis
system to operations and ``a lawyer as counsel on matters concering
the Uniform Code of Military Justice,'' said Titus, describing the
presence of the attorney as ``standard.''
   Fogarty is director of plans and policy at Central Command,
according to a biography, which did not list his age. Navy and
Pentagon officials were not immediately able to provide his date of
birth.
   Fogarty is a native of Des Moines, Iowa, and entered the Navy
through the Rerserve Officers Training Course at the Iowa State
University Science and Technology in 1958.
   He graduated from the German Command and Staff College, in
Hamburg, West Germany, in 1971, obtained a masters degree in
international affairs from George Washington University in
Washington, D.C., in 1975, and took part in the international
affairs program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.
   Fogarty commanded destroyer squadrons in the Mediterranean Sea
before being assigned in September 1981 as commanding officer of
the USS New Jersey, the first of the battleships recommissioned
under President Reagan's military buildup.
   He is married to the former Dawn Purvis of Norfolk, Va.

   President Reagan stood fast Monday behind his
policy of defending the right of free navigation in the Persian
Gulf, a position supported by members of Congress as Washington
weighed the impact of the U.S. downing of an Iranian passenger
plane.
   ``We want peace in the Gulf but we also want the right of
navigation of international waters,'' Reagan told reporters after
returning to the White House from a weekend stay at his retreat in
Camp David, Md.
   Asked whether U.S. ships will stay in the Gulf, Reagan said,
``Yes.''
   Meanwhile, members of Congress interviewed Monday generally
agreed that the United States should maintain its military presence
in the Gulf in the wake of Sunday's tragedy, in which 290 lives
were lost.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., said it would be a
``great mistake'' for the United States to abruptly withdraw its
forces from the Gulf.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, a member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said, ``I think our policy to maintain freedom of
navigation of the seas, to respond to third country vessels in
distress upon request is a sound policy and one that will remain. I
do hope that out of this will come a reinvigorated effort to try to
get peace. U.S. interests in the Gulf will best be protected if we
can stop the war.''
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said the administration should review
its Gulf policy because the next time a tragedy occurs, American
lives may be lost instead of Iranian. He stopped short, however, of
calling for a U.S. withdrawal.
   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson said the United
States has a right to have military forces stationed in
international waters of the Persian Gulf and ``we should not move
out unilaterally.''
   But he indicated the administration should seek ways to bring
its forces home.
   ``The policy is without end,'' he said. ``To what end are we
there?''
   State Department officials, insisting on anonymity, left open
the possibility that there may be a review of the rules specifying
when U.S. military commanders in the Gulf are permitted to engage
in hostile action.
   The commanders were given greater latitude in taking such action
a year ago after a Iranian jet fired on the frigate USS Stark,
killing 37 crewmen.
   On Monday, the State Department continued to make a studied
effort to avoid the appearance of a crisis atmosphere. There was no
requirement for any major decisions to be made, and all senior
officials took off for the July 4 holiday, the sources said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz was on a holiday weekend
outside of Washington and was planning to go ahead with a planned
2{-week trip to Asia starting Tuesday morning.
   The only reported diplomatic activity was the dispatch of
messages to some foreign governments explaining that the shooting
down of the Iranian plane was a case of mistaken identity, the
officials said.
   It was unclear whether the administration planned an apology
beyond the expression of deep regret Sunday by Adm. William Crowe,
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Reagan's description of
the incident as a ``terrible human tragedy.''
   Another unresolved issue is whether the administration should
pay reparations to families of the victims. Officials recalled that
at the time of the downing of Korean Airlines flight 007 by Soviet
jet fighters, the administration had called on Moscow to pay
compensation to the victims' families.
   Reagan acknowledged that the possibility of Iranian retaliation
was a concern for the administration.
   ``You have to think about that knowing who they are,'' he said.
   Interiewed on the Cable News Network, Mohammad Ja'afar
Mahallati, Iran's ambassdor to the United Nations, called Sunday's
incident a ``blatant act of terrorism'' that should be ``severely
punished.''
   The incident occurred at a time when the United States had been
exploring the possibility of pursuing a dialogue with Iran.
Although U.S. officials had denied reports of secret meetings
between American and Iranian envoys, the two countries are said to
have exchanged messages in recent weeks.
   Robin Wright, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said she was told by Iranian officials during
a recent visit to Tehran that the reported exchanges provided a
``hopeful sign'' on a variety of issues.
   But the prospects for any improvement in relations appear dashed
for the time being as a result of the airliner incident.
   The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April
1980 during the period in which American diplomats were held
hostage in Iran.

   An annual rock extravaganza in this
Danish town drew more than 60,000 people, Western stars and groups
from developing countries, but a major ingredient was still
missing: artists from the flourishing rock scene in the Soviet bloc.
   Three hundred acts played this year's Roskilde Festival,
including Sting, Canadian Bryan Adams, Australia's INXS and Leonard
Cohen of the United States.
   Only two minor acts were from Eastern Europe.
   ``Most of the bands from the communist countries play
10-year-old copies of what we all know,'' said Leif Skov, the
festival's chief booking agent.
   ``However, if we want to develop further, this is a corner
that's not been covered yet,'' Skov told The Associated Press.
   The festival, a major fixture on the European music scene,
closed Sunday with the second-largest attendance in its 18-year
history. Visitors came from Scandinavia, Britain and West Germany,
organizers said.
   Under ``glasnost,'' the openness policy of Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, Soviet rock music is enjoying more freedom than ever,
with many formerly banned bands now playing.
   The estimated number of rock bands in the Soviet Union is
30,000, with about 300 of them playing professionally, a Danish
newspaper reported recently.
   Two Soviet bands were in Denmark in May, said the Amtavisen
Randers daily. Both came in their free time and paid their own
expenses to give promotional performances.
   ``It cost me 1,200 rubles (about $1,400) to be here, but to me
Denmark is worth much more,'' Oleg Gusev, lead singer of the
Leningrad-based rock group Avgust was quoted as saying.
   In previous years the festival has had a few acts from Poland
and some Hungarian bands.
   ``The problem is that it takes at least two years of paperwork
to negotiate a deal in those countries,'' said Nils Traeden, a
talent scout involved in the festival. ``They simply must be more
flexible than that to make it here.''
   Vladimir Merta, a folk singer from Czechoslovakia, made it to
Roskilde after a two-year ban on his music was lifted in his home
country. The other East bloc performance was from a folk group from
Hungary.
   ``This is a marketplace for different ideas and influences, with
enthusiastic crowds pushing you to do things you never tried
before,'' Merta said in an interview.
   Boris Grebenshchikov, the leader of the Soviet band, Aquarium,
recently signed a deal with CBS records to sell his recordings in
the United States.
   ``The way Western audiences perceive rock music is still quite
narrow, and heavily dominated by the American influence,'' Skov
said. ``One of the purposes of this festival is to do something
about it.''
   In previous years some of the profits were contributed to
various charities, including Amnesty International and the
Britain-based World of Music Arts and Dance.
   ``We'd like to have some of the Soviet or East bloc bands
involved in that, too,'' Skov said.

   In 39.5 seconds, Dyk Fink eased his
prized 1974 McCullough chain saw through a 30-inch log in a shower
of sawdust that left fellow loggers shaking their heads in
admiration.
   ``I come here with a stock engine and I beat 'em all,'' the
56-year-old veteran logger said with a beaming grin.
   Fink became six-time champion of the North Fork Loggers'
Jamboree on Saturday. The event has been held officially for 29
years in these foothills 50 miles north of Fresno.
   For two days the roar of huge chain saws ripped through this
pine and oak-studded canyon in the Sierra Nevada 200 miles
southeast of San Francisco in a celebration of logging, the town's
economic mainstay.
   Proceeds from the jamboree benefit the recreation center;
earlier events raised enough money to buy the 11-acre community
center site.
   ``This is one of the better shows, I tell ya,'' said Herb
Punkin, 57, who's made the circuit of loggers' jamborees up and
down the West Coast.
   During Saturday's pro-am competition, Fink was a hometown
favorite. He and partner Doug Betty, competing in the stock team
saw, sliced a 30-inch log in 1 minute 46.54 seconds and cut through
an 18-inch log with a double-handsaw in 29.95 seconds.
   ``He's the Paul Bunyan of the town,'' observed John Somerville,
another competitor.
   Fink, who resembles a jovial Jonathan Winters, showed his style
in the ``jackpot'' or working chain saw event. After noisily
warming up his saw, Fink turned it off and waited for an official's
starting cue.
   First, he bored the 32-inch blade through the middle of the log,
then cut downward and then back up to finish the first cut, as a
plume of sawdust flew onto an official's T-shirt. Just as a round
of freshly cut lumber hit the dirt, Fink had the saw moving down
for the second cut.
   Three officials with electronic stopwatches, sitting in the dirt
arena, clocked Fink's fluid movement. When the second cut fell
down, Fink pulled back the power tool to the cheers of several
hundred spectators, clustered in the shade of large sugar pines.
   Later, under the shade of the announcer's booth, Fink received
hearty slaps on his sweat-drenched work shirt.
   On Sunday the pros arrived from logging towns all over
California to compete for $2,500 in prize money. Among the events
was hurling a double-butted axe 20 feet at a thick pine round. A
logger who hits the bullseye, a full beer can snugly tucked into
the center, sets off a gusher of white beer foam.
   Other events included ladies power saw, tree falling, hand
chopping and ``Jack and Jill,'' or men and women teamed up with a
six-foot hand saw.

   Storms and flooding have killed 65 people and
injured 1,420 others in China's southwestern Sichuan province, it
was reported Monday.
   In a broadcast monitored in Hong Kong, Beijing's official Xinhua
News Agency said the flooding took place in 36 counties late last
month.
   Provincial officials quoted the agency as saying 1,341 head of
livestock, 358,891 acres of crops, 100 small hydroelectric stations
and thousands of houses were destroyed,
   The agency said that officials estimated the loss at about $76
million.
   According to Xin Hua, the flooding forced schools, shops and
factories to shut down.
   Provincial government officials and rescue workers were rushed
to the devastated areas to carry out relief operations.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Monday
he will ``donate my worthless life'' to fighting the United States
after an American warship shot down an Iranian jetliner and killed
all aboard.
   Iranian navy divers searched for more bodies from the Iran Air
Airbus 300 that was destroyed Sunday while on a flight from Bandar
Abbas to Dubai, across the Strait of Hormuz.
   Leaders of the Iranian clergy and military demanded revenge for
the deaths of the 290 people aboard the jet, most of whom were
Iranians.
   The 87-year-old Khomeini said: ``We must all be prepared for a
real war and go to the war fronts and fight against America and its
lackeys. I donate my worthless life for the sake of our victory.''
   Iran accuses the United States, which it calls the Great Satan,
of being Iraq's sponsor in the war between the Persian Gulf
neighbors that began in September 1980.
   In the statement read on Tehran radio, Khomeini referred to a
message sent him by Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, his designated
heir, asking the revolutionaary patriarch to sanction war on the
United States.
   ``Fighting a full-scale war against America cannot be (done) by
slogans and propaganda campaigns alone,'' Montazeri declared. He
said the nation needs plans for ``a principled fight against the
main enemy, America, on the political, economic, cultural and
military fronts.''
   Iran often has promised to wage war against the United States
following clashes between the two nations in the Persian Gulf since
U.S. forces began escorting commercial vessels in the waterway last
summer.
   State television in Tehran began its evening news program with
the two statements and scenes of protest it said were occurring
throughout Iran. Mass funeral services for those on the jet are
scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in Tehran.
   The Iranian mission to the United Nations in Geneva demanded
that U.S. military personnel responsible for the attack be tried,
that Washington pay ``full compensation,'' and that U.S. forces be
withdrawn from the gulf.
   Ambassador Sirous Nasseri delivered the note during a meeting
with Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general. To
reporters, Nasseri read a statement describing as ``ridiculous''
the official U.S. position that the airliner was destroyed because
the crew of the the USS Vincennes mistook it for an Iranian F-14
fighter.
   ``The attack, contrary to the claims by the United States, is
indeed a deliberate one,'' he said.
   Perez de Cuellar said the destruction of the jet ``appears to
have been a tragic error'' and asked for ``the greatest restraint
in these difficult moments for the peace and security of the
region.''
   Iranian news reports said 168 bodies had been recovered and the
search area in the southern gulf had been expanded.
   The commander of the search and rescue operation said bodies had
been recovered up to five miles from the area where most of the
jetliner's debris fell. It was hit at 7,500 feet by at least one of
two missiles fired by the Vincennes, a guided missile cruiser.
   Reports from Tehran quoted the unidentified commander as saying
currents may have swept bodies away from the wreckage. The plane
was hit about 30 miles south of Bandar Abbas, a coastal city, off
Iran's Hengam Island.
   He said frogmen were looking for missile fragments at a depth of
about 100 feet.
   According to the Iranian reports, the 38 bodies of foreigners
recovered were those of 12 United Arab Emirates citizens, eight
Indians, eight Pakistanis, six Yugoslavs, two Kuwaitis, an Italian
and an Afghan.
   Military and aviation officials in Iran denied American
statements that the plane was outside civilian aviation corridors.
   U.S. military spokesmen said the image on radar screens appeared
to be that of an F-14 Tomcat fighter, the plane did not respond to
warnings and it appeared to dive toward the ship. The United States
supplied F-14s to Iran before Khomeini's revolution overthrew the
monarchy in February 1979.
   The plane began the short flight to Dubai just after an
engagement in the Strait of Hormuz in which the Vincennes and
another Navy ship, the Montgomery, sank two Iranian attack boats
and damaged a third.
   Brig. Gen. Mansour Sattari, commander of the Iranian air force,
said statements by Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, were ``a pack of lies in a bid to justify the
inhuman crime.''
   Crowe told reporters Sunday in Washington ``the suspect aircraft
was outside the prescribed commercial air corridor.''
   In Rome, an Italian Navy spokesman said officers on an Italian
frigate near the scene said it tracked the airliner on radar and
noted it was flying outside the civilian air corridor.
   Sattari said: ``It is quite easy to distinguish a huge Airbus
passenger plane from a tiny F-14 jet fighter.''
   Iran Air announced it had suspended flights between Bandar Abbas
and Dubai, and Dubai said it would stop Gulf Air flights to Bandar
Abbas. Japan Air Lines and Cathay Pacific Airways said they would
alter their routes over the gulf.

   A Vietnamese immigrant who fled Saigon just
before it fell won a competition Monday to design New Jersey's
Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and he thanked American soldiers for
rescuing his family.
   ``I feel like I've done something good,'' Hien T. Nguyen said at
a ceremony on the grassy knoll at the Garden State Arts Center
where the memorial will be built.
   ``I want to thank the country for taking us in and making us
Americans,'' said Nguyen, 35, an architect from Marlboro whose
entry was selected from 425 proposals.
   Speaking of the nation's Vietnam veterans, he said, ``If not for
them, I might not be here today. They gave us new life. We are the
lucky ones.''
   Soon after, he announced that he was donating his $5,000
winner's check to fund efforts to find and return soldiers missing
in action and reunite Amerasian children with their American
parents.
   Nguyen's memorial design features a 9-foot-high panel of black
granite lining the interior of a 200-foot-diameter oval. The
granite will be inscribed with the names of 1,419 New Jersey
residents killed in Vietnam and 63 missing in action. A New Jersey
oak tree will stand in the center of the memorial.
   About 200 veterans and their families at the ceremony applauded
Nguyen's work and some in uniforms embraced him.
   Sal Mione, a veteran who was on the committee that selected
Nguyen's design, said the memorial would ``start the healing and
bring together New Jersey veterans the way the Vietnam Memorial in
Washington did for American veterans.''
   Nguyen, who became a U.S. citizen five years ago, was evacuated
from Saigon in an American airlift on April 30, 1975, with his
mother and sister. They were taken to a refugee camp in Arkansas
before Nguyen moved to Blacksburg, Va., where his brother Han was a
student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, which Nguyen also
attended.
   ``I think it has special meaning,'' Han Nguyen, 37, said of his
brother's design. ``He really believed in doing something for the
people that went'' to Vietnam.
   ``You can tell this is from the heart,'' said Glenn Guarino of
Toms Rivers, one of five honor guards from Chapter 200 of the New
Jersey Vietnam Veterans of America. ``You can tell the emotion he
put into the memorial.''
   Added colleague Andrew Marotta, of Brick Township, who broke
down briefly: ``This place will be sacred because our brothers will
be here.''
   Nguyen's $2.5 million design will be financed by a variety of
sources, including veterans' groups, private corporations and the
state, said state Sen. Edward O'Connor, chairman of the memorial
committee.
   Groundbreaking will not take place until most of the money is
raised and construction will take one year, said Tom Moran, visual
arts coordinator for the state Council on the Arts and the
competition's manager.
   Moran said a four-member panel of architects, artists and
designers picked the seven finalists from among more than 400
entries.
   Moran said Nguyen's design ``provides a space for solitude. When
you enter, you must be overcome by a wall of stone that provides
seclusion and private moments away from the outside world.''
   Nguyen said he visited the war memorial in Washington and read
books by Vietnam veterans to get a sense of how they felt about the
war.

<HEAD>Jackson Says U.S. Should Pay Reparations To Iranians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson urged President Reagan on Monday to
offer reparations to the families of victims of the downed Iranian
airliner, saying an immediate goodwill gesture was needed to save
the lives of American hostages held in Lebanon.
   Jackson called for an investigation and re-evaluation of U.S.
policy in the Persian Gulf. He held a brief news conference at his
Chicago home before departing for Boston for a Fourth of July visit
with Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson criticized what he called the administration's ``failed
and vague policy'' in the gulf.
   Reagan said the U.S. Navy's shooting down of the Iranian
jetliner with 290 people aboard was ``an understandable accident''
and ordered a full investigation by the Defense Department. The
Pentagon said the airliner was mistaken for an attacking warplane,
and failed to heed warnings.
   But Jackson said the administration was using ``the same
arguments the Russians were making'' after they shot down a Korean
Air Lines jetliner in 1983, killing all 269 people on board.
   ``When the KAL (plane) was shot down, we did not accept those
arguments as being valid, and most people in the world will not
accept our arguments to this point as being valid,'' Jackson said.
   The Democratic presidential candidate said there was ``no
evidence'' that the USS Vincennes was under attack when it shot
down the civilian airliner early Sunday.
   ``I am sincerely concerned that we make a gesture of goodwill
immediately so as to protect the lives of Americans who are in the
region, specifically the Americans who are held hostage there,'' he
said.
   Jackson said the incident complicates the situation in the gulf
at a time when there were indications that forces in Iran favoring
negotiations were gaining strength.
   Reading a prepared statement, Jackson urged Reagan to go on
television to express ``genuine regrets'' about the plane's downing
and ``offer reparations to the families to ease some of the pain.''
   The president has already expressed deep regret over the loss of
life.
   Jackson called for a United Nations force under international
command to keep the gulf waterways open, rather than rely on
unilateral U.S. military actions. However, the navies of several
other nations are also patrolling in the gulf.
   The Reagan administration's policy left U.S. troops ``trapped in
the gulf under these warlike conditions without civilian
oversight,'' Jackson said.

   The Communist Party says every Soviet citizen has
an ``inalienable right'' to any information on public affairs but
state and military secrets, the Tass news agency reported Monday.
   In one of a series of resolutions adopted at last week's party
conference, the delegates said any citizen attacked in the press
should have the right to respond in the same newspaper.
   The Soviet press also must not publish ``unobjective information
injurious to a citizen's honor and dignity,'' Tass said in
summarizing the resolutions.
   The national conference, the party's first since 1941, was
called by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to chart political reforms and
reassess the role of the 20 million-member party in Soviet life.
   As well as setting certain limits for the Kremlin policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness, the 5,000-member conference decreed a
sweeping agenda of political and legal reform.
   The Central Committee, the party's policy-making body, will meet
at the end of July to discuss how to put the conference's
resolutions into effect, Tass said.
   Further indicating the speed with which the Soviet leadership
wants to move, the Politburo, the party's supreme body, held an
extraordinary Monday session to discuss how to fulfill the
resolutions.
   The 13-member body led by Gorbachev ordered all party and
government bodies to ``act without delay'' in implementing the
decisions of the conference, which ended Friday.
   Gorbachev, the party's general secretary, has repeatedly said
past efforts at reform failed because they were not accomplished by
political changes.
   As summarized by Tass, the party conference's resolutions:
   _ State that more openness ``is an indispensable condition for
unfolding the processes of democratizing every aspect of life and
updating socialism.'' But they say the press is not free to act
``to the detriment of the interests of the Soviet state and
society.''
   _ Acknowledge that Gorbachev's program for political and social
restructuring, known as ``perestroika,'' is proceeding more slowly
than planned. ``Many causes of all this are to be sought in the
flaws of the present work of the party, government and economic
bodies and public organizations.''
   _ Attach ``prime importance to improving drastically food
supplies to the population.'' The shortest route to that goal, the
conference said, is for bureaucrats to stop meddling in the
operations of collective and state farms.
   _ Give ``top priority'' to sweeping political reform, including
a 10-year limit on the tenure of elected party and government
officials and a reinforced role for the governing councils, who
often were supplanted in practice by local party committees.
   Party officials have said the political changes include the
creation of a full-time legislature and of a more powerful
presidency that could be filled by the 57-year-old Gorbachev
himself.
   Other resolutions adopted include instructions on fighting
bureaucracy, reforming the legal system and changing the apparatus
of the party.
   The delegates to the four-day conference rejected the legacy of
totalitarian methods bequeathed by dictator Josef Stalin, and also
repudiated the complacency and corruption now viewed as endemic
under the reign of President Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   The party, the resolutions said, ``shall never allow the
repetition of anything similar to what is associated with the
periods of the cult of personality and stagnation, which caused
profound deformations in socialist society, retarded its
development for whole decades and brought about immense human
casualties and immeasurable moral and ideological losses.''
   In a further break with Stalin's legacy, the Politburo on Monday
approved the construction of a monument in Moscow to the victims of
``illegality and repression'' during the 29 years Stalin led the
nation.
   Gorbachev had proposed at the conference that such a memorial be
built, and said Friday: ``This would be an honest step, and it will
be supported by the entire Soviet people.''
   At the conference, some delegates had called for publication of
the responsibilities of members of the party hierarchy, which until
now had not been mentioned by state-run media.
   The communique on Monday's Politburo meeting, distributed by
Tass, spelled out for the first time which leaders had been charged
with specific tasks by the ruling body.
   Apparently heeding some delegates' complaints that food supplies
were wholly inadequate in some regions, the Politburo directed
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, fellow Politburo member Viktor P.
Nikonov and other officials to improve food production and supply.

   Michael Dukakis on Monday urged Iran to reconsider its threats
to use terrorism to avenge the U.S. shooting down of an Iranian
jetliner with 290 people aboard. George Bush expressed his regrets
about the tragedy, but said the incident should not change U.S.
policy in the Persian Gulf.
   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, urged President Reagan to offer
reparations to the families of victims of the downed Iranian jet,
saying an immediate goodwill gesture was needed to save the lives
of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson later focused their attention on the
Democratic ticket, meeting for dinner at the Massachusetts
governor's Brookline home and later attending Boston's Independence
Day celebrations.
   Aides to the likely Democratic nominee described the evening as
a social gathering, but said Dukakis' search for a running mate
would likely be discussed.
   Jackson has said he has decided whether he would accept a vice
presidential offer, but refuses to disclose his decision. He
contends that he deserves to be offered the No. 2 spot on the
ticket.
   Dukakis has said Jackson is being considered but says he owes no
candidate an offer.
   At the Charlestown Navy Yard, Dukakis departed from the prepared
text of a Fourth of July speech to appeal to Iran not to try to
seek revenge through terrorism. He renewed his call for an
international effort to end the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   ``While we all deeply regret the tragedy, this is no time for
acts of terror or revenge in response to the incident,'' Dukakis
said at the berth of the USS Constitution. ``So I urge the
government of Iran to reconsider its threats and to join us and the
entire international community to ending a war that already has
taken the lives of more than one million people.''
   Mohammad Ja-Afar Mahallati, Iranian ambassador to the United
Nations, said the downing of the Iran Air Airbus was premeditated
and he called it ``cold-blooded murder.''
   ``By definition, it was an act of terrorism that ... should be
severely punished,'' he said.
   The USS Vincennes shot down the commercial jetliner on Sunday
while engaged in battle with Iranian gunboats. The Pentagon said
the Vincennes crew believed the wide-bodied Airbus was a smaller
F-14 fighter about to attack the ship.
   ``Clearly, we have the right to defend our forces against
imminent threat, and apparently the shooting down of the airliner
occurred over what appears to have been an unprovoked attack
against our forces,'' Dukakis said.
   Vice President Bush, campaigning in the Midwest, spoke out for
the first time on the incident, expressing deep regret.
   ``Obviously, as we celebrate our great national holiday our
hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were lost
and also (hearts) go out to those kids, those young Americans who
are defending freedom halfway around the world,'' he said.
   The all-but-certain Republican nominee said he believed U.S.
policy in the gulf will remain the same. ``Life goes on, our
mission goes on and the world keeps turning,'' Bush said.
   The vice president continued his campaign schedule, saying
``there is nothing I can be doing about this matter in Washington
D.C.''
   However, Bush planned to attend a White House briefing on the
gulf incident on Tuesday, according to aides.
   Prior to leaving Chicago for his meeting with Dukakis, Jackson
said the shooting incident complicates the situation in the gulf
region at a time when there were indications that forces in Iran
favoring negotiations were gaining strength.
   ``I am sincerely concerned that we make a gesture of goodwill
immediately so as to protect the lives of Americans who are in the
region, specifically the Americans who are held hostage there,'' he
said.
   Jackson urged Reagan to go on television to express ``genuine
regrets'' about the plane's downing and ``offer reparations to the
families to ease some of the pain.'' The president has already said
he deeply regrets the loss of life.
   Jackson also called on the Reagan administration to re-evaluate
its Middle East policy but said the United States should maintain a
presence in the war-torn gulf.
   ``We should not move out unilaterally. The fact is they are
international waters. We do have a right to be there,'' Jackson
said.

   On a lighter note, a blueblood directory in London said Bush is
a distant cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and has blood ties with
every other European royal family on or off the throne.
   The directory, Burke's Peerage, found that Bush is a 13th cousin
twice removed of Britain's current monarch, and is a direct
descendant of King Henry VII, of one of Charles II's mistresses and
of Henry VIII's younger sister, Mary, who married King Louis XII of
France.
   ``Mr. Bush is without doubt connected to more great royal
families than any reigning head of state today except His Serene
Highness Franz Josef of Liechtenstein,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker,
director of Burke's Peerage.

   Officials of the 101-nation non-aligned
movement observed a minute of silence on Monday to remember the
passengers who were killed when a U.S. Navy ship shot down an
Iranian jetliner.
   The officials are meeting in the capital of Harare to prepare
for a two-day session of the movement's Ministerial Committee on
Economic Cooperation scheduled to open Wednesday.
   The preparatory talks are being chaired by Zimbabwe's permanent
representative to the United Nations, Stan Mudenge, who asked the
officials to stand in silence in memory of those who perished in
the attack.
   Iran, a member of the non-aligned movement, is expected to
attend the ministerial meeting Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The head of the Greek Orthodox Church in the
Western Hemisphere referred Monday to the presidential ambitions of
Gov. Michael Dukakis as an example of Greek-Americans seeking
``loftier goals.''
   Early Greek Orthodox settlers in the United States had to
overcome persecution, Archbishop Iakovos said in his remarks to
nearly 3,500 followers at a biennial conference.
   Today, Iakovos said, the United States is ``a country
resplendent with successful Greek Orthodox believers and citizens.
   ``They (the settlers) see a generation still ascending towards
loftier goals, a Greek-American young man standing at the pinnacle
of an incredible political ascendancy told only in fairy tales.''
   Iakovos commented in delivering the keynote address at the 29th
Clergy-Laity Congress of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North
and South America.
   The biennial conference comprises workshops and discussions
about church-related issues and policies.
   Iakovos also noted the increasing religious freedom in the
Soviet Union where, he said, ``The pulpit has come out of its sad
silence.''
   The religious leader of some 3 million people from Canada to
Argentina said such examples should foster more faith.
   Before the meeting ends Thursday, it will be addressed by
Dukakis and Vice President George Bush, the likely Republican
presidential nominee.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of residents from two towns were
evacuated as toxic chemicals spewed from a plant fire, which
firefighters brought under control Monday.
   The blaze, which followed an explosion, at Polymer Applications
Co. burned out of control late Sunday night because firefighters
feared more explosions of the chemical tanks that surround the
company, police said. Firefighters resumed their efforts after
flames that shot 100 feet into the air died down.
   Meanwhile, 300 residents of the Buffalo suburbs of Tonawanda and
Grand Island were evacuated and hundreds of others advised to close
their windows and stay indoors, said Patrick Roach of the Tonawanda
Police Department.
   Police also evacuated a local park where people had gathered for
Fourth of July festivities, he said.
   Authorities said more than 100 people, including 40
firefighters, were taken to local hospitals for treatment of smoke
inhalation and released.
   John Szuchs of Tonawanda said an explosion shook his home and
when he went outside, ``I couldn't breathe. It was scary.''
   Sue Jackson of Grand Island said residents had to fight panic:
``All we could think of was that something terrible was happening.''
   Police put up residents in local fire halls for the night.
   The fire was controlled Monday about 7 a.m., firefighters said.
Authorities were still investigating and trying to determine what
chemicals had burned.
   Company President Kevin Green said the $7.5 million plant was
destroyed and that 70 people would lose their jobs.
   Green said the fire started after a cap blew off a pressurized
reactor vessel. A handful of workers were in the building at the
time and all escaped uninjured, he said.
   He said the fire started because a worker apparently had not be
``careful enough.'' He did not elaborate.
   The company makes compounds used in the manufacture of brake
linings, insulation and paints. Company officials said the
compounds contain toxic phenols.

<HEAD>Environmental Agency To Increase Monitoring Of Mississippi River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State environmental officials say they
will monitor the Mississippi River more closely for salt and toxic
substances as the worst drought in years continues to decrease the
freshwater flow.
   ``We're concerned about the toxics going down the river and are
seriously taking a look at it now,'' said Maureen O'Neill, the
Department of Environmental Quality's assistant secretary in charge
of water quality. ``We're not seeing the same dilution factor''
that is normally present.
   So far, levels of toxic substances still are very low, but the
environmental agency will begin taking weekly samples from the
river instead of the monthly tests that are normally taken, O'Neill
said. Public warnings will be issued if toxic levels are found to
be unacceptable, she said.
   The department is getting help in analyzing the samples from the
New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board's laboratory because its own
laboratory is understaffed and backed up with other work, O'Neill
said.
   Meanwhile, communities that get their drinking water from the
lower part of the Mississippi River are seeing chloride
concentrations rise as salt water moves rapidly up the river due to
a lack of freshwater flow.
   At Port Sulphur, drinking water already is nearly double the
federal standard for chlorides.

   Ryan White, the teen-age AIDS patient who
captured national attention with his struggle to attend school,
urged teachers Monday to use education to make his illness ``a
disease, not a dirty word.''
   Looking small for his 16 years but relatively fit except for a
sniffle, White told some 8,000 delegates to the National Education
Association's annual convention that despite his 3{-year struggle
with the disease, ``my life is better now.''
   ``I'm a normal happy teen-ager again. I have a driver's license
and a 1987 Chevy. I attend sports functions and dances. My studies
are important to me. I made the honor role recently, with two As
and two Bs,'' he said.
   ``I have lived 3{ years with AIDS. Now I stand before you to ask
for your help,'' Ryan told the teachers. ``The many people against
me said they weren't against me, but against my disease. Help me
beat the odds and together let's educate and save the children of
the world.''
   ``Teachers can play an important role in helping an AIDS student
be accepted and treated as normal as possible by teaching the
facts, not the myths,'' he said. ``By proper education, AIDS can be
a disease, not a dirty word.''
   The NEA went on record last year in opposition to mandatory or
involuntary AIDS testing of students. Union delegates will vote
later this week on a resolution in support of local policies to
ensure ``free appropriate public education'' for students with AIDS.
   A hemophiliac since birth, Ryan caught AIDS from blood products
he was given to control his disease.
   Ryan's health has improved since last year when he started
taking the drug AZT, which helps prolong the lives of AIDS victims
but doesn't cure them.
   He now attends Hamilton Heights High School in Arcadia, Ind.,
and hopes to graduate in 1991. He told reporters after his address
that he's spending the summer working at a skateboard shop in
Indianapolis and would like to attend the University of Indiana.
   His outlook was far bleaker 3{ years ago when his family lived
in Kokomo, Ind., and he faced taunts and discrimination because of
his illness.
   After he was diagnosed, Kokomo school officials banned him from
classes. After nine months of court battles he won the right to
attend school, only to find more problems.
   ``Because of the lack of education on AIDS, discrimination,
fear, panic and lies surrounded me,'' he said. ``I became the
target of Ryan White jokes, lies about me biting people, spitting
on vegetables and cookies, urinating on bathroom walls. Some
restaurants threw away my dishes. My school locker was vandalized
inside and folders were marked `Fag' and other obscenities.''
   ``I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I
was not welcome anywhere. People would get up and leave so they
would not have to sit anywhere near me. Even at church, people
would not shake my hand,'' he said.
   Last year, his family decided to move 25 miles away to Cicero,
near Arcadia, where school officials used education to create a
welcoming atmosphere for Ryan and his family.
   ``For the first time in three years, we feel we have a home, a
supportive school and lots of friends,'' he said. ``Hamilton
Heights High School is proof that AIDS education in school works.''

<TEXT>
   A Shiite Moslem goes on trial
Tuesday for the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which a U.S.
Navy diver was slain, and several of the American passengers say
they're ready to take the stand.
   The trial for Mohammed Hamadi, charged with murder and air
piracy, begins amid high-security in a courtroom at a state prison
in Frankfurt.
   Four armed men hijacked the TWA plane on June 14, 1985, on a
flight from Athens to Rome, and forced it to land in Beirut.
Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days and U.S. Navy
diver Robert Stethem of Waldorf, Md., was beaten and shot to death.
   Several former U.S. captives aboard the TWA plane have been
asked to testify about the abuse at the hands of their abductors.
Scores have given depositions to West German prosecutors.
   ``I'm ready to go (to the trial),'' said Kurt L. Carlson, a
Chicago-area native who said he was beaten by the hijackers for two
consecutive hours.
   ``I feel strongly about what the hijackers did. All the beating
and the terror _ our lives were threatened every minute on that
plane,'' Carlson told the AP.
   The Frankfurt juvenile court will spend the first part of the
trial looking into the vital question of Hamadi's age, to determine
whether the Lebanese defendant should be tried as a juvenile, young
adult or adult.
   Under West German law, a juvenile is less than age 18, an adult
is age 21 and older, while a young adult is between 18 and 21.
   Hamadi faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if the
court convicts him as an adult at the time of the crime. The West
German indictment lists Hamadi's date of birth as June 13, 1964,
but he claims he was born in 1966.
   If he is tried and convicted as a juvenile, the maximum term
would be 15 years. If convicted as an adolescent, the court could
sentence Hamadi either as an adult or a juvenile, depending on how
mature it decides he was at the time of the hijacking.
   Officials say the actual testimony centering on the murder and
air piracy charges is scheduled to begin in September.
   West Germany last year refused a U.S. request to extradite the
hijacker to the United States. Government sources in Bonn told The
Associated Press that concern for the fate of two German hostages
then held in Lebanon influenced their decision.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after
a search revealed he was carrying liquid explosives.
   His older brother, Abbas Ali Hamadi, was sentenced in April by a
Duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two West
Germans in Beirut in an attempt to gain freedom for the defendant.
   One of the hostages, Alfred Schmidt, was released in September.
Businessman Rudolf Cordes is still being held in Beirut by the
pro-Iranian Holy Warriors for Freedom Shiite Moslem group.

   Lawyers for six people
sentenced to hang for the mob killing of a black official filed an
application Monday seeking to appeal a judge's refusal to reopen
the case.
   The five men and a woman, known as the Sharpeville Six, were
convicted of participating in the 1984 killing of a black town
councilor. There has been an international campaign seeking
clemency for the six, and several Western European countries have
threatened to recall their ambassadaors if the hangings take place.
   The six were granted a stay of execution March 17, one day
before they were to hang. In June, a judge extended the stay until
July 19, but rejected a bid to reopen the trial to consider
allegations that police coerced state witnesses.
   Justice Willem Human said only President P.W. Botha could
intervene to save them. Botha has rejected a clemency petition.
   On Monday, defense lawyers filed an application with the chief
justice of the Appellate Court in Bloemfontein seeking permission
to appeal Human's ruling.
   The case has generated controversy in part because the
defendants were not convicted of contributing physically to the
death of Khuzwayo Dlamini.
   They were convicted under the doctrine of common purpose, which
held them responsible because they actively participated in the mob
which killed the councilor in the black township of Sharpeville.

   A court on Monday acquitted five
members of a Spanish TV crew who were accused of espionage for
filming a U.S. Coast Guard facility that was the target of a failed
Libyan missile attack.
   The five were arrested in April 1986 while filming a navigation
station on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa.
   Earlier that month, Libya had fired two Soviet-made Scud
missiles at the island after U.S. warplanes bombed the Libyan
cities of Tripoli and Benghazi. The missiles fell harmlessly into
the sea.
   The TV crew, four men and one woman, were released hours after
their arrest. Their film was confiscated. They did not attend the
trial.
   State prosecutor Rosario Livatino had requested seven-month
prison terms for the five, but the court issued the acquittals
after just a few minutes of deliberation.

   Vice President George Bush is a distant cousin of
Queen Elizabeth II and has blood ties with every other European
royal family on or off the throne, according to the publishing
director of a blueblood directory.
   Going by precedent, that bodes well for Bush in November's
presidential election, predicted Harold Brooks-Baker, an American
who has made a name for himself analyzing royal lineages,
especially where they link up with the White House.
   ``Without any shadow of doubt, Vice President George Bush is
connected to more imperial, royal and noble houses than any
previous president,'' he said.
   ``No other American running for office in the primaries in the
Republican or Democratic Party is of European royal descent. Every
time there has been an election in the United States where a man of
royal descent was featuring, the man with royal descent won,''
Brooks-Baker said.
   On Tuesday, he released a copy of Bush's family tree traced by
his directory, Burke's Peerage, back to the 1400s.
   It found that Bush is a long-lost relative _ 13th cousin twice
removed _ of Britain's current monarch, and is a direct descendant
of King Henry VII, of one of Charles II's mistresses and of Henry
VIII's younger sister, Mary, who married King Louis XII of France.
   Charles' mistress, Barbara Villiers, who lived from 1641 to
1706, was a sixth cousin of the vice president's
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother, Elizabeth
Wellington Fay, he said.
   Miss Villiers' liaison with the king lasted 12 years, during
which she bore seven children, of whom only five were publicly
acknowleged as his.
   Bush's American roots were planted by Dr. Richard Palgrave, his
grandfather seven times removed, who crossed the Atlantic in 1630,
Brooks-Baker said.
   Bush is related to all 60 royal families on the European
Continent, including the children of Monaco's Prince Rainier and
his late American wife, Grace Kelly, in five different ways, he
said. He is also a distant cousin of the King of Albania and the
pretender to the French throne.
   Brooks-Baker said that while very few Americans are descendants
of European monarchs, ``an unbelievably high proportion of American
presidents are connected to the `Blood Royal.'''
   ``Mr. Bush is without doubt connected to more great royal
families than any reigning head of state today except His Serene
Highness Prince Franz Josef of Liechtenstein.''
   The vice president also is related to 21 of Britain's 26 dukes,
he said.
   Brooks-Baker said Burke's Peerage traced Bush's family tree
without his official approval, but a copy has been sent to him.
   ``Because Mr. Bush is so determined to be ... sort of the common
man, he shies away from this sort of thing,'' he said in an
interview.
   ``After documenting every president from George Washington,
Burke's Peerage felt that to have a possible president who was as
royal as this and who is basically related to everyone you could
imagine is too good a chance to show our genealogical strength.''
   It was Burke's Peerage who discovered that President Reagan was
a descendant of Ireland's 11th century warrior king, Brian Boru.
   Former American presidents with royal connections include
Richard Nixon, a descendant of Britain's Edward III; William Henry
Harrison and Benjamin Harrison, descended from Henry III; Ulysses
S. Grant, whose forefathers were of Byzantine nobility; and
Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt who were descended from Dutch
nobility.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, scoffing at Iranian charges
that the United States intentionally shot down a passenger jet,
said Monday the attack was ``an understandable accident'' that does
not justify withdrawing U.S. forces from the Persian Gulf. Iran
renewed its vow to retaliate.
   ``I won't minimize the tragedy,'' Reagan said.
   But as Iran continued to pull the bodies of men, women and
children from the water, the president sidestepped questions about
compensating their families. ``I've ordered an investigation and
I'm going to wait until I hear the result,'' he said.
   To that end, Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty and a team of U.S.
Navy investigators left Monday for the Middle East to probe the
downing of Iran Air Flight 655.
   Revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said in a
Tehran radio message, ``We must all be prepared for a real war and
go to the war fronts and fight against America and its lackeys.''
   ``I donate my worthless life for the sake of our victory,'' said
the 87-year-old Khomeini, who is rumored to be suffering from
terminal cancer.
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei vowed to fight ``American
aggression.''
   ``We wish to warn that the American government will have to
suffer the consequences of its recent crime in the Persian Gulf,''
Khamenei said in an interview on Tehran Radio, monitored in
Nicosia. He did not elaborate.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 168 bodies had
been recovered by Monday, including at least 38 foreigners.
   It listed them as 12 United Arab Emirates citizens, eight
Indians, eight Pakistanis, six Yugoslavs, two Kuwaitis and Italian
and an Afghan. Airline officials said the rest of the passengers
were Iranians.
   All told, Iran said 290 people perished in the attack and
declared Monday a day of mourning.
   Reagan, when asked about Iranian accusations that the U.S. Navy
intentionally shot down the passenger jet, replied: ``Well, I don't
go much by what the Iranians say _ ever.''
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition they not be further
identified, said that the commander of the Vincennes, Capt. Will C.
Rogers III, 50, had sent a message to his superiors stressing that
he had followed procedures and would make the same decisions if
faced again with the situation.
   The sources were unable to provide quotes from the
communication, which they described as classified.
   The Reagan administration, amid a rising crescendo of
questioning about the U.S. role in policing the sea lanes of the
war-torn gulf, strove to adopt a business-as-usual posture; the
White House, Pentagon and State Department were mostly quiet as the
nation observed Independence Day. Reagan had no meetings scheduled
Monday.
   Reagan proceeded with plans Monday to host friends for a Fourth
of July dinner and viewing of this city's annual fireworks display
from the South Balcony of the White House.
   Vice President George Bush and his likely Democratic rival
Michael Dukakis kept to their campaign schedules.
   And in both this country and abroad, there were increasing calls
for an end to the long Iran-Iraq war.
   Administration officials here stayed out of reporters' range,
and it could not immediately be learned whether the United States
had apologized through private channels to the government of Iran.
   Both Reagan and Bush said they regretted the plane's downing,
and several congressmen said they accepted the administration's
version that the Aegis cruiser, the USS Vincennes, had fired two
SM-2 Standard anti-aircraft missiles because it thought it was
under enemy attack.
   Reagan, dressed in casual clothes, waved and smiled as he
returned from Camp David, Md., at midday. But the president turned
grim as he stopped briefly to talk with reporters.
   ``We all know that it was a tragedy. But we're talking about an
incident in which a plane on radar was observed coming in the
direction of a ship in combat and the plane began lowering its
altitude,'' he said. ``And so I think it was an understandable
accident, to shoot and think that they were under attack from that
plane.''
   Mohammad Ja-Afar Mahallati, Iranian ambassador to the United
Nations, appearing on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program, saw it
differently. ``By definition, it was an act of terrorism that ...
should be severely punished. ... ``We will not put any limit on our
act of self-defense. We will retaliate very strongly wherever we
find American interests.''
   Asked whether he was worried about a surge in terrorism or some
other Iranian retaliatory move, Reagan said, ``You have to think
about that, knowing who they are.''
   But Reagan made clear that he had no intention of pulling U.S.
military forces out of the gulf, where the United States has taken
on the role of protecting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers.
   ``We want peace in the gulf, but we also want the right of
navigation in international waters,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union and China on Monday urged the U.S. Navy to get
out of the region, although the prevailing view of governments
around the world was that the accident dramatized the need to end
the 8-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
   Clovis Maksoud, ambassador for the League of Arab States, said
in a statement, said the downing of the plane should be a
``powerful incentive'' to end the Iran-Iraq war and that ``if the
Iranians can transcend vengeance into vision then the innocent
victims would have not died in vain.''
   He added, ``Prompt U.S. compensation would assuage the
legitimate feelings of outrage of the families in the same manner
as the speedy admission of the tragic error by the U.S.
administration mitigates speculative ruminations and hasty
antagonisms.''
   Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser during the Ford
administration, said such payments would be ``the humanitarian
thing to do.''
   On the presidential campaign front, Bush hewed to his schedule,
making a three-state foray and refusing to apologize for that.
``This is a national holiday. It is appropriate that we celebrate
it,'' he told reporters in Wyandotte, Mich.
   Bush said the captain of the USS Vincennes ``followed the rules.
... He did what he had to do.''
   ``Life goes on and our mission goes on and the world keeps
turning,'' he said.
   Dukakis renewed his call for an international effort to end the
war. He also urged Iran to reconsider its threats to respond with
terrorism to the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iranian passenger jet.
   ``As long as this senseless war between Iran and Iraq continues
... as long as we and the entire international community fail to
use our combined efforts to stop it, there will be more tragedies,
more heartaches and the ever-present risk of more accidents in the
(Persian) Gulf,'' he said in Boston.
   Jesse Jackson implored the administration to re-evaluate its
Middle East policy, but said the United States should maintain its
presence in the war-torn region.
   ``We should not move out unilaterally,'' Jackson said in
Chicago. ``The fact is they are international waters. We do have a
right to be there,'' said Jackson.
   Among members of Congress, the statements of reaction were
restrained and cautious.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, interviewed on NBC-TV's
``Today'' program, said all information about the destruction of
the jet should be released publicly ``to demonstrate that the
United States does not make war on innocents, that this was a
terrible accident, that we deeply regret it.''
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said the U.S. policy in the Persian
Gulf ``was never a very good one to begin with and this incident,
this sort of thing was very predictable.''
   ``The magnitude of this tragedy demands we take another look at
this policy,'' he said in a CBS interview.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., also interviewed on CBS, said ``the
policy of trying to protect commercial shipping in the Gulf is
absolutely right.''

   American flags were removed from a Heathrow
Airport terminal for U.S. flights on Monday and some British
lawmakers deplored the deadly U.S. missile attack on an Iranian
airliner.
   Iran demanded a stronger anti-American response.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government expressed sorrow
over the attack Sunday on the Iran Air jet that went down with
nearly 300 people aboard, but also said it understood the U.S.
Navy's reason for shooting at the plane.
   Iran's top diplomat in London, charge d'affaires Mohammed Basti,
hinted that the attack might endanger the lives of 18 Western
hostages believed held by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.
   The family of one of the British hostages, Anglican envoy Terry
Waite, appealed to Iran not to retaliate against the captives.
   In recent months, Britain and Iran have been trying to improve
their badly strained relations, raising hopes of freedom for three
Britons missing in Lebanon.
   At Heathrow Airport, police armed with submachine guns patrolled
the terminals. Baggage loaded onto American airlines came under
close scrutiny because of fears of Iranian reprisals.
   Authorities removed American flags put up in honor of the Fourth
of July in a terminal that services most U.S. flights. An airport
statement said it was ``a mark of respect'' for those who died.
   Mrs. Thatcher's government issued a statement Sunday night
saying it ``profoundly'' regretted the disaster but backed the U.S.
Navy's right to defend itself.
   Navy officials said the Airbus 300 was mistaken for an Iranian
F-14 fighter jet as it flew toward the USS Vincennes during a
U.S.-Iranian skirmish in the Persian Gulf. All aboard the plane
were presumed killed.
   Basti said he relayed Iran's ``dismay with the statement'' in a
one-hour visit Monday to the Foreign Office, and said it compared
unfavorably with the responses of other Western countries.
   Britain should ``immediately make a condemnation of this
barbaric act'' and show that British statements ``are not only
based on a special political relationship,'' Basti told reporters
outside the Foreign Office.
   Asked whether the foreign hostages, nine of them Americans, were
now in greater jeopardy, Basti replied: ``It is a natural human
reaction. ... People in the area, they have seen this thing with
their own eyes. ... Naturally they do not remain indifferent.''
   Asked earlier at a news conference how Iran would respond to the
disaster, Basti said: ``I do not disclose what kind of response,
but naturally I prefer a measured response to the magnitude of the
crime.''
   Several legislators from the governing Conservative Party and
the opposition deplored the attack.
   Conservative lawmaker Robert Adley called the Americans
``trigger-happy,'' saying: ``They are burdened with this massive
firepower but they still have not learned the lessons of the
Vietnam War.''
   Labor's Tom Clarke, who last month visited Iran with an
unofficial British delegation on a fence-mending expedition,
complained that Mrs. Thatcher ``might have distanced herself just a
bit more than she did from the American action.''
   Clarke told British Broadcasting Corp. TV that the U.S. response
``to what appears to have been a colossal mistake ... really should
have been much more apologetic than it was.''
   Waite's brother, John, urged Iran not to retaliate against the
hostages.
   ``Two wrongs do not make a right,'' he said.
   ``I think the British nation is horrified by this appalling
tragedy and I want to get (that) over to the Iranians ... so that
they don't feel isolated at least in their grief from the feelings
that all civilized people have,'' John Waite said in a BBC
interview.
   Terry Waite disappeared in Beirut in January 1987 while trying
to win the release of Western hostages.
   The longest-held of the hostages is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped in
Beirut on March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>House Speaker Says Mistakes Were Made But Iran Also Responsible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright said Monday that
while mistakes were made in the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iranian
civilian aircraft with nearly 300 people aboard, Iran bears some
responsibility for the incident.
   The leader of the Democratic-controlled House also said that the
issue warrants discussion in Congress, but that he accepted the
administration's statements that the jetliner's downing in the
Persian Gulf was a regrettable mistake.
   ``This is an awkward and uncomfortable situation for Americans
to be in,'' the Texas Democrat told reporters at a hastily arranged
news conference during a long-planned five-day trip to London.
   ``It was certainly never our intention in any instance to bring
death to the gulf,'' Wright said. ``It was a great tragedy,
obviously mistakes were made. Nobody's trying to minimize that and
I don't believe the administration seeks to minimize that.''
   However, Wright said, the ``Iranians do bear some responsibility.
   ``I think their government must realize that it places its
civilians in jeopardy when it engages in military attacks on the
sea at the very time a civilian aircraft is scheduled to fly over
the sea.''
   U.S. officials said the commander of the cruiser USS Vincennes
ordered the attack on the airliner on Sunday after the plane, which
he believed was an F-14 military jet, ignored warnings while flying
in a combat zone. All aboard are presumed dead.
   Wright, who earlier met separately with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, refused to say
whether he wanted to see congressional debate on the incident but
said he expected ``discussion on the issue. It warrants it.''
   But he said it was more important to ``close ranks,'' and
defended the U.S. commander involved, Capt. Will C. Rogers.
   ``(He) was responsible for the lives of the men on his ship,
(and) he must have been mindful of the ... Stark incident,'' when
an Iraqi plane fired on the frigate the USS Stark, killing 37 men
in May 1987.
   Washington accepted Iraq's apology and explanation that it had
mistaken the Stark for an Iranian warship.
   Asked if President Reagan's statements of regret had not been
sufficient, as some British newspapers and politicians have said,
Wright replied: ``I take his expressions of deep and sincere regret
at the loss of human lives at face value. I don't know what more
you expect him to do.''
   Wright said Mrs. Thatcher was ``very supportive and completely
understanding of our anguish'' during their 40-minute meeting.
   He and an official from Mrs. Thatcher's office, who was not
identified according to British custom, said the issue was touched
on briefly during their talks of bilateral relations, the U.S.
trade bill and other topics.
   A Foreign Office official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Howe and Wright spoke briefly on the subject of the
airliner during their 40-minute meeting. He said they talked mostly
of Northern Ireland and U.S. politics.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. and Iranian versions of the downing
of Iran Air Flight 655 differ on at least three major points,
including whether the jetliner was warned and whether it was
outside a commercial air corridor.
   The two nations also contradicted each other on whether the Navy
cruiser Vincennes knew the plane was a commercial airliner, with
the United States saying no and the Iranians saying yes.
   In addition to those points, there are a number of unanswered
questions in the wake of Sunday's missile attack on the Iranian
Airbus in the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran said killed 290 persons.
   At a news conference Sunday confirming that the United States
had shot down the plane, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Vincennes sent seven warnings to
the Airbus, three on civilian radio channels and four on military
channels. None were answered, he said.
   Mohammad Ja-Afar Mahallati, Iran's ambassador to the United
Nations, said Monday that ``we definitely reject that there has
been any warning and this case could be verified by international,
independent investigation.''
   Mahallati's comments were made on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America.''
   The U.S. contention was partially supported by the Italian navy,
which was escorting an Italian cargo ship through the strait at the
time.
   The Italian naval vessel Espero heard the Vincennes send four
radio warnings to the pilot of the Iranian plane, but there was no
response, according to a navy official in Rome.
   The Italians didn't say if the four broadcasts were the military
warnings referred to by Crowe. Nor did the Italians say if their
radios were monitoring commercial traffic.
   Crowe said the plane was hit by one missile; the Iranians say it
was struck by two.
   The plane's location and height at the time of the attack also
were subjects of disagreement.
   Crowe said the Iranian plane was four or five miles outside the
established air corridor for the heavily traveled region. That
statement was also supported by the Italian naval officials.
   But Mahallati rejected the U.S. argument. ``It was, indeed, in
the recognized corridor,'' he said.
   In addition, U.S. officials said the plane was at 9,000 feet,
but the official Islamic Republic News Agency said the airliner was
at 7,500 feet.
   The third major contradiction is whether the Navy knew what it
was shooting at. Crowe said Navy officials believed the plane was a
U.S.-made F-14 flown by Iran.
   But Mahallati said, ``It was a premeditated attack, it was a
cold-blooded murder.''
   ABC News quoted Pentagon sources Monday as saying the captain
ordered a check of civilian air schedules in the area, but that the
check was not completed at the time the plane was shot down. The
flight left nearly an hour late, the report said.
   President Reagan on Monday described the incident as ``an
understandable accident.'' Asked about Iranian claims, the
president declared, ``Well, I don't go much by what the Iranians
say _ ever.''
   Reagan, returning to the White House from the presidential
retreat at Camp David, Md., said, ``We're talking about an incident
in which a plane on radar was observed coming in the direction of a
ship in combat and the plane began lowering its altitude. And so I
think it was an understandable accident to shoot and think that
they were under attack from that plane.''
   Reagan's statement raised one of the unanswered questions, which
had been first asked Sunday after Crowe's statement that the plane
was descending toward the Vincennes.
   If the plane had just taken off from Bandar Abbas enroute to
Dubai, as Iran claimed, it likely would not have been descending at
the point where it was hit, said a Pentagon source, who declined to
be identified.
   ``I'd wait until the investigation is completed before I flatly
accepted the statement that it was descending,'' cautioned the
source, who had been stationed in the Persian Gulf.
   Another unanswered question is why the Aegis Air Defense System
aboard the Vincennes was unable to distinguish the Airbus from the
much smaller F-14 fighter jet. The Navy repeated has described
Aegis as the world's most sophisticated electronic defense system
that could differentiate among different fighters.
   Also unclear is whether the plane's transponder was working and
if not, why not.
   Transponders, used routinely on all commercial flights,
continuously broadcast identification information about a plane,
according to a spokesman for the International Civil Aviation
Organization. That information includes the name and number of the
flight, along with type of aircraft.
   Another open question is what the United States and Iran will
each do now.
   Reagan noted, ``I've ordered an investigation and I'm going to
wait until I hear the result of the investigation.''
   After the incident, Reagan said ``our sympathy and condolences
go out to the passengers, crew and their families.''
   But the United States has not yet formally apologized to Iran.
The two nations have not had formal diplomatic relations since
1980, when they were broken by the United States. Also unanswered
is whether the United States will pay reparations.
   However, NBC Nightly News reported Monday that the United States
had sent private messages to Iran repeating what it had said
publicly _ that the shooting down of the airliner was a mistake.
The network also said administration lawyers are looking into the
issue of compensation for the families of the victims.
   As for Iran, it has vowed revenge. President Ali Kahmeini said,
``we wish to warn that the American government will have to suffer
the consequences of its recent crime in the Persian Gulf.''
   Earlier, Tehran Radio said ``the criminal United States should
know that blood unlawfully shed in the disaster...will be avenged
in the same blood-spattered sky over the Persian Gulf.''

   A 67-year-old man rammed a truck loaded
with ammunition and fuel through gates at the law enforcement
complex here Monday, starting a 20-minute shootout and a major
fire, authorities said.
   Two officers were slightly injured, and the suspect was
hospitalized with gunshot wounds, authorities said.
   The fire seriously damaged the law enforcement complex, which
houses a jail, the sheriff's department and the city police
department.
   Orangeburg County Sheriff C.R. Smith said he couldn't estimate
the losses but, ``It put us out of business.'' Smith said the 140
inmates in the jail were unharmed, but had to be moved elsewhere.
   Smith said Clyde B. Myers of Branchville drove an old Ford farm
truck through the gates of the Orangeburg-Calhoun Law Enforcement
Complex about 9:15 a.m., wearing a bullet-proof vest and steel
helmet.
   Myers was shot six times _ in his right heel, right foot, right
shoulder, right hand, groin and left elbow _ before being subdued.
He also suffered thermal burns to his left hand and back. He was in
fair condition after surgery at Orangeburg-Calhoun Regional
Hospital, a spokeswoman said.
   Smith said Myers would be charged with arson and assault and
battery with intent to kill.
   Smith said he didn't know Myers' motive but recalled that he
once chained himself to a chair at a County Council meeting in 1985
in a protest against county government.
   ``As soon as he drove through the gates, he entered the back
door of the building firing a shotgun,'' Smith said. ``Our officers
returned fire.''
   Myers then went back out to his truck and got some gasoline.
Smith said the truck had two 500-gallon tanks in it, but the
sheriff was unsure how much gas was in the tanks.
   Myers poured gasoline around the gates and set it on fire,
barricading himself between the truck and a wall, the sheriff said.
   A gun battle ensued, with three state Highway Patrol troopers
who happened to be nearby helping an unspecified number of officers.
   Smith said the storage tanks on the truck ignited, and the
building eventually caught fire.
   ``After it burned a few minutes, it got too hot for him,'' Smith
said. ``He attempted to come out... When he did, he stumbled.
That's when our officers rushed him and were able to subdue him.''
   Fire trucks were then able to get to the blaze, but not before
the front office, jail offices and communications room were
virtually destroyed, Smith said. The rest of the building suffered
serious smoke damage.
   City Department of Public Safety Director Gene Brant said all
communications at the law complex were knocked out by the fire.
Phone service was restored later at an emergency operations center.
   Deputy Allen Bright was shot in the forearm and sheriff's
Detective Everette LaFrance was shot in a finger on his right hand,
Smith said. The officers, both from Orangeburg, were treated for
their injuries at a nearby hospital and released.
   Orangeburg is a city of 15,000 people 40 miles south of
Columbia. Branchville, 18 miles further south, is a town of about
1,800.

   President Reagan played host to hundreds of
White House and Secret Service personnel Monday night as the first
family joined their guests in watching the annual fireworks display
on the Washington Mall.
   ``This isn't going to be a Fourth of July speech,'' said Reagan,
standing on the south balcony of the White House with his wife
Nancy, chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein and other guests who had
joined the Reagans for dinner.
   ``Have a happy Fourth of July, and maybe when we say our
prayers, maybe we can pray that other countries will have something
to celebrate,'' the president said.
   Among the guests invited to join the Reagans on the balcony were
former CIA Director Richard Helms, syndicated columnist George Will
and Richard Davis, Mrs. Reagan's brother.
   Reagan had returned to the White House from Camp David, Md., at
midday, and had reiterated his Sunday statement that he regretted
the shooting down of an Iranian passenger jet by a U.S. Navy
cruiser in the Persian Gulf.

   The least effective thing to take to Martha
Clarke's one-hour ``Miracolo d'Amore'' is a logical mind.
   ``Miracolo d'Amore,'' with women tiptoeing around nude, men in
hunchback, white costumes of commedia dell'arte and dialogue in
Italian, doesn't lend itself to being analyzed.
   When it opened at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston,
S.C., earlier this summer, some walked out because of the nudity.
Now it's at the off-Broadway Newman Theater in the Public Theater
complex, as part of the First New York International Festival of
the Arts. At the sold-out weekend performance we attended, nobody
walked out until the end but some walked out bewildered.
   The program credits Clarke with the idea and direction, adding
``created with the (15-member) company.'' Her most recent
off-Broadway theater piece was ``The Garden of Earthly Delights,''
an acting out, with music and dance, of a Hieronymus Bosch painting.
   ``Miracolo d'Amore'' seems an acting out, in many brief scenes,
with music, of a number of paintings. Visual images, many of them
macabre, stay in the mind more than observations about love.
   Four nude women hold hands and move in a circle, like a delicate
child's game. They return to the stage, clothed, in white gowns, as
flowers. A pansy covers the bodice of one. Daisy petals cover the
head of another. One wears a bikini of camellias.
   Light, designed by Paul Gallo, comes in faint diagonal streaks,
as carefully controlled as in paintings.
   One stage wall is a building, possibly a house of assignation,
with a door and window. Couples often disappear into this door. The
opposite wall has a high window. There sits a woman with four arms
_ one assumes there's somebody behind her. At another time a woman
sits there, embracing a skeleton. The skeleton is later carried
around by other people.
   A blind soprano walks in and out and sings. A few sex acts are
portrayed. More of the time there are scenes like a man leaning
against a wall as though being crucified, a boy feeding him
spaghetti, then the man moving away from the wall, cawing, his arms
behind him like a big bird. There are bird noises, as well as wild
off-stage laughter, off and on throughout the hour.
   One dream-like scene near the end has the stage covered with
steam and the women on the floor, looking like mermaids in mist. In
another scene, the men have shotguns and kill each other.
   Remarkable minds have thought of all these theater pictures and
organized the complex comings and goings. But they haven't
communicated to everybody much about intent or meaning.

<HEAD>Ecuador Blasts United Arab Emirates for Increasing Oil Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Minister Fernando Santos blamed the
United Arab Emirates on Monday for the sharp drop in world oil
prices, saying its announcement of increased production had the
impact of ``an atomic bomb'' on the market.
   ``The drop in crude prices is the result of the lack of
discipline by one of the members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries,'' Santos said in a televised interview.
   He was referring to the Emirates' announcement it was increasing
its crude production to 1.5 million barrels a day from its OPEC-set
quota of 948,000 barrels.
   Santos said the announcement had a ``devastating effect'' on the
world oil market.
   ``The commitment to a production ceiling is based on the
understanding that all the countries must respect it. If a country
does not respect its quota, the other 12 member countries will
consider themselves free to produce as much as they consider
necessary,'' he said.
   Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates are among OPEC's 13 member
nations.
   Santos said the average price of Ecuador's oil has dropped from
$14.19 a barrel since June 1 to $12.83 a barrel on June 29.
   With an average daily production of 300,000 barrels, Ecuador is
one of the smallest producers in OPEC. But oil exports supply more
than 60 percent of the country's dollar earnings.
   The government had based this year's budget on an expected price
of $17 a barrel, Santos said.
   In Manama, Bahrain, it was reported Monday that the biggest oil
producer in the Emirates, Abu Dhabi, has posted low prices for June
retroactive crude oil sales without indicating any substantial cuts
in July.
   The reported action by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. prompted
speculation that the Emirates was unlikely to overshoot its
production quota as fixed by OPEC, at least in the short term.
   Oil industry executives said the company, in telexes sent to its
term-contract customers, set prices for its June delivery at
between $1.10 and $1.13 lower than May's retroactive levels.
   The state-owned oil refining and marketing company moved to
retroactive crude-oil pricing in March after world oil prices
substantially weakened and the company was unable to maintain
official prices decreed by OPEC.
   The sources, who cannot be identified under standing rules, said
that since there was no indication of any pricing policy change in
the telex it could mean the company meant to market sufficient
volumes of crude oil this month to substantially boost oil output
as recently threatened by Emirates officials.
   Emirates Oil Minister Mana Said al Oteiba said his country was
rightfully entitled to 1.5 million barrels a day, instead of the
OPEC quota.
   Abu Dhabi is the major oil producer among the seven emirates
federated in the United Arab Emirates, whose central government
later supported Oteiba's statements.
   But it has remained unclear whether the Emirates planned to
increase production at once or were only jockeying for position
months ahead of the December biannual meeting of OPEC, where
production levels will come up for consideration.
   Officials in Abu Dhabi oil companies, who spoke on condition
they not be identified, challenged reports that the Emirates will
increase their output in the near future in the face of the
Emirates' standing demand for a higher OPEC quota.
   ``It is the huge surplus in the market and the vast oil reserves
in Japan, the UAE's major oil importer, which determines the size
of UAE's production and not adherence to OPEC's quota,'' one
official told The Associated Press.
   Denying reports that orders were given by the Abu Dhabi
government to increase the companies' July output, the source said:
``We have not received any order to this effect. The Abu Dhabi
government realizes that it cannot market any oil quantity over its
present quota with a reasonable price.''
   The sources said Japan was pressing for discounts, both in the
United Arab Emirates as well as in other Persian Gulf oil-producing
states. Japan depends for more than 60 percent of its oil needs on
the gulf.

<HEAD>Admiral Says Commercial Planes Often Fly Into War Zones</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Airliner Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iranian commercial planes often fly into battle
areas in the Persian Gulf, putting their passengers at risk because
the aircraft are not easily identifiable by U.S. ships and
aircraft, a naval officer said.
   Rear Adm. R.G. Zeller, commander of training for the U.S.
Pacific Fleet, returned Sunday after a six-month tour in the
war-torn region, where he says civilian aircraft often fly the same
path as military planes.
   ``An Iranian F-4 (a U.S.-made Phantom fighter) would take off
from Bandar Abbas and right behind it is a commercial aircraft,''
Zeller said Sunday. ``They would both take roughly the same route
for awhile.
   ``Initially it's very difficult to distinguish between the two.
We had to be awfully careful for obvious reasons.''
   Zeller commanded the warship force that launched retaliatory
strikes against two military-manned Iranian sea platforms April 18,
four days after the U.S. destroyer Roberts was damaged seriously in
a Persian Gulf mine attack.
   The Airbus shot down Sunday departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran. It
is believed that all 290 people on board the commercial jet died in
the attack by the San Diego-based USS Vincennes.
   U.S. officials said the plane was outside civilian aviation
corridors, a claim military and aviation officials in Iran denied.
   Of the attack, Zeller said, ``Frankly, I don't know what to
think. Vincennes Capt.) Will Rogers is close personal friend and
has been for 20 years.''
   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Rogers had sufficient reasons to believe the cruiser was in
jeopardy and fired justifiably in self-defense.
   Asked if the attack on a civilian airliner would make ships
hesitant to fire on approaching planes in the future, Zeller, a
28-year Navy veteran, said: ``You know as well as I do it will.''
   The ranking officers of the USS frigate Stark were reprimanded
after 37 sailors died when the ship was hit by a missile fired from
an Iraqi warplane on May 17, 1987. U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif.,
said it was doubtful Rogers would face a similar fate.
   ``This was a tragic, tragic mistake, but one that I believe the
skipper followed proper procedures in protecting the ship and
crew,'' Lowery said.
   Rogers called a senior Navy chaplain in Coronado on Sunday night
to assure wives and family members of the crew's safety.
   ``He said all hands are safe and to please put the word out to
the families,'' said Capt. Theodore Atwood of the Pacific Fleet
Surface Force headquarters in Coronado.
   ``The wives are relieved that their husbands are safe,'' the
chaplain said. ``Now we have to look for another side of this, the
emotional side. It can have a very sobering effect.''
   Rogers, whose wife, Sharon, and son, Will Rogers IV, live in San
Diego, is not related to the late American humorist, Will Rogers,
according to the humorist's son, Will Rogers Jr.

   Police said at least 42 protesters were arrested
and three police officers hurt Monday in demonstrations following
the U.S. missile attack that downed an Iranian passenger jet and
killed all 290 people aboard.
   Eleven people were arrested outside the U.S. Consulate and
another 31 protesters were arrested after demonstrators moved
downtown.
   Police said three officers were treated at a hospital for minor
injuries.
   One person was arrested after a cup of red paint was tossed at
the consulate building and splattered a fashionable private club
next door. Protesters said they used paint because they ``didn't
have time to get real blood.''
   Demonstrators smeared themselves with paint, chanted and carried
a black coffin.
   Protests began in the morning with about 50 people in front of
the Ontario legislature.
   Demonstrators originally planned to simply march to the U.S.
Consulate, but by midafternoon, the group swelled to about 150
people as those from anti-nuclear organizations and others joined
in.
   Police said eight people were charged after they lay down in the
street, tying up morning rush-hour traffic.
   U.S. officials said the airliner was attacked Sunday in the
mistaken belief it was an Iranian warplane as it closed on U.S.
Navy ships operating near the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf
and did not respond to warnings.

   From the flutter of flags for the space shuttle Discovery to the
thunder of fireworks at dawn over a California beach, Americans
coast-to-coast celebrated the Fourth of July holiday with parades,
picnics, concerts and festivals.
   ``The mood's definitely good, because instead of moaning about
the drought, we're celebrating a lot of good things that have
happened this year,'' said Roy B. Schmidt of Brownsville, Ind.
   But the drought did leave its mark on the festivities. Many
communities across the Midwest and the Great Plains canceled
fireworks displays because of the fire danger.
   The Democratic presidential candidates joined a quarter-million
other people for fireworks and a concert in Boston, while President
Reagan was host to federal workers for the annual fireworks display
in the nation's capital.
   On Chicago's North Side, Ted Kamberos rose with the sun and
planted 1,000 plastic U.S. flags in the strip of grass along the
sidewalks in a six-block area near DePaul University.
   ``It's basically a patriotic gesture and a way for me to say
`thank you' to the neighbors,'' said Kamberos, 40, whose parents
immigrated from Greece. ``People wake up and see all the flags in a
row, it makes them feel good.''
   ``It's a big day,'' said Coung Tran, 23, a Vietnamese refugee
who was among some 300 people naturalized as U.S. citizens Monday
at Minnesota's Capital in St. Paul. ``It's a special day _
independence for the country _ and I'm glad to be part of it.''
   The celebrating started in the middle of the night at Cape
Canaveral with a flag-waving sendoff for the space shuttle
Discovery's move to its launch pad.
   ``America, the dream is still alive,'' astronaut Dave Hilmers
told a crowd of several hundred engineers, technicians and others
at Kennedy Space Center.
   In Southern California, where things are sometimes done a little
differently, early risers in Santa Monica enjoyed a spectacular
dawn display of fireworks shot over the ocean. Officials estimated
150,000 people gathered on the beach next to the Santa Monica Pier
as early as 2 a.m. for the 5 a.m. show.
   Spectators weren't the only people getting up at strange hours
for the show, started last year as a crowd control measure. The
65-member Los Angeles Pops gave a rousing performance billed as the
world's first dawn orchestral beach concert.
   In the nation's heartland, hundreds of residents of Coralville,
Iowa, lined the streets for the community's annual Fourth of July
parade and applauded a very international procession.
   Along with regular staples such as firetrucks, marching bands,
floats, clowns and politicians, citizens of the Soviet Union taking
part in the American-Soviet Peace Walk marched down the two-mile
parade route. And afterward the peace walkers met with residents at
a pot luck meal.
   About 220 Soviets and 100 Americans are traveling across the
country. They started June 17 in Washington, D.C.
   Several of the Soviets compared the holiday to their own
independence day on Nov. 7, in commemoration of the 1917
revolution. ``But I like it more here because it's more cozy.
People are lying on benches or sitting on chairs in front of their
homes,'' said Vladimir Smirnov of Moscow. ``In Moscow, people are
more well-dressed, but it's not as cozy.''
   Vice President George Bush left his summer home at
Kennebunkport, Maine, to campaign for the day in the Midwest. In a
stop at Wyandotte, Mich., a Detroit suburb, he voiced regret over
the accidental destruction of an Iranian jetliner but said the
incident would not alter U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf.
   Bush also went to the Chicago suburb of Elmwood Park, which had
a festival where Bush threw darts at balloons to win a little blue
elephant holding an American flag.
   In Boston, 250,000 people streamed to the Charles River
esplanade for the concert by the Boston Pops and the climactic
half-hour fireworks display from a barge on the river.
   They were joined by Gov. Michael Dukakis, his wife, Kitty, and
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his wife, Jackie. The Jacksons earlier
dined at the Dukakis' home.
   The prospect of sharing the evening under the stars with two
presidential aspirants was thrilling to some people _ less so to
others.
   Leo Iodice of Holliston, Mass., was asked if their presence
enhanced his holiday.
   ``Nah,'' the 35-year-old video producer said, with a shrug.
   At the Washington Mall, President Reagan played host to hundreds
of White House and Secret Service personnel Monday night as the
first family joined their guests in watching the annual fireworks
display.
   Both the Union Rescue Mission and the Fred Jordan Mission in Los
Angeles' Skid Row organized traditional Fourth of July meals
including hot dogs, baked beans, watermelon and pie to feed
thousands of homeless people.
   ``It's a day to see our inner city neighbors relax, have a good
meal and just enjoy themselves,'' said George Caywood, executive
director of the Union Mission. ``It's tough living on the streets
... Our purpose is to help lift people up, encourage them, love
them.''
   In Saratoga Springs, N.Y., 18,000 people jammed the Saratoga
Performing Arts Center to hear Carlos Santana, Miles Davis, Mel
Torme and a host of others during 12 hours of Newport Jazz, part of
the JVC Jazz Festival.
   More than 2,500 members of the Rainbow Family back-to-nature
group gathered in Zavalla, Texas, for the group's 17th annual July
Fourth celebration, where they pray for peace, love and harmony.
   In Aransas Pass, Texas, officials held the 40th annual Blessing
of the Fleet. Mayor Robert Watson said about 500 shrimping vessels
``of all shapes and sizes'' were in the harbor.
   ``The tradition of blessing the shrimp fleet is so important to
this town because that industry is vital to our well-being,'' he
said.
   Many Wisconsin communities canceled fireworks because of the
fire danger, so more than 580,000 people jammed Milwaukee's Lake
Michigan shore Sunday for a 4,000-shell display. Traffic was so
backed up that people driving into the area after 6 p.m. were
``just basically spinning their wheels,'' said police Sgt. Ken
Romels.
   In Tennessee, some cities canceled fireworks displays for fear
that a stray spark might ignite dry grass. One of the areas hit
hardest by the prolonged drought, Franklin and Murfreesboro banned
all fireworks _ including the cities' own planned public displays.
   An estimated 1.2 million people filled Chicago's Grant Park on
Sunday for that city's fireworks show over Lake Michigan.
   The Indianapolis Fire Department reported more than a 50 percent
increase in fire runs over the weekend because of grass fires
linked to firecrackers.
   Fire officials in Champaign, Ill., said fireworks caused at
least four brush fires, despite asking residents not to use
fireworks because of the drought.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Express Regret Over U.S. Attack on Iranian Jetliner</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf pvs to include comment after Dukakis-Jackson
dinner</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

   Michael Dukakis on Monday urged Iran to reconsider its threats
to avenge the U.S. shooting down of an Iranian jetliner with 290
people aboard. George Bush expressed his regrets about the tragedy,
but said the incident should not change U.S. policy in the Persian
Gulf.
   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, urged President Reagan to offer
reparations to the families of victims of the downed Iranian jet,
saying an immediate goodwill gesture was needed to save the lives
of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson later focused their attention on the
Democratic ticket, meeting for dinner at the Massachusetts
governor's Brookline home and later attending Boston's Independence
Day celebrations.
   Aides to the likely Democratic nominee described the evening as
a social gathering, but said Dukakis' search for a running mate
would likely be discussed. Asked about that afterward, Jackson
said: ``No comment.'' And Dukakis said, ``We were talking about
lots of things.''
   Jackson has said he has decided whether he would accept a vice
presidential offer, but refuses to disclose his decision. He
contends that he deserves to be offered the No. 2 spot on the
ticket.
   Dukakis has said Jackson is being considered but says he owes no
candidate an offer.
   Jackson, arriving in Boston, declined to say what the two would
talk about, other than party unity.
   ``It's a private conversation. It's a private meeting,'' he told
reporters at Logan International Airport. ``He's the host. We're
the guests.''
   At the Charlestown Navy Yard, Dukakis departed from the prepared
text of a Fourth of July speech to appeal to Iran not to try to
seek revenge through terrorism. He renewed his call for an
international effort to end the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   ``While we all deeply regret the tragedy, this is no time for
acts of terror or revenge in response to the incident,'' Dukakis
said at the berth of the USS Constitution. ``So I urge the
government of Iran to reconsider its threats and to join us and the
entire international community to ending a war that already has
taken the lives of more than one million people.''
   Mohammad Ja-Afar Mahallati, Iranian ambassador to the United
Nations, said the downing of the Iran Air Airbus was premeditated
and he called it ``cold-blooded murder.''
   ``By definition, it was an act of terrorism that ... should be
severely punished,'' he said.
   The USS Vincennes shot down the commercial jetliner on Sunday
while engaged in battle with Iranian gunboats. The Pentagon said
the Vincennes crew believed the wide-bodied Airbus was a smaller
F-14 fighter about to attack the ship.
   ``Clearly, we have the right to defend our forces against
imminent threat, and apparently the shooting down of the airliner
occurred over what appears to have been an unprovoked attack
against our forces,'' Dukakis said.
   Vice President Bush, campaigning in the Midwest, spoke out for
the first time on the incident, expressing deep regret.
   ``Obviously, as we celebrate our great national holiday our
hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were lost
and also (hearts) go out to those kids, those young Americans who
are defending freedom halfway around the world,'' he said.
   The all-but-certain Republican nominee said he believed U.S.
policy in the gulf will remain the same. ``Life goes on, our
mission goes on and the world keeps turning,'' Bush said.
   The vice president continued his campaign schedule, saying
``there is nothing I can be doing about this matter in Washington
D.C.''
   However, Bush planned to attend a White House briefing on the
gulf incident on Tuesday, according to aides.
   Prior to leaving Chicago for his meeting with Dukakis, Jackson
said the shooting incident complicates the situation in the gulf
region at a time when there were indications that forces in Iran
favoring negotiations were gaining strength.
   ``I am sincerely concerned that we make a gesture of goodwill
immediately so as to protect the lives of Americans who are in the
region, specifically the Americans who are held hostage there,'' he
said.
   Jackson urged Reagan to go on television to express ``genuine
regrets'' about the plane's downing and ``offer reparations to the
families to ease some of the pain.'' The president has already said
he deeply regrets the loss of life.
   Jackson also called on the Reagan administration to re-evaluate
its Middle East policy but said the United States should maintain a
presence in the war-torn gulf.
   ``We should not move out unilaterally. The fact is they are
international waters. We do have a right to be there,'' Jackson
said.

   On a lighter note, a blueblood directory in London said Bush is
a distant cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and has blood ties with
every other European royal family on or off the throne.
   The directory, Burke's Peerage, found that Bush is a 13th cousin
twice removed of Britain's current monarch, and is a direct
descendant of King Henry VII, of one of Charles II's mistresses and
of Henry VIII's younger sister, Mary, who married King Louis XII of
France.
   ``Mr. Bush is without doubt connected to more great royal
families than any reigning head of state today except His Serene
Highness Franz Josef of Liechtenstein,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker,
director of Burke's Peerage.

   Fire swept through a duplex Monday, killing
five members of one family, fire officials said.
   Jack Blose, 35; his wife, Deborah, 31; their 12-year-old son
Jack Jr., and 5-year-old daughter, Rachel, were killed in the
blaze, the Stark County coroner's office said.
   Another daughter, Lacey, 4, died later at Akron Children's
Hospital, a spokeswoman there said.
   The causes of death had not been determined, pending a coroner's
report.
   The family rented one side of the duplex and the other side was
vacant, said Gary Kimble, an assistant chief for the Canton Fire
Department.
   The fire, which began on the front porch of the duplex, was
reported about 2:15 a.m., Kimble said. The fire caused about
$47,000 damage, he said.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, Kimble said.

   An international airline group urged governments
Monday to cooperate with an inquiry into the U.S. downing of an
Iranian jetliner, and at least two airlines announced route changes
to avoid the area of the incident.
   The International Air Transport Association said the
Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization would
conduct a ``full and objective'' investigation into the shooting
down of the Iran Air Airbus 300 by a U.S. Navy ship in the Persian
Gulf on Sunday.
   The airline association deplored ``the use of force against a
civil aircraft and strongly urges all governments to take the
necessary steps to prevent recurrence of such incidents.''
   The International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency,
said later Monday that Ali Akbar Golruni, Iran's representative to
the organization, filed a formal request for an emergency meeting
of the agency's council to set up an inquiry into the crash.
   But organization president Assad Kotaite said his agency needs
more information, particularly from the United States, before
granting the request.
   ``We have not received ... preliminary reports regarding the
circumstances from the parties involved, except from Iran,''
Kotaite said.
   In Tokyo, Japan Air Lines said its twice-weekly flight from
Tokyo to Athens, Greece, would alter its route over the gulf to
avoid the area where the shooting took place.
   The airline said it will begin flying over Abu Dhabi in the
United Arab Emirates instead of over Dubai, also in the same
country but closer to Iran and the Strait of Hormuz. The Iran Air
plane was flying to Dubai from Iran.
   In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways said the daily Hong Kong to
London flight also would alter its route over the gulf. Spokeswoman
Rebecca Chan said Hong Kong carrier's planes do not fly over the
area where the Iranian jet was shot down, but the slight route
change to the south will take aircraft even further from the spot.
   A JAL official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a JAL
DC-10 with 156 passengers and 16 crew members left Tokyo for Athens
on Monday using the new route.
   Officials from both companies said the route change will add
about five minutes to the trip.
   The United States said its forces mistook the wide-bodied Iran
Air plane for a F-14 fighter and shot it down when it failed to
heed seven warnings.
   President Reagan said the United States would conduct a full
investigation. Iranian officials have demanded the United Nations
or another independent world body investigate the incident.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis renewed his call Monday
for an international effort to end the Iran-Iraq war and urged Iran
to reconsider its threats to respond with terrorism to the U.S.
Navy's downing of an Iranian passenger jet.
   ``As long as this senseless war between Iran and Iraq continues
... as long as we and the entire international community fail to
use our combined efforts to stop it, there will be more tragedies,
more heartaches and the ever-present risk of more accidents in the
(Persian) Gulf,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democratic presidential nominee-to-be hosted rival Jesse
Jackson for dinner at his Brookline, Mass., home before the two
candidates and their wives attended the traditional Fourth of July
Boston Pops concert alongside the Charles River.
   Aides billed the evening as a social gathering but said Dukakis'
search for a running mate was likely to come up in discussion.
Jackson skirted questions about likely dinner-table conversation on
his arrival at Boston's Logan Airport.
   ``It's a private meeting. He's the host and we are the guests,''
he told reporters.
   Arriving at Dukakis' home, where he was greeted by a crowd of
about 200 onlookers, Jackson was asked if the subject of a running
mate would be discussed.
   ``Dinner, dinner, dinner,'' he replied.
   The Massachusetts governor has said Jackson is being considered
for the No. 2 spot on the ticket, but it is viewed as highly
unlikely that Dukakis would offer it to him.
   After the dinner, Dukakis emerged and told reporters, ``We were
talking about lots of things.''
   Jackson said then he had no comment. Later, arriving at his
Boston hotel, he told reporters: ``Our conversation is private, and
should remain private.''
   At a morning appearance at the USS Constitution, the Navy's
oldest commissioned warship, Dukakis departed from the text of his
speech Monday to demand an end to the nearly 8-year-old gulf war.
   ``I believe that the United States must take the lead ... to
stop this war permanently,'' Dukakis said.
   ``And while we all deeply regret the tragedy, this is no time
for acts of terror or revenge in response to the incident. So I
urge the government of Iran to reconsider its threats and to join
us and the entire international community in ending a war that
already has taken the lives of more than one million people,'' he
said.
   The USS Vincennes downed the Iran Air Airbus Sunday during
fighting with Iranian gunboats, presumably killing all 290 people
aboard the commercial jet. The Pentagon reported that the Vincennes
crew believed the wide-bodied Airbus was an F-14 fighter about to
attack the ship.
   Iran vowed to avenge the ``premeditated, cold-blooded murder''
and Iranian President Ali Khamenei said Monday that Iran is ``ready
to fight ... American aggression.''
   Dukakis said the United States clearly has the right ``to defend
our forces against imminent threats, and apparently the shooting
down of the airliner occurred over what appears to have been an
unprovoked attack against our forces.''
   Dukakis' speech to a small gathering at the Charlestown Navy
Yard was a variation on his standard stump talk, peppered with
references to his immigrant past, central campaign theme of
economic opportunity and attacks on the Reagan administration.
   ``Respect for the Constitution and for the rule of law is the
most basic, the most conservative, the most important principle of
our democratic society,'' Dukakis said. ``And it must begin at the
top _ in the White House, in the Defense Department, and in the
office of the attorney general of the United States.''
   He also paid tribute to the colonists who fought the
Revolutionary War for American independence.
   ``Ours was not just a revolution against one government,''
Dukakis said in his holiday speech. ``It was a revolution of the
human spirit. And it lives wherever men and women are taking into
their own hands the responsibility to build a better world.''
   The Dukakis campaign said the menu for the dinner with Jackson
was standard New England fare: homemade clam chowder, fish and
vegetables, and chocolate cake for dessert.

   The nation's largest teachers union endorsed
overwhelmingly Monday a proposal that each state name name at least
one school district a ``learning laboratory'' where teachers could
experiment and take the lead in improving schools.
   ``Hot dog! You did it!'' said Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of
the National Education Association, after the delegates gathered
for their annual convention passed her pet proposal by voice vote.
   Futrell called the idea ``our most ambitious reform effort to
date.''
   In a 45-minute keynote address before 8,227 delegates gathered
for the NEA's annual convention, Futrell had urged teachers to
establish ``a national network of innovative school districts.''
   Such districts, she said, might do away with academic tracking,
finance schools by means other than property taxes, experiment with
more flexible scheduling, or anything else it wanted to try in the
name of reform.
   In San Francisco, 3,000 teachers gathered for the rival American
Federation of Teachers annual convention adopted a similar program
of school experimentation. The AFT plan called for establishment of
thousands of ``schools within schools'' where groups of six or more
teachers could try innovative educational ideas free of
bureaucratic meddling.
   AFT delegates heard Monday from Pulitzer Prize-winning
sociologist Paul Starr, who warned that education vouchers that
would allow parents to choose between public or private schools at
taxpayer expense are ``a recipe for inflation'' that would destroy
public education.
   ``In many ways, the educational voucher proposals resemble third
party payments in health care ... Vouchers would encourage private
schools in part to keep themselves exclusive,'' he said. ``Third
party payment is a recipe for inflation in any sector. To introduce
it into education would be fiscally reckless.''
   Starr, an authority on the economics of medical care, said
vouchers were ``an illusory tonic that would make the whole
educational system ... far more stratified'' and ethnically
fragmented.
   Teachers generally applauded the NEA ``learning laboratories''
initiative but some expressed mixed feelings.
   ``I'm a little afraid that it may be just another experiment. It
could be limited to districts that are already innovating,'' said
Kathleen Conklin, who teaches English at Malcolm X Shabazz High
School in Madison, Wis.
   Chester Finn, assistant U.S. Secretary of Education for research
and improvement, called the AFT and NEA reform programs ``10
percent good, 90 percent bad.''
   ``That they are willing to admit that things aren't hunky-dory
in schools, that much is good,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``But the bad part is that they seem to suggest that we need to
have a vast experiment, as if we didn't know or have the faintest
idea of what works in schools.''
   ``The reason these things don't happen is because the teacher
unions won't let them happen,'' he said.
   Both Futrell and AFT president Albert Shanker have said
repeatedly that the real enemies of reform are the Reagan
administration which has failed to support schools with leadership
and funds, and states which have mandated educational change from
on high without teacher input.
   Presidential politics was the second major theme in Futrell's
address. Last week, the NEA board backed Michael Dukakis for the
Democratic nomination, and Futrell heaped praise on him as someone
who ``understands and embodies the link between education and the
American dream.''
   The nation needs ``a president who will give us a fair deal
instead of an arms deal, a drug deal, or an insider deal,'' she
said, ``a president who will invest more to make every American
child a star than he will to fill God's heaven with star wars.''
   Neither teacher union plans to make a final presidential
endorsement until after the major party conventions this summer.
   The AFT delegates Monday night re-elected Shanker, 59, who was
unopposed for his eighth two-year term as president of the
677,000-member union. The delegates also re-elected longtime AFT
secretary-treasurer Robert G. Porter and filled 38 vice presidents'
posts, including four new ones.

   Two children whose burned bodies were
found near a dump were killed by their mother and another woman,
authorities charged Monday.
   Barbara McCoy, 40, the mother of the two children, and Mary
Delois Williams, 32, were in jail without bond Monday pending a
hearing Wednesday morning, Crittenden County Sheriff's investigator
Charles Walker said.
   Ms. McCoy, who is unemployed, and Ms. Williams, a teacher's
assistant, were arrested Monday at the Motel 6 in West Memphis,
where the two had apparently been staying for several days,
investigators said. Both were charged with first-degree murder.
   Walker and investigator R.D. Clay said authorities were alerted
by a man who found the bodies of Bianca Tirado, 7, and Maximillion
E. McCoy, 2, in plastic garbage bags just off a gravel road leading
to a dump between West Memphis and the Mississippi River.
   The children had been burned over 75 percent of their bodies,
Walker and Clay said.
   Walker said he suspects that the bodies were dumped Saturday
night or early Sunday morning.
   The children were slain elsewhere and dumped and set afire, Clay
said.
   Walker said an autopsy would probably be performed Tuesday
morning.

<HEAD>Barges Backing Up As Corps Dredges Mississippi River Channel</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Drought-Main Street, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lower Mississippi River towboat traffic halted Monday as U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers dredges worked to finish deepening the
channel near Greenville, Miss., and Memphis, Tenn.
   The channel was closed Monday night at Tamm Bend, north of
Memphis, after operators of the dredge Burgess became worried that
a barge would run into them, Coast Guard spokesman Dave Schuster
said.
   The Burgess began digging Sunday and may be finished in time to
reopen the channel by Tuesday morning, Schuster said.
   Once the Greenville work is finished, officials plan to move the
dredge there to another location.
   ``Traffic is stopped while we've got the dredge in there,''
Louis Logue of the corps' Vicksburg, Miss., office said Monday
night.
   About 20 southbound and 20 northbound towboats were waiting near
the Greenville-Arkansas bridge as the dredge Jadwin worked to cut a
15-foot-deep channel in an area where the depth had dropped to
seven feet, he said.
   Dredging near Greenville, which began Sunday afternoon, was to
be completed by early Tuesday morning, Logue said, and the Jadwin
would move either to an area 30 miles south of Greenville or 30
miles south of Natchez, Miss.
   The river near Greenville was dredged two weeks ago after the
channel became too shallow for barge traffic, keeping as many as
1,800 barges waiting for the waterway to reopen.
   Logue said a decision on where to move the Jadwin would be made
after an inspection of the river below Greenville.
   Another dredge was being used to clear the channel near Natchez,
Logue said, but it would take up to five days to clear the area.

   About 5,000 protesters demanding the
removal of American military bases hurled crude bombs at police
Monday near the U.S. Embassy, wounding at least six people,
authorities said.
   A second large anti-U.S. protest outside Clark Air Base ended
peacefully.
   Also Monday, President Corazon Aquino said she ordered immediate
solutions to a string of unresolved political murders in the
capital.
   Violence erupted outside the seaside U.S. Embassy near the end
of the three-hour protest as some demonstrators hurled rocks and
sticks at outnumbered riot police.
   Then two homemade bombs exploded, showering police with shrapnel
but causing only minor injuries. Five policemen and a female
bystander received burns and small cuts.
   ``We thought it was all over,'' police Lt. Col. Robert Barbers
told reporters. ``There was no warning. We just heard two loud
explosions and they started throwing stones at us.''
   Barbers said at least three homemade bombs spiked with one-inch
nails were thrown at the police lines, but one did not explode.
   The demonstrators included students, peasants, factory workers,
teachers and at least one member of the House of Representatives,
Bonifacio Gillego.
   Protest leaders cut their fingers with razor blades and signed a
``manifesto of eviction'' in blood, telling the U.S. government to
dismantle the bases by 1991, when their current lease expires.
   An American official received the document through the embassy's
reinforced steel gates.
   ``Come 1991, we are going to remove the bases if the Americans
do not remove them voluntarily,'' Gillego said in a speech an hour
before the violence.
   ``There is nothing more evil in the face of this planet than
U.S. imperialism,'' labor leader Crispin Beltran told the crowd.
``There is no need to negotiate with them.''
   In Angeles City, about 50 miles north of Manila, approximately
3,000 leftist protesters rallied outside the gates of the U.S.-run
Clark Air Base.
   About 200 Filipino troops guarded Clark's main gate, standing
behind barbed wire barricades while a helicopter gunship hovered
overhead, but the four-hour rally ended peacefully. The
demonstrators burned effigies of a missile draped with an American
flag.
   Both rallies were demanding the closure of Clark, Subic Bay
Naval Base and four smaller installations the United States
maintains in the Philippines.
   Mrs. Aquino meanwhile said after meeting with the Philippine
Constabulary chief, Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, that she had demanded
action on the unsolved murders. The Constabulary is the country's
internal security force charged with maintaining law and order
nationwide.
   ``I told him that we really have to come up with a speedy
solution of these cases. Otherwise, people will lose confidence in
us,'' the president told reporters. She said she arranged a meeting
with National Bureau of Investigation officials.
   At least 130 politically motivated murders have been committed
in the capital since Mrs. Aquino came to power in 1986. Most remain
unsolved.
   Human rights groups have blamed the murders of leftist
personalities on rightist death squads, while the killings of
policemen, soldiers, suspected civilian informers and government
officials have been attributed by military and police authorities
to urban-based communist guerrillas.

   Long before their forces shot down an
Iranian civilian jet over the Persian Gulf, U.S. Navy officers said
their constant fear was making a mistake in a war zone bustling
with civilian activity.
   Iran said all 290 people aboard the Iran Air jet were killed
Sunday when the U.S. guided missile cruiser Vincennes fired at it
during a routine flight from Iran to Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates.
   While not officially at war, U.S. sailors are in a combat
environment where ships remain at a high state of alert for weeks
on end and weapons are tested every few days.
   ``There are many threats out here, and maybe the worst one is
the possibility of somebody making a mistake,'' one ship's
commander said. ``In a confined area like the gulf, and with the
weapons on hand, the potential for disaster is incredible.''

   Secretary of State George Shultz crosses the
Pacific this week to visit nine capitals and hold major policy
talks including discussion of security at the Seoul Olympics.
   Shultz also is likely to be dogged by questions about Sunday's
U.S. missile attack on an unarmed Iranian passenger jet, which
immediately provoked comparisons to the Soviet downing of Korean
Air Lines flight 007 in 1983.
   Already on Shultz' agenda, before Sunday's incident, were issues
including the Olympics, Cambodia's future, American military bases
in the Philippines, Chinese missile exports, U.S. trade deficits
with newly prosperous Pacific nations, ``boat people'' refugees
from Vietnam and other problems lingering from the Indochina War.

   The head of America's largest teacher union
is proposing that each state make at least one school district a
``learning laboratory'' where educators and others could freely
experiment with school reform.
   Such districts would have broad freedom to ``redefine not only
what we teach, but how we teach America's children,'' National
Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell said in a
speech scheduled for delivery at today's opening of the 1.9
million-member group's annual convention.

   Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson criticized U.S.
policy in the Persian Gulf after the Navy mistakenly shot down an
Iranian passenger jet, saying ``it is not enough just to be
sorry.'' Nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis, however, said ``our armed
forces have a right to defend themselves.''
   Republican George Bush, who was spending today making
appearances at Fourth of July celebrations around the Midwest,
would not comment Sunday on the destruction of the Iran Air plane
over the Strait of Hormuz.
   The Iranians said 290 people were aboard the Airbus, and all
were presumed dead. The Pentagon said the U.S. vessel that shot
down the jetliner believed it was under attack by a fighter plane.
   Bush's press secretary Sheila Tate said the vice president, who
spent the weekend at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, was
``briefed throughout the day'' on the incident but had no public
comment Sunday.
   Dukakis said in a statement from his home in Brookline, Mass.,
that he was ``saddened by the loss of life,'' but added: ``Plainly,
our armed forces have a right to defend themselves when attacked.''

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Monday, while stock prices fell slightly.
   The dollar finished at 134.85 yen, up 0.35 yen from last
Friday's close. It started the week at 135.15 yen and ranged
between 134.60 yen and 135.20 yen during the day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the market's
main barometer, fell 2.13 points, or 0.077 percnt, to close at
27,360.39 points.
   ``The dollar was bought in early trading because of the Middle
East situation,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial
bank in Tokyo. The U.S. Navy shot down an Iranian jetliner over the
Persian Gulf Sunday.
   But the dollar eased off mainly on profit-taking and
anticipation of the Fourth of July holiday in the United States,
and also partly because of market caution about possible Bank of
Japan intervention, another dealer said.
   Traders said the central bank did not intervene on behalf of the
yen, but news reports over the weekend said the bank has plans to
stem the dollar's climb if the currency's rise quickens.
   On the stock exchange, ``the trend continues from Saturday,''
said one trader. He said the market is likely continue on its
present course as long as the dollar and interest rates continue on
theirs.
   ``You're not going to get any real buying until you see
stability in currency and bond markets,'' he said.
   ``The problem with that is that the longer they wait, the more
difficult it becomes,'' he said. ``The foreign exchange market has
built up considerable momentum.''

   Lumber dealer Frank Miller's sales one day
totaled a box of nails. The John Deere dealer in Steele isn't
selling anything bigger than lawnmowers. A farm supply store in
Wilton is giving employees an extra day off each week.
   Everywhere on Main Street North Dakota, businessmen and bankers
are crossing their fingers as they watch the skies for an end to
the lingering drought that analysts estimate could cost the state's
economy as much as $3 billion this year.
   ``I've never seen anything like it before,'' said Miller, the
83-year-old owner of Wing Lumber, who says most of his patrons
these days are just looking for a good conversation.
   Business at the Cenex farm supply dealership in Wilton, 24 miles
to the east, is off a third, said manager Ken Vetter. He's making
ends meet selling air conditioners _ the hottest item of this
searing summer.
   With crops wilting and cattle going to market, farmers aren't
coming in for the fertilizer and pesticides they normally need in
the spring and early summer. Baling twine is plentiful; with hay
hard to come by, farmers are buying a fraction of the twine they
usually do, Vetter said.
   ``I don't know how slow it's going to get,'' he said.
   Economists and crop specialists at North Dakota State University
estimated last week that the drought had destroyed $530 million
worth of wheat and other grains and had cost livestock producers
$225 million.
   In addition, North Dakota farmers could lose as much as $473
million this year in government crop payments because of soaring
commodity prices, the researchers said.
   The price support payment for wheat, which was $1.53 a bushel
before the drought, would drop to an estimated 38 cents.
   Even with crop insurance and the sale of stockpiled grain,
farmers would lose an estimated $867 million in income this year.
   Experts hold out hopes of good yields from row crops such as
beans and sugar beets in eastern North Dakota, where the drought is
less severe. But grain crops have been destroyed in parts of
western and north-central North Dakota and damaged seriously
elsewhere.
   Without significant government help, those losses would ripple
through a state economy that has been crippled since the early
1980s by low crop and oil prices.
   ``In the long run, it's a people problem,'' said Arlen Leholm,
an economist at North Dakota State University. ``We're going to be
translating these sort of losses in our agriculturally dependent
areas into a lot of human suffering.''
   Nowhere will the impact of the drought be felt more keenly than
on the Main Streets of the state's small towns, where merchants
depend almost exclusively on farm business.
   They already were struggling to survive because of the state's
tight economy and the increasing trend by farm families to shop in
the state's bigger cities.
   Wilton, population 950, has lost a drug store and hardware store
in recent years. Little is left in Wing for its 200 residents
except for the Cenex dealership and a general store, bar and cafe.
   ``Any business that does business with farmers is going to see
reduced profits,'' said Wilbur McGinnis, president of First State
Bank of Wilton.
   The drought ``is going to have a real hard effect on Main
Street,'' said Joseph Lamb, president of the state-owned Bank of
North Dakota.
   ``No matter what the farm subsidies are ... obviously (farmers)
are not going to have that extra money to buy items that are sold
on Main Street.''
   What could save Main Street this fall and winter is a
combination of rain, government help, high grain prices _ and the
tenacity that has kept them going through lean economic times
before.
   ``No question it will be tough on the small businesses, but
there are a lot of them out there who are survivors,'' said
McGinnis.
   ``They've learned to survive no matter what. We're hoping
they'll get through this period.''
   Many farmers could make up for some of the crop income they will
lose this year by selling grain they have in storage. Even if they
have to pay off government loans to secure the grain, they could
make a profit.
   In the meantime, the Reagan administration is being pressed to
plow savings from the government's price support programs back to
farmers to make up for crop losses.
   If farmers who lost their crops get the government deficiency
payments they expected before the drought, the state would gain
$400 million, officials say.
   While the wheels of government turn, Main Street waits to see
what the rest of the summer and fall will bring, but optimism
remains even as the drought hangs on.
   Implement dealers make do repairing tractors instead of selling
new ones. Vetter's Cenex dealership puts employees to work
installing the central air conditioning systems for which it has a
waiting list of five customers.
   Miller keeps opening up his lumberyard each day as he has for
the past 20 years.
   ``It's just tough and it's going to be that way for a while,''
he said.

   Home equity loans, enjoying a boom in
popularity because of changes in the tax law, now account for more
than $75 billion of total consumer debt, a government study has
found.
   The Federal Reserve, conducting its first comprehensive look at
the new consumer credit lines, found that some 3 million homeowners
have home equity loans and that three-fourths of all existing loans
were taken out in the past two years.
   The home equity loans are replacing second mortgages in
popularity because they offer greater flexibility to consumers.
   While second mortgages are extended for a specified period of
time and require repayment of principal and interest in equal
monthly installments, home equity accounts are on-going
arrangements that allow the borrower flexibility in the size and
timing of drawdowns and payments.
   Banks have aggressively promoted the new home equity loans
through extensive advertising campaigns and attractive interest
rates that have been significantly lower than on other types of
consumer credit, the study said.
   The Fed survey found that the average interest charged on a home
equity loan in 1987 was 10.2 percent. That compared to an average
of 17.9 percent interest on credit card debt, 14.2 percent for a
24-month personal loan and 10.5 percent average interest on a
48-month new car loan.
   ``The relatively attractive finance rates on home equity
accounts have created an incentive for consumers to use them both
for new borrowing and to repay debts carrying higher interest
rates,'' the study said.
   In fact, the Fed found that the most prevalent use of the home
equity loans, reported by 53 percent of all borrowers surveyed, was
to pay off other debt, mainly credit card debt or auto loans.
   The second largest use for the loans, reported by 25 percent of
borrowers, was to raise cash for home improvement projects.
   The biggest boost for home equity loans came from the Tax Reform
Act of 1986, the massive overhaul of the tax system which lowered
tax rates by eliminating a variety of deductions. While phasing out
deductions on most consumer credit, the law allowed continued
deductions for loans secured by real estate.
   The Fed report said that many lenders have prominently featured
the tax advanges of home equity loans in their advertising. Large
banks have been spending more of their advertising budget on home
equity loans than on any other loan product, the report said.
   Consumer groups have charged that many banks have engaged in
deceptive practices by advertising super-low rates while failing to
explain that those introductutory rates will be in effect for only
a short time. Banks have also been attacked for failing to disclose
to consumers important information about the terms and conditions
of the loans and the fees charged in connection with taking out the
loan.
   The Fed survey did not specifically address these problems, but
it did provide these details on common characteristics of home
equity loans:
   _ The interest rate on the loans is a variable rate which is
determined by adding a fixed margin to a specified rate.
Three-fourths of banks use the prime rate, now 9 percent at major
U.S. banks. The average margin is 1.8 percentage points. That would
mean the average home equity loan now has an interest rate of 10.8
percent. The survey found that some banks weren't asking for
anything above the prime rate while at the other extreme some banks
were charging 4 percentage points above the prime.
   _ Competition among lenders has prompted many of them to absorb
some or all of the fees for opening home equity loans. These
charges include loan origination fees and closing costs for such
items as a title search, property appraisal, credit report and
title insurance. In 1987, 8 percent of large banks and savings and
loans charged no fees and 68 percent waived some fees.
   _ Most lenders limit the maximum line of credit to between 70
percent and 80 percent of the homeowner's equity, defined as the
appraised value of the home less all mortgage indebtedness. Within
those boundaries, banks usually established a minimum amount for a
home equity credit line of $5,000 and a maximum of $100,000.
   _ Most lenders, a total of 90 percent, allowed customers to draw
down the credit line by check. Smaller percentages of lenders
allowed access to the credit line by telephone, automatic teller
machines and credit cards. The average minimum for each drawdown
was $300.

   Organizations of consumers and fire chiefs have
asked the federal government to act on what they call an imminent
fire hazard in 210,000 Ford vans and ambulances caused by
inadequate repairs.
   The Center for Auto Safety and the International Association of
Fire Chiefs released statements Sunday saying the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration has neglected the problems. They sent
separate letters Friday to Transportation Secretary James Burnley.
   Last year, in response to reports of fuel-system problems that
caused fires, Ford recalled 193,000 1983-87 E-250 and E-350 model
Econoline vans and 16,000 1983-87 ambulances built on the E-350
Econoline chassis.
   Ford spokesman Chuck Snearly said the automaker believes the
modifications performed under the recalls ``are doing the job they
were intended to do and we are making every effort to complete
these recalls as quickly as possible.''
   But the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based group often
at odds with the auto industry and its regulators, petitioned NHTSA
on May 10 to order a new recall of the ambulances because of
improperly installed hoses that may have caused coolant to leak and
set fire to engines.
   ``We have concerns that the NHTSA has not responded to our May
10 defect petition, and at the same time, fires on Ford ambulances
are occurring better than one per week across the country,'' CAS
spokesman Robert Dewey said from Washington, D.C.
   Fewer than 10 percent of the Ford vans were repaired within
seven months of the initial recall, and 21 Ford ambulances,
including three that were repaired under the recall, have caught
fire since March 24, Dewey said.
   Warren E. Isman, president of the fire chiefs' group, criticized
the ``lack of assertive action'' by NHTSA.
   ``Since fire and emergency services provide over 60 percent of
the pre-hospital emergency medical care in this country, we are in
double jeopardy because we also respond to the vehicle fires,''
Isman said in the letter to Brimley.
   ``It is difficult to fully protect the public when emergency
response personnel themselves are not safe,'' Isman said.
   On June 24, the American Ambulance Association, a
Washington-based organization representing private ambulance
operators, told NHTSA Ford may have done an inadequate job of
repairing the ambulances and called for a federal investigation.
   Clarence Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety said earlier
recalls to fix problems were ``two little, too late.''
   ``Ford ambulances and vans continue to catch fire and burn
because the recall repairs are inadequate or not done at all,''
Ditlow said in a statement. ``While Americans burn in Ford fires,
the NHTSA has done little.''

<HEAD>French-Belgian Group Boost Stake In Societe Generale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French investment group and a Belgian
insurer said Monday they have gained control of about 80 percent of
Societe Generale de Belgique SA, the subject of a protracted
takeover battle.
   Under an accord reached two weeks ago with Italian financier
Carlo De Benedetti, who initiated the battle, Cie. Financiere de
Suez and Groupe AG, the insurance concern, are now at the helm of
Belgium's largest holding company.
   Adhering to terms of the agreement, De Benedetti has reduced his
Societe Generale holdings and abandoned his takeover bid that was
the cornerstone of his plan to create a pan-European holding
company.
   De Benedetti's group, however, will continue to hold a 16
percent of Societe Generale's outstanding shares. In return for
terminating his offer, De Benedetti was to receive an undisclosed
cash payment and was to be made one of three Societe Generale vice
presidents.
   Suez and Groupe AG said in a statement that Erasmus Capital, a
unit created in April by the French-Belgian alliance, will serve as
a holding company that will control most of the Societe Generale
shares.
   The statement also said some Societe Generale shares could be
reintroduced ``in the near future'' for trading on the local stock
exchange.
   Only a fraction of Societe Generale shares remained in public
hands as a result of the five-month struggle between De Benedetti
and his rivals.
   De Benedetti amassed a stake of about 45 percent before the
recent agreement, while the alliance, led by Suez and AG, held a
slight majority.
   The statement also said the ``centers of decision'' for Societe
Generale will be maintained in Belgium, an apparent attempt to ease
fears that the company might fall into foreign hands.

   The U.S. dollar jumped on Monday on news that the
U.S. Navy shot down an Iranian passenger jet with 290 people on
board.
   But gold, after a brief spurt, ended little changed in dull
European trading.
   The dollar's upward trend against all the major currencies
followed a sharp rise on Asian markets, where the business day ends
before Europe's begins.
   The dollar often rises during periods of international tensions
because it is regarded as a safe haven for investment.
   The Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, continued to
intervene in foreign exchange markets to halt the dollar's climb,
but traders said it had little effect.
   ``The Bundesbank was selling dollars, but with markets in the
U.S. closed for a holiday, there weren't any real trends, and sheer
momentum carried the dollar up,'' said one trader in Frankfurt.
   Dealers in London cautioned that Monday was a ``false market,''
because American banks and businesses were closed for the Fourth of
July holiday.
   In Tokyo the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 134.85 after
profit-taking. Later, in London, it was quoted at 135.40 yen.
   The British pound continued to fall in London, despite the Bank
of England's decision to signal a half-point increase in the the
British commercial banks' base lending rate to 10 percent, its
second hike in less than a week. One pound cost $1.6825 Monday,
cheaper than late Friday's $1.7023.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.8295 West German marks, up from 1.8213; 1.5233 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5130; 6.1595 French francs, up from 6.1375; 2.0575 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0530; 1,353.25 Italian lire, up from 1,352.50,
and 1.2215 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2190.
   The absence of U.S. traders on Monday kept European gold trading
limited, dealers in Zurich said, although the downing of the
Iranian jetliner initially boosted the price of gold. But lack of
follow-through buying in Europe pressured the metal back downward,
they said.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $437.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $437. In Zurich, the bid price was
$437.50, unchanged from late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.24 to close at a bid $439.64.
   Silver was quoted in London late Monday at a bid price of $6.73
a troy ounce, down from Friday's $6.74.

   Nearly a year after he began his
firsthand study of the capitalist system, Soviet economist Mikhail
Popov says he's ready to put his knowledge to work as part of the
sweeping reform in his homeland.
   ``I will use the ideas of American scholars,'' said Popov, a
regional economist for the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Union's
Academy of Sciences. ``Many of them are new and up-to-date and not
available in the Soviet Union.''
   Popov has studied such capitalist cornerstones as rents,
interest rates and prices since his arrival last September at West
Virginia University's Regional Research Institute under an
international exchange program.
   ``When I look at things in the United States, I usually think
`How can I use them to restructure our economy?''' Popov said. ``I
also look at the history. What worked and what didn't?''
   During an interview on the eve of his scheduled Fourth of July
departure, the 35-year-old expert on Soviet industrial production
said he was anxious to share his experience with colleagues who are
intimately involved in ``perestroika'' _ Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's effort to overhaul the Soviet system.
   Popov said his study of the decline of the steel industry in
Pittsbugh and of coal mining in Appalachia could help ease the
transition of the Kuzbass region of Siberia, where much of the
country's heavy industry once was centered.
   ``We have similar problems in some areas and wanted to look at
the tremendous changes that have occurred in Pittsburgh, for
example, and study the optimal way to shift from basic industries
to high-tech,'' Popov said.
   Gorbachev began pressing for the restructuring of Soviet society
shortly after taking office three years ago.
   Last week, during a national meeting of the Communist Party, he
called for democratization, economic reform and changes in the
Soviet political system that he said would make perestroika
``irreversible.''
   ``Perestroika really is an expression of our society,'' Popov
said. ``It just didn't happen with a change of leadership. It was
inevitable, a natural evolution of the socialist system.
   ``We couldn't have avoided it,'' he concluded.
   Some commentators in the U.S. have said Gorbachev's attempts to
introduce market mechanisms into the Soviet system prove that
communism is doomed. Others in the Soviet Union say Gorbachev has
gone too far too quickly.
   Popov, an unabashed Gorbachev supporter, said he disagreed on
both counts.
   ``I'm not afraid that we will lose the main ideas of
socialism,'' said Popov. ``If someone is willing to produce much
more than the other guy and works harder, he deserves to be
rewarded.
   ``That doesn't threaten socialism at all.''
   During his stay, Popov also has presented several papers on the
Soviet economy, visited Penn State University and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technolgy and given dozens of lectures.

   Solar energy and fuels made from crops can
help combat the ``greenhouse effect'' that some scientists claim is
partly responsible for this year's drought, say officials at the
Solar Energy Research Institute.
   But scientists at the institute caution that it will take
several decades to reverse damage already done to the environment.
   ``There is no quick fix. That's one of the very scary things
about global weather change,'' said Dr. Tom Bathe, manager of
SERI's office of analysis and evaluation.
   Scientists say the ``greenhouse effect'' is caused by pollutants
created by the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide represents
about half of the pollutants; other gasses such as nitrous oxide
and methane comprise the rest.
   The pollutants create an envelope around the Earth that does not
allow reflected heat to leave the atmosphere and causes
temperatures to grow warmer.
   James Hansen, climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute of Space
Sciences, told the Senate Energy Committee recently that the
``greenhouse effect'' will make droughts like this year's more
likely.
   He and other scientists have said that 1988 is likely to set a
record for global average temperatures. Scientists have observed
that the four hottest years to date globally all have occurred in
the 1980s.
   Worst-case scenarios by scientists show average temperatures
rising 3 to 9 degrees by the middle of the next century and seas
rising about a foot as the polar icecaps melt.
   ``Even if we were able to shut off all the carbon dioxide and
methane produced today, we would still face significant change'' in
the world's weather because of the existing `greenhouse,''' Bathe
said.
   Congress created SERI when oil prices shot up in the 1970s. Its
mission was to find clean energy sources that would be alternatives
to fossil fuels. Staff and budget cuts during the Reagan
administration have taken a toll on the agency, but its scientists
are continuing their research.
   Some SERI proposals for curbing the ``greenhouse effect''
include:
   _Widespread use of biomass liquid fuels from crops. The crops
would absorb as much carbon dioxide while they are being grown as
they would produce when burned as transportation fuels.
   _Use of photovoltaic cells _ man-made silicon chips that
chemically convert natural light to electricity _ to replace fossil
fuel-fired power plants.
   _Using thermal systems _ which convert heat captured directly
from the sun _ to replace fossil-fuel heat sources.
   Although coal is the biggest carbon dioxide producer among the
fossil fuels, ``everybody expects coal to be the most rapidly
expanding component'' in the future, Bathe said.

<HEAD>Beazer Arranging Sale of Koppers Unit, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beazer PLC is expected to announce the sale of
Koppers Co.'s chemical unit to a group of managers in a leveraged
buyout valued at $550 million to $650 million, a report published
Monday said.
   Beazer, the British construction firm that agreed to acquire
Koppers last month for $1.81 billion, is expected to announce a
preliminary agreement by Tuesday, according to The New York Times.
   Brian Beazer, who heads the company, announced before the merger
agreement was signed that he intended to sell Koppers' chemical and
allied products division. The Times said the division accounted for
about 40 percent of the Pittsburgh-based company's $1.5 billion in
revenue last year.
   Under terms of the merger agreement, Beazer granted Koppers
management 45 days to draw up a buyout plan before he offered the
unit to other potential purchasers. That period was then extended
until Aug. 5.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy a company
and then pay off debt with the target company's cash flow or the
sale of its assets.
   Sterling Group, a Houston-based investment bank run by Gordon A.
Cain, will provide financing for the buyout, the paper said.
   Cain, according to the Times, has played a major role in recent
years in reviving troubled companies in the refining and chemical
industries. In April, Cain sold Cain Chemical Co. to Occidental
Petroleum Corp. for $1.25 billion in cash and the assumption of $1
billion in debt.
   The Times said the involvement of Cain is likely to give the
deal considerable credibility in the chemical industry.
