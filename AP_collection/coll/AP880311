   The victim of a 1983 traffic accident would
not want to be kept alive in the helpless state in which she has
been maintained, the woman's older sister testified at a
right-to-die trial Thursday.
   Last year, the parents of 30-year-old Nancy Cruzan, who is in
what doctors call a ``persistent vegetative state,'' sued the state
to force doctors to allow her to die by removing a feeding tube
from her stomach.
   It is the first case in Missouri to address the question of
whether food and water can be denied patients like Ms. Cruzan.
   Assistant Attorney General Robert Presson contends Missouri law
prohibits such a step. Staff members at the State Rehabilitation
Center at Mount Vernon said removing the feeding tube would violate
their medical mission.
   Doctors say Ms. Cruzan's brain stem was nearly the only part of
her brain left intact after she was deprived of oxygen for several
minutes after the accident.
   On Thursday, the second day of trial in Jasper County Probate
Court, her older sister, Christy White, testified that Ms. Cruzan
was a vital, sometimes headstrong, woman who had said on at least
two occasions that she would not want to live if she could not do
so independently.
   Her father, Joe Cruzan of Carterville, said he could ``see no
purpose in forcing her to go through the indignities she's going
through now.''
   ``When she has a bowel movement, they have to change her
diaper,'' he said. ``I know the hospital does the best it can, but
Nancy drools. Sometimes ... her hair will be wet, the pillow, her
gown. I just feel like it's beneath her dignity to continue like
this.''
   Lisa Perrin, a nurse at the rehabilitation center who said she
has seen Ms. Cruzan daily for the past three years, testified: ``I
was trained to preserve life and I don't want to enhance death.''
   Dr. James C. Davis, Ms. Cruzan's physician, said that a legal
ruling would help him make a decision but that he still would
hesitate to counsel the Cruzan's to pursue their plan.
   ``Mentally, they're going to have problems somewhere down the
line that they brought about the death of their daughter,'' he
said. ``And if they don't do it, they will have the same problem
with her continued suffering. Either way, they're going to have
problems.''

<HEAD>Human Rights Groups Report Continued Atrocities in 1987</HEAD>

   The people of Afghanistan continued to suffer
human rights abuses at the hands of both government and rebel
forces last year, according to a report by two groups that monitor
human rights.
   The March report of the U.S. Helsinki Watch Committee and the
Asia Watch Committee is based on a September-October fact-finding
mission to Pakistan, Afghanistan's neighbor to the south and a base
for opposition forces fighting the Soviet-backed government.
   The report's authors said all requests to visit Kabul or other
cities under the government's control went unanswered.
   ``Afghanistan has been the scene of some of the most serious
human rights violations on record,'' the report said. ``About
one-half of the country's prewar population ... is either in
emigration, or internally displaced, or dead.''
   The report, the committees' fourth on human rights violations in
Afghanistan since 1984, noted that most abuses reported previously
had continued. The government is guilty of most of the abuses, it
said.
   ``Indiscriminate warfare in the countryside combined with
totalitarian controls in the cities have brought incalculable
suffering to the Afghan people,'' it said.
   Resistance groups also were accused of violations, as in
previous reports.
   ``We continue to deplore the execution of prisoners of war by
the resistance, often after a trial that is lacking in most aspects
of what we consider due process,'' the report said.
   It specifically mentioned abuses by the Hezb-I-Islami resistance
group, led by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar.
   ``Abuses by this group seem to have become even more extreme in
the past year and reportedly include politically motivated
assassinations, the taking of hostages,'' the committees said.
   If a settlement is reached in Afghanistan's civil war, the
committees said, the Hezb-I-Islami and other groups ``guilty of
gross human rights violations'' should not be given much influence
in a new government.
   The report noted ``seemingly positive developments'' in 1987,
including the government's call for refugees to return to
Afghanistan and amnesty declarations for thousands of prisoners.
   The New York-based U.S. Helsinki Watch Committee was founded in
1979 to promote domestic and international compliance with human
rights provisions of the 1975 Helsinki accords.
   The Washington-based Asia Watch Committee was founded in 1985 to
promote internationally recognized human rights in Asia. Both are
private, non-profit groups.

   A page of notes jotted by President John F.
Kennedy during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis sold for $10,000 at
auction Thursday.
   The unsigned page includes the words ``bombers'' and
``Alpha-66,'' code for a group of Cuban exiles who conducted
commando raids on the country, said auctioneer Herman Darvik.
   At the bottom of the note is the start of a draft of a letter to
Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev, Darvik said.
   The note, which had been owned by a private dealer, was
purchased by the American Museum of Historical Documents, a private
dealer in Las Vegas that has a large Kennedy collection, he said.
   Other items sold Thursday by Herman Darvik Autograph Auctions
were a signed photograph of Sitting Bull, which brought $3,500; a
signature of George Washington clipped from a document, $2,750, and
a letter from Marilyn Monroe to her lawyer, $1,650.
   A photo of Air Force One signed by Presidents Ronald Reagan,
Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford went for $2,750, Darvik
said.

<HEAD>One in Three Smokers Dies Prematurely, Cancer Society Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 35 percent of smokers die prematurely
because of tobacco, the American Cancer Society estimates.
   ``If smokers could just think of those odds as twice as bad as
those for Russian roulette, they might understand how dangerous the
cigarette habit really is,'' Harmon Eyre, national society
president, said in a statement.
   The estimate refers to all tobacco-related causes of death, such
as lung cancer and heart disease, a cancer society spokesman said.
   It appears in the society's new publication, ``Cancer Facts &
Figures _ 1988.''
   Some 40 percent of male smokers and 28 percent of female smokers
die prematurely, the society said.
   The estimate is derived from population data, and the higher
percentage for men reflects the fact that men have historically
smoked longer and in greater amounts than women, rather than any
significant sex-based difference in risk for individual smokers,
the society spokesman said.
   The society estimates that smoking is related to 320,000 deaths
a year, including 30 percent of all cancer deaths. It blames
cigarettes for 85 percent of lung cancer cases among men and 75
percent among women.
   Among males, smokers run more than twice the rate of non-smokers
for cancer death, while among women the difference is 67 percent,
the society says.
   The society also said lung cancer remains the nation's leading
cancer killer within each sex. Some 152,000 new cases are expected
this year, with 139,000 deaths.

<HEAD>Treasury Police Head Fired After Suspected `Panel Truck of Death'
Found</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALFONSO ANZUETO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government fired the director of the
treasury police after authorities found his agents in a truck
believed to have been used in several recent kidnappings,
authorities said Friday.
   Six of those abducted in the ``panel truck of death'' were
killed, a human rights group said.
   The firing of Oscar Diaz Urquizu, a former security chief for
President Vinicio Cerezo, came after the truck was discovered by
national police.
   Army Col. Julio Caballeros Seigne, the national police director,
said he and members of his personal security guard found the truck
Thursday parked eight miles east of the city.
   The six men inside were wearing treasury police uniforms,
Caballeros Seigne said.
   Baudilio Hichos, third in command of the treasury police,
arrived at the scene to try to free his men.
   The dispute continued at a downtown Guatemala City police
station, where about 100 treasury policemen arrived to defend the
six. After arguing with national police for an hour, they left.
   Interior Minister Juan Rodil Peralta announced the firing Friday
after meetings with heads of both security groups. He named Miguel
Equizabal, second in command, as his interim replacement.
   The six treasury policemen were in custody for questioning on
Friday but had not been charged. Their names were not disclosed.
   Treasury police are assigned to deal with customs matters, but
are said to be involved in other operations. Diaz Urquizu was chief
of security for the campaign of Cerezo, who took office Jan. 14,
1986 as the first civilian president since 1970.
   The Mutual Support Group, an organization of relatives of people
who disappeared in political violence, says six of nine people
known to have been abducted this year by men using a white panel
truck with darkly tinted glass were killed.
   Three others were released, said Herlindo Hicho, a spokesman for
the group.
   It called the vehicle ``the panel truck of death.'' Authorities
had said for several weeks that they were looking for the truck and
had seized or stopped several of the same description.
   Police said they believed the truck stopped Friday night was the
one they had been seeking.
   The number of disappearances and political killings in Guatemala
has declined from the early 1980s when there were as many as 500
killings a month, but cases continue to occur.
   Left-wing insurgents have been fighting the government
sporadically for 25 years.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Friday
attacked U.S. peace proposals for the first time in public, saying
they were ``fraught with danger'' and incapable of bringing peace
to the region.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz shuttled through the
region last week to urge Arab and Israeli acceptance of the plan.
   ``The only word I agree with in the U.S. plan is the name
Shultz,'' Shamir was quoted as saying by the Israeli daily
newspaper Haaretz.
   Shamir previously has criticized elements of the U.S. proposal
in private meetings with party officials, but statements published
Friday in a series of interviews constituted his first rejection of
the plan as a whole.
   Shamir's comments on the plan were criticized by a high-ranking
official in Israel's left-of-center Labor Party, which shares power
in a shaky coalition with Shamir's rightist Likud bloc.
   ``It would be extremely artificial if the American people hear
only one unauthorized version,'' former Foreign Minister Abba Eban
told Israel radio.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Shamir's rival and a leader of
the Labor Party, supports the plan.
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, has rejected the U.S. plan, The New York Times
reported in its Saturday editions. It said that in an interview
Thursday in Tunis, Tunisia, where the PLO has its headquarters,
Arafat said the PLO would no longer settle for indirect
representation through a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation as
suggested by Shultz.
   Earlier this week, Arafat's Fatah branch of the PLO had
criticized the U.S. plan.
   Israel and the United States consider the PLO a terrorist
organization. Israel has declared it will never negotiate with the
PLO but would consider talks with a combined delegation of
Jordanians and non-PLO Palestinians.
   In Cairo, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Jordan's King
Hussein said Friday that Shamir would pit himself against world
opinion if he rejects the U.S. peace plan.
   ``I don't think that this (Shamir's comments) will lead to a
comprehensive settlement or a comprehensive peace which is very
important for the whole area and the whole world,'' Mubarak told
reporters after a 3{-hour meeting with the Jordanian leader.
   ``I agree,'' Hussein said.
   Shultz has requested an Israeli decision on the plan by the time
Shamir arrives in Washington on Monday and has publicly complained
that both the Arabs and the Israelis are unwilling to compromise.
   The plan calls for Israel to give up land in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for peace in the region.
   Shamir said he was particularly disturbed by the part of the
U.S. proposal that calls for kicking off direct negotiations with
an international conference.
   That, he told the English-language Jerusalem Post, ``obligates
me to resist ... with all my power. And my power to resist is very
great.''
   He said the United States had changed its position on the
convening of such a conference without reason and he warned the
proposal was ``fraught with danger.''
   Shamir told Haaretz that while the United States is undeniably a
friend to Israel, ``every bit of it (the U.S. plan) was an attempt
to satisfy the Arabs.''
   The right-wing leader has twice blocked Cabinet votes on whether
Israel should approve the plan.
   The issue is expected to come up a final time before the Shamir
trip during a Cabinet meeting Sunday.
   Eban, a member of Peres' Labor Party, announced Friday he would
travel to the United States hours before Shamir to explain Labor's
position on the peace plan to the Americans.
   ``The fact is that Mr. Shamir did not get any authorization to
refuse the peace plan. No parliament, and no Cabinet agreed to this
refusal,'' Eban said on Israel radio.
   Speaking on Israel radio, Shamir said he would explain to Shultz
``that his plan, as it is seen today, can't solve the problem of
peace in our area and can't guarantee the safety and security of
the state of Israel.''
   Despite Shamir's tough stand, U.S. officials are still hopeful
that Shultz and Reagan may be able to persuade the prime minister
to change his mind, diplomatic sources said.
   Shamir, however, stressed that he will bring the Americans his
own suggestions on how to make the plan more acceptable.
   ``This paper (the plan) given to us is not Moses' commandments
from Mt. Sinai,'' Shamir said on the radio.
   Shamir aide Yossi Ahimeir told The Associated Press the prime
minister would suggest implementing Palestinian self-rule in the
territories on a step-by-step basis, testing the idea in a single
city, for example.
   In addition, the prime minister will suggest that instead of an
international conference, peace talks be held under Soviet-American
auspices, Ahimeir said.
   Finally, Ahimeir said, the prime minister wants a more flexible
timetable than that sought by Washington, which has called for
starting talks on an interim solution in the territories by May and
opening negotiations on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza
by December.
   Shamir wants to delay talks on the final status until self-rule
is implemented throughout the territories, his aide said.

   Japan's latest comic book heros are Emperor
Hirohito and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   Comic books, widely read in Japan by both children and adults,
often are used as teaching aids for such topics as history,
economics or etiquette and even to explain frictions with the
United States over trade.
   The Hirohito comic book, which is in hard cover and is titled
``Tenno Heika'' (Emperor), follows the 86-year-old monarch from
childhood through World War II, including his historic surrender
broadcast in 1945, and into his quiet retirement in Tokyo's
Imperial Palace.
   The book on Nakasone is called ``Yatchan's,'' which was the
former prime minister's childhood nickname. It is published
quarterly by Nakasone's office and sent to supporters and
constituents.
   Japanese prime ministers, once they step down, traditionally
fade into the political background and take the role of party
elder, occasionally seen but seldom heard.
   But Nakasone, whose term in office ended this past November, has
stayed in the news through trips abroad and the establishment of a
think-tank group. ``Yatchan's'' helps keep attention focused on him.
   ``The idea for a cartoon newsletter has been gestating for a
long time, and it just happens that it was produced after
Nakasone-san left office,'' said Masaki Donji, a private secretary
to Nakasone. ``There was no deliberate timing to keep him in the
news.''
   While purporting to depict faithfully the characters' lives and
careers, the comic books seem overly flattering.
   Hirohito is shown as barrel-chested and cheerful rather than the
aged and stooped man he is now.
   Nakasone, now 67, is shown as burly, with round eyes and a
uncharacteristic full head of hair.
   But the comic book presents little-known facets of Nakasone's
life.
   An essay by Nakasone's wife Tsutako says that, in his younger
days when he was known as Yatchan, Nakasone pranced about in his
underwear after baths, humming music from Swan Lake. And on state
visits abroad as prime minister, he grudgingly allowed his wife off
elevators first, but upon returning to Japanese soil, would
instantly declare, ``Ladies first is over.''
   ``Yatchan's'' opens with Nakasone's return from the 1987 summit
in Venice, Italy, with photos of the six in-flight meals he was
served on his special jet. It then flashes back to the beginning: a
fiery-eyed Nakasone resigning from Tokyo's Metropolitan Police
Department in 1946 to work toward Japan's postwar reconstruction.
   He reveals himself as an idealist who patterns himself after
Sakura Sogo, a 17th-century village headman who was executed for
seeking reduced taxes for poor peasants.
   He eats potatoes for lunch _ an expression of humility _ and
chooses a white bicycle for his first political campaign because
Hirohito rode a white horse.
   Subscriptions to ``Yatchan's'' are 2,000 yen ($15.50) a year.
The booklet also includes reproductions of Nakasone's paintings,
and samples of his haiku poetry.
   The Hirohito book divulges some imperial trivia: the emperor has
no surname, reached adulthood at age 18 (20 for ordinary Japanese),
and cannot adopt children or vote.
   It also explains that his duties include opening sessions of the
Diet (parliament), closing sessions of the House of
Representatives, receiving foreign ambassadors, and formally
approving laws, government decrees, amendments to the constitution
and treaties.
   Hirohito, once regarded as a living god, remains a sensitive
subject in modern Japan, and ribbing of royalty by the press is
neither tolerated nor attempted.
   But the comic book touches on some sensitive points in the
emperor's life, including an assassination attempt, the great Kanto
earthquake of 1923 for which Hirohito was later criticized for not
doing enough for his people, and a 1936 military rebellion that led
to the death of one of his favored ministers.
   It also touches briefly on his role in World War II, although it
reveals little about his activities or motivations during the
conflict, and portrays Hirohito's famed speech imploring the nation
in August 1945 to bear the unbearable _ surrender.
   The emperor's trips to Europe and the United States are shown,
including protesters waving signs saying ``Go Home'' and ``Fascist
Hirohito.'' It ends with him enjoying his favorite pastimes,
walking along the beach and studying marine biology.
   An official of the Imperial Household Agency, which tends to the
imperial family's duties and needs, said the agency had nothing to
do with the comic book and extended neither approval or assistance
in its production.

   Graffiti, the ubiquitous writing that is
spray-painted on mosques, schools and shops, is a guide to
political happenings in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   From the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem to the farmlands of Gaza,
the walls are a bulletin board for political groups to proclaim
their ideologies and issue public appeals.
   ``Let the Gaza Strip be in flames for Shultz,'' said a wall in
Gaza City shortly before the recent Middle East shuttle of
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   A slogan in black paint on the wall of the Beit Al May refugee
camp in the West Bank declared: ``Disgrace will face collaborators.
Glory to our heroic martyrs.''
   It was signed by the United National Leadership of the Uprising,
a name used by supporters of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   A more religious tone was struck nearby: ``Paradise for our
martyrs'' and ``God is great. Victory to Islam.''
   This was signed by Hamas, Arabic for zeal, the signature of the
Moslem Brotherhood, a fundamentalist Sunni Moslem group that
opposes PLO support for a negotiated settlement.
   ``Islam is the solution and the alternative,'' said a slogan
signed by the ``Islamic resistance,'' also believed to be the work
of Moslem Brothers.
   Other wall decorations in the occupied territories were signed
by ``Shaabiya,'' George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, and ``Democratia,'' Nayef Hawatmeh's Democratic Front
For the Liberation of Palestine.
   One was the work of supporters of Abul Abbas, the mastermind of
the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985.
   On the Mount of Olives, a wall declared, ``Palestinian-Arab
solidarity lives on.''
   This slogan, possibly written by supporters of Jordan, is a
rarity because sentiment in the West Bank and Gaza has been
strongly against Arab states.
   The feeling is that Arab states have failed to support the
rebellion against Israeli occupation and some, notably Jordan, fear
that the revolutionary fervor will cross its borders.
   As a result, slogans supporting Syria, Damascus-based
Palestinian groups and Jordan's King Hussein, are noticeably absent.
   In Gaza City, residents of the well-to-do Ramali neighborhood
were chastized by a piece of graffito scrawled on the mosque in
Palestine Square: ``Courage to the people of the Ramali quarter,''
it said, mocking the inaction of the middle class.
   Some wall-writing has called for specific action, such as ones
in Gaza that demanded the resignation of Arab tax collectors and
Arab police officers.
   ``Arab employes of the income tax and value added department
must resign. Otherwise we will,'' said the chilling warning in
downtown Gaza City.
   Forty taxmen quit their jobs as directed and new graffiti
written in blue spray paint replaced the old: ``Yes, yes for the
step taken by our honorable brothers in resigning from the tax
department ... and yes to the resignation of the police.''
   Moderates have also come in for a pounding on the walls, which
tend to reflect more hardline views. ``Down with Hanna Siniora and
Fayez Abu Rahme,'' declared a slogan attacking the two Palestinians
who met with Shultz in Washington last month
   Israel's army has periodically tried to censor the wall writing.
   In Nablus, a reporter saw Arab prisoners watched by armed
Israeli soldiers using black paint to blot out slogans such as
``Death to Israel'' written in red on the metal shutters of shops.
   The political graffiti has also spread to Israel, where the
division between left and right is played out on the walls of the
beachfront ``tayellet,'' or promenade in Tel Aviv.
   ``Arabs: go to the Arab world,'' said one declaration,
reflecting the extreme right-wing view that Arabs should leave
Israeli-held territory.
   ``Enough of the occupation,'' countered another, reflecting the
left-wing viewpoint that Israel should withdraw from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.

   The discovery in Spain of a car bomb destined for
Gibraltar was a relief to the British government, helping ease
political embarrassment by proving a tragedy had been averted by
the killing of three unarmed IRA members.
   Thwarting the Irish Republican Army operation in the British
colony through pooled British, Irish and Spanish intelligence was a
triumph for international cooperation against terrorism, but the
circumstances raised questions:
   Was it necessary to shoot the guerrillas dead when they were
unarmed? Why did Britain wait 24 hours to declare the falsity of
official reports that a car bomb already had been parked at the
Gibraltar governor's residence?
   The guerrillas were shot Sunday. On Tuesday, Spanish police
found a car laden with explosives in a parking lot at Marbella, a
resort about 45 miles up the coast of southern Spain from the
fortress colony.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's supporters said the discovery
vindicated the army in the shootings.
   ``I am delighted,'' said lawmaker Ivor Stanbrook, who heads a
Parliament committee on Nothern Ireland. ``This confirms all the
evidence which showed that the actions of the British security
services were absolutely justified.''
   Two men and a woman were shot down at midday Sunday as they
walked from a car they had parked at the governor's residence,
called The Convent. A public changing of the guard ceremony was
scheduled for Tuesday morning, involving a British army unit just
transferred from Northern Ireland.
   Men dressed in jeans did the shooting, and were said to be
members of the elite Special Air Services undercover unit. The SAS
has been involved in several operations against the outlawed IRA, a
mainly Roman Catholic group fighting to drive the British from
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland.
   Protests came from the Irish Republic and from inside Britain.
   The mass-circulation press backed Mrs. Thatcher but the Daily
Telegraph, usually pro-government in Irish matters, said Britain
should ``give ill-wishers no further grounds to suggest that the
authorities operate a `shoot-to-kill' policy against terrorists.''
   In Dublin, the respected Irish Times commented: ``There is
emerging a profound difference between British and Irish attitudes
on the proper response which is demanded by terrorism.''
   Immediately after the shootings, Spanish police and British
officials in Gibraltar spoke of a ``gun battle'' and a ``car bomb.''
   Then the IRA said early Monday the slain trio were in Gibraltar
``on active service,'' reinforcing Britain's contention that the
bomb was in place.
   Britain's armed forces minister, Ian Stanley, described the car
parked near the governor's residence as a ``car bomb'' and British
press reports spoke of hundreds of pounds of explosives.
   Not until Monday afternoon did Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreign
secretary, tell a surprised House of Commons there were no
explosives in the car and police were searching for another vehicle.
   Official British sources say confusion arose because of
assumptions based on Spanish intelligence and underlined by the IRA
reference to ``active service.''
   Why the immediate resort to gunfire? The response was that
security forces could not be sure the guerrillas were not armed.
   Reporters in London were told Mairead Farrell, an IRA veteran,
``fumbled in her handbag,'' and ``could have been going for a gun,
for some explosive device, anything.''
   On Tuesday, the Irish government said it was ``gravely
perturbed'' that unarmed Irish people ``should have been shot dead
... when it appears they could have been arrested.''
   This enraged British officials and one said privately: ``A lot
of British people are beginning to wonder if they (the Irish) are
serious about combating terrorism.''
   British officials said the 145 pounds of explosives packed into
the car found at Marbella, timed to explode during the military
ceremony Tuesday, could have killed more than 100 people. The
guerrillas apparently parked the first vehicle to secure a space
for the car bomb when arrived later.
   The shooting came at an awkward moment in Anglo-Irish relations.
   Tensions arose in January when Britain announced it would not
prosecute Northern Ireland police officers involved in killing six
Roman Catholics, five of them guerrillas but unarmed, in three
incidents at the end of 1982.
   Those shootings had ``remarkable similarities'' to that in
Gibraltar, the Irish Times said.
   Soon after the government announcement, a British soldier in a
watchtower shot an unarmed Catholic civilian dead at a checkpoint
on the Irish border. The soldier, who is in custody, said it was an
accident but the Irish government ordered its own inquiry.

<HEAD>Eastern to Appeal Contempt Citation</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines says it will appeal a
contempt-of-court citation imposed by a judge who ruled that plans
to transfer the airlines' shuttle operations to a new corporate
entity violate a 1987 injunction.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt ruled Thursday that the
Miami-based airline was in contempt of his July 2, 1987 order that
it maintain the status quo in working conditions for 12,000
employees represented by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   Although the preliminary injunction issued last summer dealt
with a separate labor dispute, Pratt said his order also applied to
any plans to change the working conditions of union workers that
would create a major dispute as defined by the Railway Labor Act.
   The judge scheduled a March 18 hearing to determine what
sanctions to impose against Eastern. The judge could impose a daily
fine to force Eastern to halt its plans to transfer the shuttle to
a new corporate entity under its parent, Texas Air Corp.
   In a complicated financial deal announced last month, Texas Air
will purchase the shuttle operation for $225 million. The Federal
Aviation Administration must approve the transaction and give an
operating certificate to the new operator to take over the shuttle,
which operates between Washington, New York and Boston.
   Airline spokesman Robin Matell said ``Eastern's view is that the
court's ruling is incorrect and we intend to file an expedited
appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
We are confident the court will rule in our favor.''
   The union, meanwhile, said in a statement that ``the court's
order today sends a message to Texas Air that it is not above the
law and it too must comply with the Railway Labor Act.''
   Pratt found that the ``proposed transfer to Texas Air
significantly changes the working conditions of IAM members.''
   ``We find that the proposed `spin off' of Eastern's air shuttle
operations to the new Air Shuttle is not fundamentally different
from the proposed `spin off' of Eastern's fleet services employees
to Air Ground Services,'' the judge's opinion said.
   That spinoff, which was barred last summer, involved plans to
transfer ground crews and baggage handlers to a new subsidiary
called Air Ground Services Inc.
   Eastern's serious financial problems ``do not change the fact
that it proposed a `spin off' of the air shuttle ... is in clear
violation of our July 2, 1987 order, which, whatever doubts Eastern
had as to its meaning and application, it made no attempt to have
clarified or modified,'' the judge said.
   The judge noted that Eastern announced the deal a day after it
dropped its appeal of the preliminary injunction in the Air Ground
case.
   Pratt accepted the union's contention that spinning off the air
shuttle could undermine the machinists' bargaining position with
the company. If fewer than 50 percent of the Air Shuttle's
employees opt to join the IAM, machinists who transferred to the
new subsidiary from Eastern would be without union representation,
the judge noted.
   The decision is the latest in a series of complicated and often
bitter legal fights Eastern is having with its union.
   In a separate action, the Air Line Pilots Association is trying
to bar Eastern from contracting with an air freight hauler to train
pilots to operate the company's planes in the event of a strike
this spring.
   The pilots' union has asked another federal judge here to issue
a temporary restraining order to prevent the use of Eastern
aircraft by Orion Air Inc.
   So far, one plane has been leased to Orion to train pilots who
would fly Eastern aircraft in the event the pilots honor a strike
by the machinists union, according to court testimony. The union
contends this arrangement circumvents the labor contract that
specifies that only its members can operate Eastern planes.
   Eastern contends that the labor agreement does not prevent it
from leasing its aircraft to other companies.

<HEAD>Reagan Releases List of `Pork Barrel' Projects He Wants Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

   President Reagan has released a symbolic wish
list of projects he wants Congress to strike from its spending
plan, but there appears little chance Capitol Hill will pay much
attention.
   James C. Miller III, director of the Office of Management and
Budget, said that if the list were adopted the savings for fiscal
1988 alone would amount to $1.15 billion.
   Miller, who released the list Thursday, said the money saved
could be used either to reduce the deficit or pay for more
meaningful projects.
   The items were included in the $600 billion catch-all spending
bill approved at the end of last year's congressional session.
   ``I'm hopeful Congress will respond to it,'' Miller said when
asked whether the cuts had any chance of gaining congressional
attention.
   The list, which has no legal power, has no effect unless
Congress moves to adopt it. The president's request was not in the
form of legislation and even when he has made such requests
formally, they have received little support in Congress.
   Reagan's effort appears to fall short of the pledge he made in
his State of the Union address in January.
   In his speech, Reagan repeated his longstanding request for the
line-item veto, which would allow him to delete specific items from
Congress' spending bills.
   In lieu of such power, Reagan said he intended to send back to
Congress, ``in 30 days ... those items, as rescissions, which if I
had the authority to line them out, I would do so.''
   Instead of sending the formal rescissions to Congress, Reagan
sent the informal list.
   Miller explained that the president decided not to send the
formal rescission list because many members of Congress had argued
such an action would upset the bipartisan agreement on the budget
reached last year by the White House and Congress.
   ``This is not an ordinary year,'' Miller said, referring to the
lengthy negotiations that produced the budget agreement.
   GOP sources on Capitol Hill, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the strategy was adopted to avoid election-year
clashes with Republican lawmakers who won spending projects for
their home districts last year.
   In proposing a formal rescission, Reagan freezes spending on
those items for 45 days and gives procedural advantages to those in
Congress supporting the effort. After the 45-day period, the
spending would be restored unless the rescissions were approved.
   In his 46-page informal list, Reagan cited a myriad of projects
from around the country, including the construction of a ski lift
in Idaho, 15 building projects at universities or medical schools
and even a program to establish a fund to preserve lighthouses.
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, won approval for $6.4 million for a
Kellogg, Idaho, gondola in the $600 billion spending bill approved
late last year. The money was in appropriations for a Forest
Service program that is supposed to pay for development and
management of forests.
   The 15 construction projects included $4 million for a cancer
research center at the Medical University of South Carolina and
$7.5 million for a pediatric research center at the Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   The list also included historic preservation grants with the
National Park Service that would establish a Bicentennial
Lighthouse Fund to distribute matching grants for the preservation
of lighthouses. The list did not give an exact amount for the item,
saying only that it amounted to ``less than $50,000.''

   Army bases across the country are running out
of tuition assistance funds for soldiers because of a $30 million
cut in the Army's education budget, according to college groups.
   The Army has put new restrictions on its tuition assistance,
which helped 188,000 soldiers and officers pay for college and
graduate school last year.
   Allan W. Ostar, president of the American Association of State
Colleges and Universities, said the cutbacks ``will have a direct
impact on thousands of individuals who want to take college
classes.''
   ``It will only hurt us all if individuals enlisted in the Army
do not have the opportunity to get the education they need,'' he
said.
   Frank Mensel, vice president of federal relations for the
American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, said the
Army has shifted ``education funds into recruiting.''
   Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, an Army spokesman, said the cutbacks were
triggered by Pentagon budget reductions that Congress and the
Reagan administration recently ordered to hold down the federal
deficit.
   The education budget was cut to $96.6 million. Originally, $35
million of the Army's $126 million education budget for fiscal 1988
was targeted for tuition assistance.
   Rixon said Army's personnel chief did have the option ``to move
money around'' among his education, civilian training and
recruiting accounts, ``but there was a relatively uniform reduction
across the board.''
   The college groups are lobbying to get at least $11 million
restored for tuition assistance. Even at that level, Ostar said,
``a number of programs would still come to a grinding halt, but at
least it is a more realistic and equitable approach to budget
reduction.'''
   The Army has requested a total education budget of $104 million
for fiscal 1989, which starts Oct. 1.
   Many soldiers pursue their college or graduate studies at state
campuses and community colleges near military bases.
   The Army once covered 90 percent of a G.I.'s cost of taking
classes. Rixon said it now pays 75 percent of tuition costs, up to
$80 a semester hour for undergraduate study and $165 for graduate
study.
   He said area commanders are being allowed to tailor the program
to meet their local needs.
   But the Army has ruled out providing tuition assistance for
soldiers who are entitled to Vietnam-era G.I. Bill benefits for
college, and it will not pay for a degree that is lower or lateral
to one a soldier already has.
   In general, subject to the area commanders' discretion, the Army
is not paying any tuition for lieutenant colonels or above, or
paying for graduate school for enlisted soldiers or warrant
officers, Rixon said.

   While Vice President George Bush is drawing most of the comment
in the foreign press after his Super Tuesday victories, the showing
of Democrat Jesse Jackson also is attracting attention. This is
what commentators abroad had to say about Jackson and Bush:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JESSE JACKSON:</HEAD>
<HEAD>Switzerland</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Basler Zeitung of Basel (independent): ``There is only one
charismatic personality among the candidates and his triumph will
resound longest after this Super Tuesday: Jesse Jackson has pushed
open doors in the `Deep South' that can never be closed again. Even
if _ as is expected _ he will be neither nominated nor become a
candidate for vice president, he has changed fundamentally the
political world for America's blacks.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Mainland China</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _XINHUA News Agency (government): ``Jackson, the only black
candidate, has the least campaign funds. His influence, however,
has increased greatly compared with his campaign in 1984, when he
won only one state in the South. This time he got five Southern
states on Tuesday. ... It is obvious that the American people are
not as open-minded as to select a black to be their president. It
is also impossible for the Democratic Party to nominate a black as
its candidate for the presidency.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Britain</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Independent of London (independent): ``The rejection of the
Rev. Pat Robertson as a serious presidential candidate in Tuesday's
Republican primaries was cheering news, while the relative success
of the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the Democratic race engenders a more
ambiguous mood. Neither man's foreign policy inspires confidence.
But their styles, in a campaign which is being fought almost
entirely on domestic issues, are very different. Mr. Robertson
looks inward while Mr. Jackson, for all his faults, reaches out. .
.. Mr. Jackson ... is a serious figure in a way that Mr. Robertson
is not.''
   _The Financial Times of London (independent): The ...
assumption, on the Democratic side, is that the Rev. Jesse Jackson
remains a containable political force. ... In policy terms, Mr.
Jackson is of the left of the Democratic Party, and on Super
Tuesday better aggregate, if not individual, results were achieved
by Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore, very much men of the
middle.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGE BUSH:</HEAD>
<HEAD>Denmark</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Politiken of Copenhagen (liberal): ``Like a second Muhammad Ali
before a title fight the otherwise colorless George Bush has
declared himself as the next President of the United States. ... He
is a conservative pragmatist _ some would say, an opportunist _
without strong views.
   ``As far as foreign policy goes he is clearly the most
experienced of all the candidates. If he becomes president, one can
expect a continuation of recent years' improvement in
American-Soviet relations as well as foreign trade policies of a
more liberal sort that certain young turks among the Democrats have
avowed.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Britain</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Guardian (liberal): ``Bush ... has the money and the
machine to cover the country. In some parts of America _ like the
South _ they like the continuity with Ronald Reagan that the vice
president seems to offer. Better the devil you've seen around a
lot. ... But no one, examining the attitude and exit polls from the
South, should too blithely assume that old George has roses all the
way to next November's real vote. He still isn't seen as much of a
leader by four-fifths of those who chose him. His views are
regarded as fuzzy; his trustiness is much in question.''
   _The Daily Telegraph of London (conservative): ``At this early
stage in the process by which America selects a president, Vice
President George Bush looks the most likely Republican contender. .
.. The prospect of Mr. Bush securing the final nomination is held
in some quarters to be good news for the Democrats; he carries
handicaps as well as the aura of the vice presidency.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Switzerland</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Der Bund of Bern (right of center): ``Bush takes the floor as
the administrator of the estate left by Reagan whose economic
policy appears to be successful to many Americans despite the
enormous increase of the debt burden. The whole thing recalls the
well-orchestrated campaign by Mondale in 1984 who won the
nomination without new ideas, without emotional appeal to the
voters, only to be badly beaten by Reagan.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _La Suisse of Geneva (independent): ``From now on, the
possibility of George Bush becoming president must be regarded as a
serious possibility. Against a Democratic Party from which genuine
contenders _ if there are any _ have not yet emerged, the race
seems almost easy for the vice president. The `Super Tuesday'
mountain has given birth to a mouse, and that one is feared to be
rather mousy.''

   Comedian George Burns may be 92, but it's
not slowing him down _ he's doing stand-up routines at casinos, has
just finished a movie and is working on a new book.
   ``There isn't anything I can't do now that I couldn't do when I
was 18 _ which shows you how pathetic I was at 18,'' he said during
a recent one-hour performance at Caesars Palace on the Strip.
   Burns is a regular at the Palace and other Caesars properties in
Lake Tahoe, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J. His new movie, ``18
Again,'' opens April 9.
   Burns' newest book is about the one true love of his life,
Gracie Allen, his stage partner and wife of 38 years until her
death in 1964.
   ``I've written six books. That's pretty good for a guy who only
read two,'' he told the audience at Caesars.
   His formula for acting?
   ``If the director wants me to cry, I think of my sex life,'' he
said. ``If the director wants me to laugh, I think of my sex life.
   ``I'd go out with women my age, but there are no women my age.''
   Burns smokes 15 to 20 cigars and drinks several martinis daily.
   What do his doctors think of that?
   ``They're all dead.''

   Comedian Bob Newhart says he watches every
episode of his ``Newhart'' televison show, but not the way the
average viewer would.
   ``I check to see what jokes we left out and what works and what
doesn't,'' he said in an interview published in the April issue of
Good Housekeeping.
   Newhart, 58, said his 1978 decision to end his role as
psychologist Dr. Bob Hartley on ``The Bob Newhart Show'' was the
result of ``burnout.''
   ``I thought we were beginning to repeat some of the situations
and the jokes,'' Newhart said. ``After 24 shows a year for six
years, I wasn't sure where the characters were going. I was proud
of the series, and didn't want to see it copying itself.''
   Despite the tiresome schedule of the earlier show, he said it
was inevitable that he would return to TV.

   Boxing great Archie Moore wants Americans down
for the count _ the 1990 U.S. census.
   ``People, in the black community especially, have not been
counted,'' Moore, 74, said at a U.S. Census Bureau open house
Thursday. ``Count your people. Stand up and be counted.''
   He said young people ought to help the census so people ``can
benefit from the programs in Washington they are eligible for.''
   St. Louis, one of three areas across the nation selected for a
1990 census dress rehearsal this month, was Moore's boyhood home
and the place where he won the light-heavyweight boxing
championship in 1952.
   Moore held the title until it was vacated in 1961. He failed
twice to win the heavyweight crown, losing to Rocky Marciano and
Floyd Patterson, but compiled a 183-22-9 career record including
129 knockouts. He now lives in San Diego.

   Broadway star Chita Rivera, who still feels pain
from the auto accident that shattered her left leg two years ago,

she's touring in.
   ``I'm not a Pollyanna; it hurts to dance,'' Rivera, 55, said in
an interview being published in Sunday's Parade magazine. ``But you
don't keep telling yourself that.''
   Rivera, whose left leg is held together by 12 screws, said she
asked the road show's producers for more dancing.
   The actress said that after her accident she never doubted she'd
dance again one day.
   She said she sometimes felt like quitting during physical
therapy, when ``I would feel like I was going to hit the ceiling.''
But her positive side prevailed.
   ``The spirit is the strongest thing there is,'' Rivera said.

   Tipper Gore, wife of Democratic

performer of ``I Want Your Sex.''
   Michael said Thursday he had been notified that his ``Faith''

   ``No doubt a few of those American sales came from Tipper Gore's

   ``Perhaps now she can help sell a few thousand more records
since her husband won big in the primaries,'' Michael said in

<HEAD>Chicago Tribune Endorses Dole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Tribune, Illinois' largest newspaper,
endorsed Republican Bob Dole in the state's presidential primary
even as the Kansas senator's campaign appeared to falter.
   In an editorial titled ``Why Illinois Should Pick Dole,'' the
newspaper said in its Friday editions that Dole needs a big primary
win to stay alive in his race against Vice President George Bush
for the GOP presidential nomination.
   ``The vice president's impressive qualifications and his
commanding lead notwithstanding, the Tribune hopes that Sen. Dole
gets that big win, and endorses him in the Illinois Republican
primary on Tuesday,'' the editorial said.
   Dole's campaign has been reeling from its dismal showing in the
Super Tuesday primaries. He pulled television commercials off the
air in Illinois and laid off more than half his staff Thursday.
   Campaign spokeswoman Dale Tate said Thursday that Dole intended
to remain a candidate, but a campaign aide, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said campaign officials were discussing whether the
Senate minority leader should withdraw from the Illinois contest.
   The very lead that Bush amassed on Super Tuesday was cited by
the Tribune as one of its reasons for endorsing Dole.
   ``The combination of Mr. Bush's incumbency and the personal
popularity of President Reagan has brought the vice president to
the brink of nomination without the kind of campaign test both he
and the Republican Party need to have a chance in November,'' the
editorial said.
   ``So far, the fight for the 1988 Republican nomination has been
a replay of the 1984 Democratic one, in which former Vice President
Walter Mondale muscled out all the challengers early and sailed on
to a mighty debacle in the general election.''
   While saying that Bush's identification with the administration
and policies of President Reagan gives him strength among
Republican primary voters, the Tribune suggested that
identification with Reagan might backfire in the general election.
   ``Nowhere have the Republican candidates asked or answered the
kind of harsh questions the Democrats surely will raise in November
about the Reagan administration, whose colors Mr. Bush has been
able to wave more furiously than anyone else,'' the editorial
continued.
   ``Yet voter concern over these issues shows up in opinion polls
that often reflect Sen. Dole as a stronger party standard-bearer
than Mr. Bush in match-ups with Democrats,'' it said.

<HEAD>Few Harsh Words As Democrats Meet At Illinois Dinner, Forum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The two home-state favorites in the Democratic
presidential fields got the most applause Thursday as five of the
party's presidential contenders appeared at an Illinois Democratic
Party dinner a few days before the state's critical primary.
   Right after the dinner they participated in a low-key forum
sponsored by the Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies.
   Unlike in the candidates debates held throughout the campaign,
there was no byplay between the contenders and not a cross word
about each other's positions.
   During both events, the candidates stuck closely to their
standard stump speeches.
   At the dinner, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, known for his trademark
bow ties and horn-rimmed glasses, drew laughter and applause when
he said, ``I want your vote in a beauty contest, believe it or
not.''
   Simon went on to say, ``I offer you not a 30-second commercial
but 30 years service to the people of this state and this nation.''
   ``You will not meet me through a commercial,'' said Jackson, the
other Illinois resident in the presidential race.
   Both Simon and Jackson and running bare-bones campaigns with
little or no money left for advertising. Dukakis is the only
Democrat with the funds to run a full-scale advertising campaign
directed at Illinois voters.
   Simon, who bypassed the Super Tuesday contests earlier this
week, is hoping to get back into contention with a strong vote from
his home state.
   Jackson did well on Super Tuesday and is regarded as a storng
contender in Illinois.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee also are bidding for
support in the primary.
   At the forum, Gore called for ``an all-out war on drugs'' and
repeated his new campaign theme that he wants to bring ``the
Democratic Party back to the neighborhoods.''
   Dukakis described himself at the forum as ``a full-employment
Democrat.''
   On foreign policy, he said, ``We've got to get a lot tougher on
South Africa,'' saying that ought to include tougher sanctions to
press that country to do away with its racial segregation policies.

<HEAD>Remington Artworks Are More Than A Wild West Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Frederic Remington, the painter and sculptor
best known for his depiction of the Wild West, deserves recognition
as an American master, say the curators of a traveling exhibit of
his work that opens here today.
   ``Remington has been seen superficially,'' says Michael Edward
Shapiro, chief curator at the St. Louis Art Museum. ``He's been
stereotyped as a cowboy artist when he was a very sophisticated New
Yorker who drew from a lot of sources and created his own style,
which has astonishingly imprinted itself on the conscience of our
country.''
   Shapiro and Peter H. Hassrick, director of the Buffalo Bill
Historical Center in Cody, Wyo., organized ``Frederic Remington:
The Masterworks,'' the first major traveling exhibit of Remington's
work.
   The exhibition consists of 46 paintings and drawings and 20
bronze sculptures Remington created from 1889, when he was 28,
until he died in 1909 at age 48 of complications from appendicitis.
   Among the works are ``A Dash for the Timber,'' an 1889 painting
acknowledged as Remington's first masterpiece, and ``The Bronco
Buster,'' possibly the best-known American bronze sculpture of the
19th century.
   Remington began his art career as an illustrator, with his Wild
West scenes turning up in several popular magazines, including
Harper's Weekly. His work illustrated what Shapiro describes as the
forces of nature and man and the risk of death and danger in the
West in the action and energy of Remington's horses and horsemen.
   He was especially successful at capturing the image of the horse
_ bucking, rearing, lunging, running at breakneck speed. ``There
was never a more vivid depiction of the American horse,'' Shapiro
adds.
   Indeed, Remington once told a drinking companion that if he
could have one thing written on his tombstone, it would be: ``He
knew the horse.''
   His subject was always the horse and its rider _ the
Indian-fighting soldier or the cowboy. But the West of the
homesteader, the farmer and the frontier-ending railroads held no
interest for him.
   ``While the rest of the country spoke of the advance of the
frontier, the `taming of the West,' as a positive force in the
building of American civilization, to Remington the frontier was
receding and, in the end, a tragic loss,'' historian David
McCullough writes in the show's catalog.
   Remington was born Oct. 4, 1861, in Canton, N.Y., the son of a
newspaper proprietor. He grew up in Canton and Ogdensburg, N.Y.,
then enrolled in the School of Fine Arts and joined the football
team at Yale University.
   He dropped out of Yale after a year and a half when his father
died and, at the age of 21, he headed west to make his fortune,
plunking down part of his inheritance on a sheep ranch near
Peabody, Kan.
   The sheep ranch failed, and Remington bought into a Kansas City
saloon, which also failed. His new wife had left him to go back to
New York. Remington headed west again to sketch his way through New
Mexico and Arizona.
   But by 1885, Remington was back in New York, reunited with his
wife and establishing himself as a magazine illustrator. In 1887,
Harper's Weekly carried 39 of his sketches and drawings, and the
next year more than 70.
   Remington's drawings also began to appear in St. Nicholas and
Outing magazines. He was commissioned by Century Illustrated
Magazine to illustrate a series of articles by a young Theodore
Roosevelt. The series later was made into a book titled ``Ranch
Life and the Hunting Trail.''
   Despite his popular success, Remington was never a critical
success, says Shapiro.
   His work was ``just seen as cowboys and Indians,'' he says,
``and there was a belief that cowboys and Indians wasn't serious
subject matter.''
   The exhibit goes next to the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in
Cody, Wyo., the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and closes at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

   A ruptured pipeline Feb. 17 spilled nearly
twice as much of a toxic chemical as thought, Sun Pipe Line Co.
said Thursday.
   In a statement from its Tulsa, Okla., headquarters, Sun said
that 176,000 gallons of toluene were missing after the break in the
pipeline, which leads from a Sun refinery in Toledo to one in
Marcus Hook, Pa.
   Earlier, officials estimated that between 80,000 and 100,000
gallons had leaked into a marshy area and made its way into the
Sandusky River.
   The spill forced the city of Fremont to evacuate 5,000 people
and impose a water emergency for several days until a method was
devised to filter the chemical out of the drinking water the city
draws from the river.
   Sun said a significant share of the additional amount that
spilled evaporated.

   Talks aimed at ending a four-day strike by
film and TV scriptwriters broke off Thursday.
   In New York, meanwhile, two unions representing 100,000 actors
set a March 21 deadline for a strike against makers of TV and radio
commercials.
   Talks between the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers and the striking Writers Guild of America had gone on
here under the auspices of a federal mediator.
   Marty Waldman, a guild spokesman, said the producers broke off
the talks.
   A spokesman for the producers, Herb Steinberg, said the
scriptwriters' demands are so unrealistic that ``further talks
would be fruitless. ... They're not even in the same neighborhood
in an assessment of the economics involved.''
   No new negotiations were set. The 9,000 scriptwriters walked out
Sunday over creative control and royalties from reruns.
   ``In view of the seriousness of the strike and its impact on the
industry, we had hoped that continued talks might bring us better
results,'' said Mona Mangan, executive director of the Writers
Guild of America-East.
   ``We deeply regret that the companies do not view these talks as
moving us closer together,'' she said.
   The strike, in its fourth day Thursday, has not yet had a
widespread effect on the movie and TV industry, but has delayed the
debut of at least two series and has forced the David Letterman and
Johnny Carson shows into reruns.
   It could shorten the TV season if producers failed to stock
enough scripts or discovered the need for extensive rewriting.
   In New York, leaders of the Screen Actors Guild and the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists announced a March 21
deadline for a strike against the American Association of
Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers.
   Union members voted 93 percent to 7 percent March 2 to authorize
a walkout, according to a statement from the unions. The last
strike of its kind lasted seven weeks in 1978-79.
   The current contract expired Feb. 6 but was extended while
negotiations continued over such key issues as the industry's
insistence on removing cost-of-living increases, and the union's
demand for higher compensation for commercials shown on cable
television, the union said.
   There was no answer Thursday night at the New York offices of
the American Association of Advertising Agencies. The unions
negotiate in the field of TV commercials. Radio commercials are
under AFTRA's jurisdiction.
   In a strike, SAG and AFTRA members would be asked not to perform
or audition for commerciials, and to terminate the producers' right
to use any commercial beyond its maximum period of use, the unions
said.
   Some of the most popular shows were near the end of their work
schedules when the scriptwriters went on strike. The episode
closing out the popular eight-year run of ``Magnum P.I.'' has been
written.
   ``I have a lot of projects that are jeopardized now,'' said
executive producer Jennifer Alward. ``There are options on books
that will run out if the scripts aren't delivered on time. If the
strike goes three months, what do I do?''
   Wes Kenney, executive producer of the ABC soap opera ``General
Hospital'' said: ``I have enough scripts to last me through any
strike.''
   Writers working on the Academy Awards ceremonies slated for
worldwide broadcast April 11 said they left its script half written
when they walked out. But producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. said: ``The
show must go on, and it will.''

   A former government employee, once
responsible for $1.3 million a year in Pentagon clothing contracts,
was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison for taking at least
$331,000 in bribes from manufacturers.
   Frank Coccia, for 15 years head of the Clothing and Textile
Directorate at the Defense Personnel Support Center, also was fined
$50,000 by U.S. District Judge Edmund Ludwig.
   The 55-year-old resident of Medford, N.J., had pleaded guilty to
racketeering and conspiracy in a plea bargain under which he also
agreed to forfeit $331,000 in bribe money.
   Coccia, whose crimes began in 1976 and continued for 10 yeras,
was charged in a corruption investigation, begun four years ago,
that has resulted in the conviction of nine companies and 15
individuals.
   Among them was former New Jersey legislator Joseph Chinnici, 68,
of Bridgeton, N.J., who faces sentencing April 8. He was convicted
of paying Coccia thousands of dollars to get contracts for his
clothing firm.
   ``Coccia influenced the awarding of hundreds of millions of
dollars in military contacts to corrupt companies'' in exchange for
cash, money orders, gold coins and securities he hid in his home,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Linda Hoffa.
   Coccia's crimes began in 1976 and continued for 10 years.
   ``The damage to the integrity of the military apparel
procurement system is incalculable,'' Ms. Hoffa said. ``It is
impossible to know whether the product or the integrity of the
product being purchased by the government was compromised.''
   Coccia told the judge: ``My one and only objective in my job was
to support the armed forces and I think I did that very well. I did
not compromise the quality of any product that was brought in.''

<HEAD>Government Pays Military But Faces Payroll For Public Servants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military regime of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega made its army payroll, but Panama's deposed
president and economists predicted it will not be able to pay civil
servants next week.
   That could further erode support for the general, chief of the
15,000-strong Panama Defense Forces and considered the real power
behind Panama's civilian government.
   The government had to withdraw substantial funds from the
central National Bank of Panama and divert receipts from
state-owned utilities in order to back the army payroll Thursday,
diplomatic sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In other developments Thursday, Panama's banks defied a
government order to reopen on a limited scale, saying there simply
wasn't enough cash available to do business.
   In Washington, the House voted overwhelmingly to demand
Noriega's ouster, and the Reagan administration considered imposing
sanctions on Panama, including withholding payments for Panama
Canal operations due by March 15.
   Also, the Panamanian government ordered five private television
stations to close indefinitely, but did not say why.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, whose Noriega-orchestrated removal from
the presidency Feb. 26 led to U.S. economic pressure, predicted the
government would not be able to meet its mid-March payrolls for
public employees.
   ``The government will not be able to pay all civil servants and
that will create another problem,'' Delvalle said.
   Delvalle, who has been in hiding since his ouster, made the
statement in a tape-recorded response to written questions from The
Chicago Tribune.
   He was dismissed hours after he tried to fire Noriega, who is
under federal indictment in the United States on charges of
trafficking in Colombian cocaine and money laundering.
   Attorneys representing Delvalle, who still is recognized by the
United States as Panama's legitimate president, have blocked the
transfer of an estimated $50 million in Panamanian government funds
held in U.S. banks.
   Popular resentment toward Noriega's regime could rise if it
cannot meet its obligations to workers after paying the military.
   Public school teachers and other government workers are
scheduled to receive their semimonthly paychecks Monday and
Tuesday. The total payroll, including the military's, is estimated
at more than $38 million, about six times the amount of money the
government reportedly has on hand.
   Private economists estimated the government's reserves at about
$5 million, making it unlikely it will be able to meet next week's
payroll.
   The National Banking Association, which represents 97 of the 118
financial institutions that make Panama a major international
banking center, said Thursday that its members ``are in no
condition to resume'' operations.
   The association on Wednesday had ordered its members to reopen,
but only to accept deposits and make transfers of funds between
banks, calling the move a ``first step'' toward resumption of full
banking services.
   But in a statement the following day, it said the government
still had not been able to guarantee its members enough money. A
run on deposits that began with opposition demonstrations last
summer and accelerated after Delvalle's ouster prompted the banks
to close on March 1.
   The government ordered the banks to close last week, saying it
could not provide them with enough money because of the legal
action in the United States.
   Panama's currency is the U.S. dollar.
   In an interview shown Thursday on the Caracol television chain
in Colombia, Noriega again denied drug trafficking charges and said
his accusers were paid $1.5 million to make their claims. He did
not elaborate.
   Noriega rejected ``for reasons of sovereignty and dignity'' the
possibility of his going to Florida to respond to the indictments.
   He said ``the North American assistant secretary of state for
Latin American affairs (Elliott Abrams) would not come to Panama to
confront a trial here for his confabulation against the Panamanian
state.''

<HEAD>Half of Super Collider Money May Be Foreign, DOE Says</HEAD>

   Energy Secretary John Herrington says foreign
money may pay for up to half the $4.4 billion superconducting super
collider project, and House committee members want the
international commitments before approving U.S. funds.
   Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, France, Italy and Canada are
interested in investing in the project, Herrington said Thursday in
testimony before the House Appropriations Committee's energy and
water development subcommittee.
   ``I fully expect you to see 40 (percent) to 50 percent of this
project will be international financing,'' Herrington said. ``I
think the money is there and the interest is there. It is an
international project.''
   Herrington's estimate of foreign participation was about double
the 25 percent level previously stated by department officials.
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., said
foreign money would help win congressional funding for the physics
research complex, which would include a 53-mile-round atom smasher.
   But he and Herrington differed on who should commit money first,
Congress or foreign investors.
   ``It seems to me this is the only way under our present budget
situation that we would even start this project, with the
participation of the countries,'' Bevill said.
   Herrington replied: ``It is not in the interests of the United
States government to say to the world, `We are the leaders in
high-energy physics and we are ready to take the next step, ... but
we are not willing to do that until we get foreign commitments.'
That's not leadership.''
   Bevill said he was considering how to pay for the project, while
Herrington was thinking of the United States being first in physics.
   ``Unless we can get allocated another billion dollars pretty
soon and start it ... we could not possibly initiate the funding,''
Bevill said. ``But if we had assurance 50 percent or 75 percent
would be contributed by other countries, it would be a whole new
game.''
   The Reagan administration has proposed spending $363 million for
super-collider construction in 1989, but critics in Congress say
that would divert money from other important research projects.
   Seven states have sites competing for the project, which will
produce 3,000 jobs and have an annual operating budget of $279
million.
   The states are Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North
Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.

   A strong earthquake shook Costa Rica
late Thursday, breaking windows in houses in southern cities near
the border with Panama, a fire department official said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   Firefighters in the Panamanian city of David said the tremor was
felt strongly in Panama's western provinces of Chiriqui and Boca
del Toro, both bordering Costa Rica, but there were no reports of
damage or injuries there either.
   The temblor was not felt in Panama City.
   The quake registered 5.6 on the Richter scale, said an official
in the communications office of San Jose's fire department. He
refused to be further identified.
   No one answered telephones at the Seismology Institute.
   The Red Cross said no damage was reported in San Jose, the
capital.
   The fire department official said the quake occured at 9:45 p.m.
(10:45 p.m. EST) and was centered near Buenos Aires, 70 miles
southeast of San Jose and 26 miles from the border with Panama.
   ``We have reports that the glass windows of many homes broke in
the towns of Buenos Aires, Ciudad Neily and San Isidro ... and we
are expecting possible reports of damage in Puerto Jimenez, near
Buenos Aires,'' the official said.
   San Isidro is 48 miles southeast of San Jose and Ciudad Neily is
seven miles from the Panamanian border.
   He said the quake also was felt strongly in the city of Golfito,
also near the border, but communications were poor and there was no
word of damage, he said.
   ``The people ran into the streets terrified in the cities of
Buenos aires and Ciudad Neily, since the temblor was really
strong,'' Johnny Zamora of the Red Cross in San Jose said.
   In San Jose, tall buildings swayed.
   ``Definitely the quake was felt practically in all the
country,'' the fire department official said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number indicates an increase of
10 times in ground motion.
   An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage. One
measuring 6 can cause severe damage, while a reading of 8 indicates
a quake capable of tremendous damage.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says he will try to persuade
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to drop objections to an
American peace plan for the Middle East.
   Reagan said Thursday that ``a great element'' of Israel's
coalition government supports the plan. He said the plan offers ``a
pretty good solution that would remove some of the problems
besetting the people in the occupied territories.''
   ``I believe that peace is inevitable,'' Reagan said. ``We may
have some differences there as to how to achieve it but I don't
think anyone believes that we can go on just with a constant state
of warfare and unrest (in the Middle East).''
   The president conducted four separate interviews in the White
House map room with television journalists from France, Britain,
Italy and West Germany. Transcripts of the remarks were released by
the White House.
   He criticized Israel's ban on press coverage of unrest and the
military's response in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   More than 80 Arabs have been killed by Israeli troops or
settlers since the demonstrations began late last year. Israeli
officials concerned about the negative publicity have now
restricted press access to the areas involved.
   ``I'm a great believer in a free press and the right of the
people to know ... so I would have to be opposed to it _ thinking
that they want to conduct operations in which they would rather not
have public knowledge of them.''
   Next week, Shamir will meet at the White House with Reagan to
discuss the administration's proposals. The prime minister has
blocked efforts to force a vote within Israel's government on how
to respond to the American plan.
   Shamir rejects the U.S. plan because it sets a timetable for
negotiations between Israel and the Arabs on the future of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Thirty U.S. senators have criticized Shamir
for rejecting an exchange of ``territory for peace.''
   Reagan, asked what kind of pressure he would put on Shamir,
said, ``Well, I don't think it's so much pressure as it is just an
attempt at persuasion.
   ``But also, I'd like to point out that his Cabinet is pretty
evenly split on the solution,'' Reagan said. ``So it isn't a case
of outside pressure there. He has a great element in his own
government that sees merit in the proposals that we've made.''
   Part of the U.S. plan calls for an international peace
conference whose members would include the Soviet Union.
   Reagan said Moscow has not recognized Israel as a nation and
added, ``That's very difficult to have someone participating in a
conference of that kind who doesn't even believe in the right of
statehood of the other country.''
   He said the conference would not be empowered to impose a
settlement, but would try ``to be helpful and see if we could not
join in helping arrive at a solution that would once and for all
end the hostilities.''
   On other subjects, Reagan:
   _Said the United States has made gains in talks with the Soviet
Union. ``There has been a softening in their position on human
rights and they have freed political prisoners and so forth,''
Reagan said. ``We think they have a long way to go to meet our
standard of human rights.''
   _Denied that his wife, Nancy, is his main adviser. ``No, and
she's very embarrassed about the press stories that for some reason
continue to say that. No, she has been a good and faithful wife,
and I share secrets with her and my problems and all of that.''

<TEXT>
   Elisabeth Ann Zinser resigned her position
early Friday as president of Gallaudet University, only five days
after her selection to lead the school for the deaf touched off a
storm of protest from students who demanded a hearing-impaired
president.
   The university's board of trustees said it had regretfully
accepted Zinser's resignation and would resume its search for a new
president.
   Gallaudet Board Chairman Jane Bassett Spilman called the
resignation a tragic loss to the university.
   ``We selected Dr. Zinser as president in recognition of her
superior academic, administrative and research skills. Her
strengths and accomplishments were precisely in those areas most
critical for the growth of the university,'' Spilman said.
   On Thursday, students capped the fourth day of protests by
declaring Zinser _ is not deaf and does not know sign language _
unelcome on campus and vowing to keep her out.
   Jerry Covell, a leader of the protests, hailed the resignation,
but said early Friday that students were still angry with Spilman,
who had resisted the push to oust Zinser, who is vice chancellor
for academic affairs at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro.
   ``We are glad that she resigned but we are still waiting for
Spilman,'' Covell said.
   In submitting her resignation shortly after midnight, Zinser
emphasized her concern that the very governance of Gallaudet had
been called into question by the week's events.
   The campus was virtually shut down for four days while a large
majority of the 124-year-old institution's 2,200 students
protested. The students had attracted members of Congress and
presidential candidates to their cause.
   Zinser had been named to head the university, the nation's only
liberal arts college for the deaf, on Sunday.
   ``I accepted the presidency when the board and I agreed that my
values, talents and experiences were well suited to the growth of
Gallaudet University in the higher education community as well as
the deaf community. This remains the challenge for the future of
Gallaudet,'' Zinser said in a statement released through a public
relations firm.
   She said her decision to resign was reached ``with great
difficulty as I came to understand how deeply some see the social
stature of deaf persons reflected in the presidency of this
university.''
   Students on Thursday threatened to seize the president's campus
house and office if Zinser made her way past students blocking
entrances to the school. The doors to the administration building
were chained shut, and no administrators were seen on campus.
   In other action on Thursday, one of the two deaf finalists for
the school presidency withdrew his support for Zinser and said he
would back the student protesters.
   A day earlier, I. King Jordan, dean of the school's college of
arts and sciences, had said he was supporting Zinser ``for the good
of the school.'' But Jordan told a student rally on Thursday that
he could no longer support the new leader.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who is a member of Gallaudet's board
of trustees, said in a statement Thursday he suggested to Zinser
that in the next few days she consult with the faculty, students,
staff and alumni ``to experience the passion with which they view
the appointment of hearing president.''
   ``The time is long overdue for Gallaudet University to have a
deaf president,'' Bonior said. ``The university has for generations
been an international mecca for excellence and opportunity in deaf
education.
   ``The question before us is _ How long will it be able to
sustain this important role without a deaf president?''
   Earlier, in an interview with The Washington Post, Bonior said
he told Zinser that federal aid for the school may be jeopardized
if she refuses to leave the post she was named to Sunday night.
   About 75 percent of the school's $76 million operating budget
comes from federal funds. The rest comes from tuition and grants.
   Meanwhile, the House Education and Labor subcommittee on select
education, which oversees Gallaudet's budget, scheduled hearings
for Tuesday on the controversy over the president and the makeup of
the board of trustees.
   Zinser had said Wednesday she was assuming her post immediately
instead of waiting until the original July starting date.
   She also lamented that campus protests have disrupted classes,
and said she would take unspecified steps to restore order if the
protests, which have been peaceful so far, took a violent turn.
   Besides calling for Zinser's ouster, the students want Spilman's
resignation, and a deaf majority on the 20-member trustees board,
which now has four deaf members.
   As Zinser attempted to start her job, support for the protesters
grew.
   Late Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson
issued a statement supporting the students, and called on
Gallaudet's board of trustees to ``resolve this dispute equitably.
   ``The problem is not that the students do not hear. The problem
is that the hearing world does not listen,'' Jackson said.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., another Democratic presidential
hopeful, on Thursday called for Zinser's resignation.
   Simon, a longtime member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
subcommittee on the handicapped, which has jurisdiction over
funding for Gallaudet, said Zinser's appointment was a ``slap in
the face to the entire purpose of the university.''
   Vince Dollard, a spokesman for the National Technical Institute
for the Deaf, in Rochester, N.Y., said two buses and several cars,
carrying at least 100 students from the school, were to leave at
midnight for Washington to join the Gallaudet protest.
   A rally was held on the Rochester campus in support of Gallaudet
Thursday afternoon.
   In addition, some East Coast leaders of the National Association
of the Deaf, a 20,000-member deaf rights group based in Silver
Spring, Md., were planning to gather in Washington on Friday,
spokesman Fred Weiner said.
   And activist Abbie Hoffman, who lectures to universities on
student protests, said, ``What's happening at Gallaudet is
obviously right there in the front,'' he said, ``and they're going
to win their battle.''
   He said he has urged members of three electronic bulletin-board
networks, with a total of 16,000 members, to support the students'
efforts by tying up Gallaudet's switchboards with calls of support
for the students.

<HEAD>Remington Artworks Are More Than A Wild West Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI DODGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frederic Remington, the painter and sculptor
best known for his depiction of the Wild West, deserves recognition
as an American master, say the curators of a traveling exhibit of
his work that opens here today.
   ``Remington has been seen superficially,'' says Michael Edward
Shapiro, chief curator at the St. Louis Art Museum. ``He's been
stereotyped as a cowboy artist when he was a very sophisticated New
Yorker who drew from a lot of sources and created his own style,
which has astonishingly imprinted itself on the conscience of our
country.''
   Shapiro and Peter H. Hassrick, director of the Buffalo Bill
Historical Center in Cody, Wyo., organized ``Frederic Remington:
The Masterworks,'' the first major traveling exhibit of Remington's
work.
   The exhibition consists of 46 paintings and drawings and 20
bronze sculptures Remington created from 1889, when he was 28,
until he died in 1909 at age 48 of complications from appendicitis.
   Among the works are ``A Dash for the Timber,'' an 1889 painting
acknowledged as Remington's first masterpiece, and ``The Bronco
Buster,'' possibly the best-known American bronze sculpture of the
19th century.
   Remington began his art career as an illustrator, with his Wild
West scenes turning up in several popular magazines, including
Harper's Weekly. His work illustrated what Shapiro describes as the
forces of nature and man and the risk of death and danger in the
West in the action and energy of Remington's horses and horsemen.
   He was especially successful at capturing the image of the horse
_ bucking, rearing, lunging, running at breakneck speed. ``There
was never a more vivid depiction of the American horse,'' Shapiro
adds.
   Indeed, Remington once told a drinking companion that if he
could have one thing written on his tombstone, it would be: ``He
knew the horse.''
   His subject was always the horse and its rider _ the
Indian-fighting soldier or the cowboy. But the West of the
homesteader, the farmer and the frontier-ending railroads held no
interest for him.
   ``While the rest of the country spoke of the advance of the
frontier, the `taming of the West,' as a positive force in the
building of American civilization, to Remington the frontier was
receding and, in the end, a tragic loss,'' historian David
McCullough writes in the show's catalog.
   Remington was born Oct. 4, 1861, in Canton, N.Y., the son of a
newspaper proprietor. He grew up in Canton and Ogdensburg, N.Y.,
then enrolled in the School of Fine Arts and joined the football
team at Yale University.
   He dropped out of Yale after a year and a half when his father
died and, at the age of 21, he headed west to make his fortune,
plunking down part of his inheritance on a sheep ranch near
Peabody, Kan.
   The sheep ranch failed, and Remington bought into a Kansas City
saloon, which also failed. His new wife had left him to go back to
New York. Remington headed west again to sketch his way through New
Mexico and Arizona.
   But by 1885, Remington was back in New York, reunited with his
wife and establishing himself as a magazine illustrator. In 1887,
Harper's Weekly carried 39 of his sketches and drawings, and the
next year more than 70.
   Remington's drawings also began to appear in St. Nicholas and
Outing magazines. He was commissioned by Century Illustrated
Magazine to illustrate a series of articles by a young Theodore
Roosevelt. The series later was made into a book titled ``Ranch
Life and the Hunting Trail.''
   Despite his popular success, Remington was never a critical
success, says Shapiro.
   His work was ``just seen as cowboys and Indians,'' he says,
``and there was a belief that cowboys and Indians wasn't serious
subject matter.''
   The exhibit goes next to the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in
Cody, Wyo., the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and closes at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

<HEAD>Officials Say Cleanup Costs At Weapons Plants Staggering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental cleanup at the nation's nuclear
weapons production plants could cost as much as $100 billion,
Department of Energy officials told a congressional panel.
   ``Cleaning up DOE's nuclear facilities may be the federal
government's biggest challenge,'' J. Dexter Peach, an assistant
comptroller general of the General Accounting Office, said in
testimony Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce hazardous
materials subcommittee.
   Joseph Salgado, undersecretary at the Energy Department, told
the panel that $100 billion in cleanup costs for all of the federal
facilities ``is probably in the ballpark.''
   The subcommittee is considering a number of bills designed to
strengthen enforcement of environmental laws at the nation's
weapons production plants, which are operated for the department by
private contractors.
   In a related development, The New York Times quoted Energy
Department officials in today's editions as saying the department
would sharply scale back the amount of radioactive material it
plans to bury in the nation's first permanent nuclear waste
repository.
   Department engineers said in interviews with the newspaper that
the department would entomb less than a quarter of the 125,000
barrels of plutonium-contaminated wastes the government earlier
intended to place in the planned $700 million repository in New
Mexico over the next five years.
   The decision came four months after scientists told a
congressional committee that enough water was seeping into the
repository to threaten its ability to safely store wastes that
would remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years.
   Last week, a panel of experts from the National Academy of
Sciences confirmed that water was entering the chamber and
recommended that the Energy Department entomb only enough waste for
experiments to determine the significance of the seepage.
   The water leaks are to be studied further to determine whether
current plans for the repository to receive even more waste can be
put into effect. The repository is being dug from salt beds 26
miles east of Carlsbad, N.M. and is to open next October.
   Winston Porter, assistant administrator for the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, acknowledged Thursday in the
hearing that the EPA has lost one of its levers in forcing
facilities to comply with environmental laws. The reason, he said,
is that the Justice Department has prevented the agency from using
its authority to go to court or issue unilateral orders.
   He said the administration has brought no court suits, issued no
unilateral orders, and entered into a handful of consent orders,
two enforceable compliance agreements and three unenforceable
agreements as part of its cleanup efforts.
   But Salgado told the subcommittee that the Energy Department has
recently made significant progress toward addressing environmental
contamination and has increased funding for cleanup by 62 percent
in fiscal 1989.
   Salgado said he has been told it will likely cost $1 billion to
begin cleanup at the Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald,
Ohio. The aging foundry processes uranium for use in nuclear
weapons.
   Joseph Legrone, the Energy Department's operations manager at
Oak Ridge, Tenn., said $105 million was budgeted for environmental
work at Fernald in fiscal 1988, more than the $102 million for
production. And he said $145 million has been earmarked for fiscal
1989.
   Legrone told Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, he hopes to be able to
assure that there is no leakage from Fernald's waste pits into
groundwater within a year and a half.

<HEAD>Nixon Says Military Ignores Possibility of `Small Wars'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Nixon in a new book criticizes the
American military establishment for ``preparing for the big war
that will probably never be fought'' and ignoring the possibility
of smaller wars.
   ``Moscow is most likely to seek to outflank Europe and Japan
with aggression in the Third World, where our nuclear power is
useless,'' he writes in ``1999: Victory Without War.'' ``If we fail
to develop the capability to parry Soviet thrusts in the Third
World, we will find ourselves unable to compete with Moscow.''
   Nixon's book, the sixth he has written since he resigned the
presidency in 1974, is to be published this spring by Simon and
Schuster. Like the last four, it deals with foreign policy. His
first post-White House book was his memoirs.
   He writes that Moscow is outspending Washington 4-to-1 in
providing military aid to other countries and that America must
continue providing ``tons of weapons'' to its allies to head off
the Soviet challenge.
   ``It is not philanthropy but expansionism that drives the Soviet
Union to pump weapons into the Third World,'' Nixon says. ``Its
goal in exporting arms is exporting communism. ... We must do at
least as much for our allies as the Soviets do for theirs.''
   He adds: ``Americans instinctively cringe at the thought of
shipping off tons of weapons and military equipment to countries
around the world; they do not want to think of themselves as arms
merchants. But military aid is often the best way to protect our
interests and those of our friends and allies.''
   The United States, Nixon says, ``must not fall into the trap of
thinking that a reduction in U.S.-Soviet tensions means the end of
the conflict. If (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev stresses the need to solve
his internal problems, we should not be conned into thinking that
the system has changed or that the threat has ended.''
   Gorbachev, the current Soviet leader, Nixon says ``more than his
predecessors is a powerful reminder that we underestimate the
Soviets at our peril.''
   Washington ``lost its collective senses'' when Gorbachev applied
his public relations talents last December at the superpower
summit, the former president writes, saying that Gorbachev ``is so
confident of his strengths that he is not afraid to talk about his
weaknesses.''
   Nixon also makes these points:
   _``In 1999, when we look back over the 20th Century, we will
have to face the fact that mankind's advances in military power and
material progress have dwarfed his progress in developing the
political skills and institutions to preserve peace and capitalize
on our technological advances. It will be our task in the 21st
Century to end the mismatch between our technological skill and our
woefully lagging political skill.''
   _The United States has a greater competitive edge in foreign
economic assistance than in military aid. This country has spent
more than $134 billion in economic aid since World War II compared
with less than $50 billion by the Soviet Union, yet has failed to
capitalize on the advantage.
   _``If we are to compete, it must be on their side of the Iron
Courtain as well as ours. If we compete only on Moscow's terms,
Soviet leaders will take what we give them and come back for more.''
   _Although the United States holds good cards in ideological
competition with the Soviets ``they have done a good job of selling
a poor case and we have done a poor job of selling a good case.''
He writes of ``the pap that passes for programming on the Voice of
America'' and of professional diplomats who ``reflexively treat
disputes as if they were simply great misunderstandings rather than
imsurmountable differences.''
   _The War Powers Act, which limits a president's power to take
military action overseas without congressional approval and was
passed over Nixon's veto in 1973, is not only unconstitutional but
unsound. ``Given the realities of the world, the United States will
sometimes need to use force in actions short of all-out war and
will have to be able to act quickly and decisively. While 535 would
be commanders in chief (the number of representatives and senators)
dissect the merits and demerits of the intervention, the president
will have to keep glancing over his shoulder to check the clock
while fighting to defend American interests.''

<HEAD>Researchers Find Brain Gene That May Relate To Down's Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discovery of a gene that produces a brain
protein from the chromosome segment responsible for Down's syndrome
puts researchers ``on the trail'' of the genetic basis for the most
common form of mental retardation.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, researchers
from Canada and California report that they have identified a brain
protein gene in a part of chromosome 21 that relates to Down's
syndrome, a discovery that other experts said may be an important
first step toward a genetic understanding of the birth defect.
   ``It puts bloodhounds on the trail, but it's still a distant
scent,'' said Dr. David R. Cox of the University of California, San
Francisco, one of seven scientists who conducted the research. He
cautioned that more study is required because ``we don't know what
it's relative importance will be'' in the cause of Down's.
   Dr. Sigfried Pueschel, head of a Down's syndrome research
program at Brown University and a nationally recognized authority,
said the finding is a ``significant advance.''
   ``It is a first step and an important step,'' Pueschel said.
   Down's syndrome is a congenital defect that includes mental
retardation and bowel and heart abnormalities. Down's babies have
broad features and slanted eyes, characteristics that led the
syndrome to once be identified by the now-obsolete term of
``Mongoloidism.''
   Down's syndrome is the most common form of mental retardation.
About 4,000 Down's babies are born annually in the United States.
The syndrome affects one in every 800 to 1,000 live births.
   The birth defect is caused by the presence of three copies of
chromosome 21, instead of the normal pair. It is believed that this
so-called ``trisomy'' leads to the genetic expression of proteins
which in turn lead to the development of Down's.
   In the Science magazine report, Cox said that his
co-investigators found a gene in chromosome 21 that expresses a
protein, called S100, that is primarily found in the brain.
   ``This is the first time that a brain protein has been mapped
into the Down's syndrome region of chromosome 21,'' he said.
``Previously there had been some genes that were expressed
primarily in the brain,'' but those were mapped to other portions
of the chromosome, said Cox.
   ``Our results say that this is a potential candidate gene that
may play a major or minor role in mental retardation,'' he said.
``It can now be studied to test this hypothesis.''
   Cox emphasized that the discovery offers no immediate promise
for treatment and that it will take additional study to determine
the precise effect of the gene.
   ``But it provides the first clue that allows one to start
looking into that,'' he said.
   ``I think to uncover any gene on chromosome 21 with a specific
function is a significant advance,'' Pueschel said. ``It might in
the future provide us with information on how to treat these
individuals.''
   Cox said the researchers isolated portions of chromosome 21 and
then conducted tests to determine which part produced S100. The
gene that expressed the protein was found in a band called 21q22.
It is one of perhaps 1,000 genes in that portion of chromosome 21,
but Cox said it is the first found there that expresses a brain
protein.
   In addition to Cox, members of the research team were Robert
Allore, Karen Neilson, H.F. Willard, R.J. Dunn, David O'Hanlon and
Alexander Marks, all of the University of Toronto in Canada, and
E.R. Price of the University of California, San Francisco.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   A hand grenade exploded Thursday night in an
apartment, injuring three of about a dozen people who had gathered
to watch a pro basketball game on television, police said.
   An unidentified man apparently pulled a pin from a grenade while
the group was watching the Chicago Bulls play the Los Angeles
Lakes, said police Sgt. David Schweiger.
   The blast injured the man who pulled the pin, a teen-ager and a
28-year-old woman, Carolyn Dyson of Chicago, who was hospitalized
in good condition with shrapnel in her eyes, authorities said.
   The man and the teen-ager, whose names were not immediately
available, were listed in serious condition at Loyola University
Medical Center in suburban Maywood, said spokeswoman Carol Prevatt.
   Police didn't know why the man had the grenade, but thought it
was ``either real old or homemade,'' said Schweiger.
   The explosion didn't cause extensive damage to the apartment, he
said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Donald Riegle has returned campaign
contributions made by employees and officers of an Arizona company
on whose behalf he met with federal bank regulators conducting an
investigation.
   Riegle said Thursday he wanted to avoid the appearance of a
conflict of interest and so was giving back $76,100 in
contributions from people associated with American Continental Co.
of Phoenix, Ariz., and its subsidiaries.
   Three other senators present at the meeting last year said
through aides they saw no reason to return the money. An aide to a
fourth senator was unable to say whether the contributions would be
returned.
   ``While there was no conflict of interest involved, before or
after these contributions, even the appearance of such a personal
conflict should be enough to warrant the return of these
contributions, and that is what I have done,'' said Riegle, a
Michigan Democrat up for re-election this year who sits on the
Senate Banking Committee.
   Riegle and Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and John McCain, R-Ariz., met last
April 9 with Federal Home Loan Bank Board examiners and discussed
the investigation of an American Continental subsidiary, Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   There was no connection between the meeting and the agency's
decision to end its probe of high-risk investments made by the
subsidiary, Riegle said last month.
   The meeting was called by DeConcini, said Riegle's press
secretary, Mike Russell. DeConcini had received $43,000 in campaign
contributions from American Continental officers and employees.
   Cranston received $41,900 in contributions; Glenn, $34,000; and
McCain, $112,000.
   ``It is foolishness to assume that just because employees of a
company make a contribution to a DeConcini campaign, that that
company can no longer go to Sen. DeConcini and request the same
kind of constitutent service that any other individual or company
would expect,'' said DeConcini's press secretary, Bob Maynes.
   Aides to McCain and Glenn also said the senators would not
return the contributions because they saw no reason to do so.
   Cranston's press secretary, Victoria Lion, said the senator was
out of the country and she was unable to determine whether he had
or intended to return his American Continental campaign
contributions.
   The contributions were legal under federal election laws.
   Russell said Riegle believed returning the contributions would
put to rest questions about the propriety of his having accepted
the money.
   ``He made a personal decision last weekend,'' Russell said.
``This was the first time in his 22 years of public service that a
conflict of interest had been raised.''

<TEXT>
   Drug and alcohol testing of the nation's
railroad workers is resuming following a court order that has
temporarily boosted Reagan administration efforts to make the
examinations more common.
   The administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, John
Riley, told Congress on Thursday that he had ordered railroads to
begin conducting the urine and blood tests once again, less than a
month after a federal court in San Francisco declared them illegal.
   His order was a response to a stay issued last Friday that
temporarily lifts the ban on testing.
   ``If an accident were to occur tomorrow, the crew would be
tested,'' Riley told the House transportation appropriations
subcommittee.
   Riley said that without last Friday's court ruling, ``our
testing program would be terminated.''
   The Reagan administration has been trying to perform more and
more drug and alcohol tests on employees in the transportation
industry.
   On Feb. 11, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco struck down the FRA's 2-year-old program that required
railroads to check the members of train crews involved in serious
accidents for drug or alcohol use. The court stated that such tests
were unconstitutional unless there was a suspicion that an
individual worker was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
   But last Friday, U.S. Circuit Judge Thomas Tang granted a
request by the government to stay the order until April 2. Tang was
in the 2-1 majority that originally voted to invalidate the testing.
   Riley said that under federal judicial procedures, if the
government files its appeal by April 2 _ which officials say they
will _ the stay would automatically remain in effect until the
Supreme Court issues a decision in the case. That would probably
take months.
   But a spokesman for the country's railroad unions said the stay
would not be automatically extended beyond April 2. Edward Wytkind,
spokesman for the Railway Labor Executives Association, said that
after April 2, the Supreme Court could decide to allow the tests to
resume at any time.
   ``We don't view the stay as any sort of attack on employees,''
Wytkind said. ``It's just on an interim basis.''
   As a result of the decision, the government had also halted drug
and alcohol testing of railroad workers performed for what it
called ``reasonable cause'' in which a supervisor noticed unusual
behavior by a worker.
   Such tests also will be resumed, Riley said.

<HEAD>Barge Storage Cost $45 Million Above Elevator Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The four-month tab for storing Midwest grain
on river barges to help make room in country elevators for the new
1986 harvest came to $62 million, or nearly a dollar a bushel, the
General Accounting Office says.
   Overall, the cost to taxpayers was sharply higher than the
storage fees normally paid by the government for grain inventories
in elevators and farm bins. The program was announced in August
1986 as one of a number of emergency measures to help relieve
pressure on elevators getting ready for another bumper corn harvest.
   The GAO, an investigative agency of Congress, said in a recent
report to Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., that the Agriculture
Department awarded storage contracts to a dozen grain companies. A
total of about 64.9 million bushels of grain _ 98 percent corn and
2 percent soybeans _ was loaded on 1,253 barges along the Illinois,
Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers.
   All of the barge grain originated from the Corn Belt states of
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,
Ohio and Wisconsin, the GAO said. Most had been in country and
terminal elevators in those states, but some had been stored by
producers on their farms.
   Eventually, the department's Kansas City Commodity Office, which
handled the program, disposed of most of the barge grain by trading
it to the contractors for grain they had stored in inland
elevators. The remainder was sold, redeemed by farmers or returned
to storage elsewhere.
   ``We estimate that the additional cost of the special barge
storage program, over and above the normal costs for shipping,
storing and disposing of the grain, was about $44.8 million, or an
additional cost of 69 cents per bushel to store the grain for an
average of four months,'' the GAO said.
   The estimate by GAO was made because the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service ``did not
separately accumulate total cost data for the program.'' However,
GAO said its estimates were based on reviews of contracts and other
information provided by the agency.
   ``The estimated cost of storing the 64.9 million bushels of
grain was about $62.2 million, or 96 cents per bushel,'' the GAO
said. ``This includes the additional cost of the program (about
$44.8 million) and the cost that would have been incurred in the
normal course of storage (more than $17.3 million).''
   Corn market prices nationally averaged $1.73 per bushel when the
program was announced and dropped to $1.40 in October 1986, the
peak of the new harvest.
   Investigators said they estimated the department's Kansas City
Commodity Office paid the 12 contractors about $45.5 million and
that an additional $16.7 million went to others for charges related
to the barge-stored grain.
   The GAO said the Kansas City office ``agreed with our
methodology and results'' in estimating the payments.

   The Agriculture Department's new crackdown on
illegally high traces of a suspected cancer-causing drug found in
hog carcasses has eased concern in Japan that pork imports from the
United States may be tainted, officials said.
   Japan had initiated a program to hold and test all U.S. pork
imports, which American livestock interests feared might jeopardize
foreign sales. The drug involved is sulfamethazine, commonly used
by swine producers to prevent certain kinds of disease and as a
feed additive to promote faster growth.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said Thursday that USDA and Japanese
officials have agreed on testing requirements for pork shipped to
Japan.
   Crawford said Japanese officials ``have been favorably impressed
with U.S. efforts'' initiated on March 7 to increase testing of
pork products for sulfamethazine residues in the 100 largest U.S.
pork plants.
   ``U.S. pork produced after March 7 must carry a statement on the
export certificate that the product originated from one of the 100
plants undergoing increased residue testing,'' he said. ``Japan
will not further test these products for sulfamethazine residues.''
   Pork exported before the new controls went into effect will be
tested further for the drug, either in Japan or the United States,
he said.

   The Agriculture Department reports the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 100,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement between the
two countries.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 100,000 tons of
corn would be about 3.94 million bushels.
   Corn prices recently have been averaging about $1.84 per bushel
at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of
around $7.25 million.
   Officials said Thursday the latest sale involved 50,000 tons
that had been reported by exporters as headed for Japan, and 50,000
tons for ``unknown destinations.''
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 3.27
million tons of corn and more than 6.9 million tons of wheat, plus
1.3 million tons of soybean meal and 813,300 tons of soybeans.

<HEAD>Carlucci Warns of Long Fight Over Covert Action Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress will begin another long fight with
the White House if it passes a bill requiring President Reagan to
tell Capitol Hill about all covert operations within 48 hours after
they start, says Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   Reagan would veto the bill because he believes it is
unconstitutional, the defense secretary said Thursday in testimony
before a House Intelligence subcommittee. He added that enactment
of the measure over Reagan's objection would touch off another
fight similar to the ongoing dispute over the War Powers Act.
   The War Powers Act, a 1973 law restricting a president's
authority to send U.S. troops into dangerous situations, is the
subject of a federal court fight over its constitutionality. The
White House claims it is unconstitutional.
   The intelligence notification bills arise from the Iran-Contra
affair, when U.S. weapons were secretly sold to Iran and some of
the profits were diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas.
Reagan withheld notification from Congress for 10 months in 1986.
   Current laws require that Congress be told about covert actions
except in extraordinary circumstances, when only ``timely notice''
is required. But the phrase is not defined and the proposed
legislation would mandate notice within 48 hours.
   Carlucci, who was Reagan's national security adviser after the
Iran-Contra affair became public, said the administration has put
procedures into place to avoid another Iran-Contra situation.
   ``At some point, we have to rely on trust,'' he told the
legislation subcommittee. ``If a future president sets out to
deceive a Congress, no amount of statutes will stop him.''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the bill is ``one more battle
between the imperial Congress and the imperial presidency.''
   Carlucci agreed, saying, ``I can think of no step by the
Congress which would do more harm to the process of rebuilding an
atmosphere of trust and candor between the branches than
unilaterally to lay claim to prerogatives which the president
firmly believes are vested in the executive by the Constitution.''
   But Rep. Matt McHugh, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee, said
the legislation is needed.
   ``In the case of the arms sales to Iran, the president construed
current law as permitting him to withhold notice for more than 10
months after the covert sales had been authorized,'' McHugh said.
   ``If he had done (as the law generally requires), he would
surely have heard some strong objections and might have spared the
country a serious foreign policy setback and himself a major
political embarrassment.''
   Carlucci's argument was that ``the failures of the Iran affair
were human and managerial. No statute can prevent these mistakes.
... We will not put the mistrust which caused the Iran-Contra
affair behind us until we trust each other again.''
   The bill was also opposed by Brent Scowcroft, national security
adviser to President Ford.
   Scowcroft said ``the excessively restrictive language proposed
seems a case of throwing out the baby with the bath. It is not
possible to eliminate every opportunity for abuse by the executive
without at the same time paralyzing the ability to act.''
   He said the bills arise from the view that notification to
Congress about the arms sales would have been met with opposition
that would have derailed the plan.
   Scowcroft disputed that. ``There is no evidence to support this
assumption. Indeed, as it was, the president was confronted, by his
principal advisers, with views strongly in opposition to the
Iranian arms sales.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush leads Senate GOP
leader Bob Dole by a wide margin among Republicans likely to vote
in Illinois' presidential primary, according to survey results
published today.
   The Washington Post-ABC News telephone poll conducted Wednesday,
six days before the primary election, showed Bush with the support
of 58 percent of 395 likely Republican voters, while Dole, of
Kansas, was backed by 31 percent.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson was the choice of 6
percent while Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who dropped out of the
race on Thursday, had 4 percent, according to the survey, which was
published in today's editions of the Post.
   In the Democratic race, native sons Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois
and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson of Chicago led with 38
percent and 33 percent, respectively, among 402 likely Democratic
voters. The difference between the two was within the poll's margin
of error.
   Massachussets Gov. Michael Dukakis trailed with 16 percent and
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri had 6 percent. Former Sen. Gary
Hart of Colorado, who was expected to withdraw from the contest
today, was picked by 3 percent of the respondents and Sen. Albert
Gore of Tennessee was chosen by 2 percent.
   The newspaper said the survey had a margin of error of plus or
minus eight percentage points.

<HEAD>Robertson Says May Use Matching Funds Even as He Nears Spending
Limit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson, the biggest-spending candidate of
the presidential race so far, says he'll use his federal matching
funds after all, even though he has said he is philosophically
opposed to the idea.
   Robertson said Thursday that ``short of what would amount to an
absolute miracle in the state (of Illinois), it looks as if I'll
have to use them.''
   He also said at a news conference that he is within about $2
million of the $27 million spending cap that election rules set for
those who get matching funds. That could pose serious strategy
problems for him, because it means he will be unable to continue
the kind of high-spending campaign he has conducted so far and will
be forced to skimp along for the remainder of the primary season.
   ``It's going to mean that it's going to be me the candidate and
not a lot of travel and everything else the volunteers,'' he said.
   Robertson said he had made deep cuts in his national staff, but
he declined to give specific numbers. He said the reductions had
cut deeply into his press and office staff.
   ``Everybody is bucking up around the federal (spending) limit
... so we want to stay lean and mean,'' he said.
   Robertson has received $7.2 million in federal matching funds,
more than any other candidate, including Vice President George
Bush, who has received $6.6 million.
   Robertson's campaign has put the money into an escrow account
and was keeping open the option of not using the money and later
giving it back to the government. In that case, campaign attorney
Marion Harrison had contended, Robertson would not be bound by the
spending limits imposed on those who accept matching funds.
   Whether the Federal Election Commission would have accepted that
point of view is now moot since Robertson has indicated he will not
try that approach.
   FEC officials had pointed out that the law requires a candidate
to sign an agreement to abide by the limits at the time of
application for matching funds. There is no language in the
regulations that addresses whether a candidate actually spends the
money.
   Robertson had used the money as collateral for a $5.5 million
loan in January, and a $1.5 million loan in December.
   ``We put the (matching) funds in escrow and borrowed against
them. We're still trying to keep our options open, but the options,
I might say, narrowed considerably after Super Tuesday,'' Robertson
said in an interview following a brief Chicago news conference
kicking off his effort in Illinois.
   Robertson said that the matching funds are, ``in a sense,
already spent.
   ``That money would just go to pay off loans. The truth is, in my
estimation, that all the major campaigns are bumped up against the
limit. There is not much money left for anybody,'' said Robertson.
   ``We're trying to husband our resources as hard as we can and
hold on through June,'' he continued.
   Robertson said cash problems would not deter him from continuing
the GOP fight.
   ``I am more and more being urged by conservatives to stay in the
race as a rallying point for conservatives and conservative
principles,'' he said.
   As of the most recent campaign financial reports, through Jan.
31, Robertson had spent more against the limit than any other
candidate _ more than $22 million. That was before the most
intensive spending period began for the Super Tuesday primaries and
caucuses in 20 states on March 8.
   By contrast, Bush had spent $15.3 million and Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kan., $18.1 million.
   The matching funds are provided from a fund supported by the $1
voluntary checkoff on individual income tax returns. Each donation
of $250 or less that a candidate raises is matched by the public
fund. To qualify initially, a candidate must raise at least
$100,000 across 20 states in contributions of $250 or less.
   Robertson had said he was not in favor of the publicly supported
campaign finance system.

<HEAD>Producers Break Off Talks With Writers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks with movie and television producers
aimed at ending a five-day scriptwriters strike broke down, with no
new meeting scheduled, officials of both sides said.
   The writers and producers were meeting Thursday with a federal
mediator when the producers decided the talks weren't going
anywhere, said Mona Mangan, executive director of the Writers Guild
of America's East Coast unit.
   ``In view of the seriousness of the strike and its impact on the
industry, we had hoped that continued talks might bring us better
results. We deeply regret that the companies do not view these
talks as moving us closer together,'' Ms. Mangan said.
   A spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers, Herb Steinberg, said the scriptwriters' demands were so
unrealistic that ``further talks would be fruitless. ... They're
not even in the same neighborhood in an assessment of the economics
involved.''
   Meanwhile, in New York, two unions representing 100,000 actors
set a March 21 deadline for a strike against makers of TV and radio
commercials.
   Federal mediator Leonard Farrell recessed the scriptwriters
talks subject to his calling another meeting, but no date was
agreed to, Ms. Mangan said.
   Daily Variety, an industry newspaper, reported Thursday that the
guild is preparing interim contracts for independent producers, a
tactic used last summer by the Directors Guild before its contract
with producers ended.
   The strike has yet to have a widespread effect on the motion
picture and television industry, but has delayed the debut of at
least two series and has forced the David Letterman and Johnny
Carson shows into reruns.
   A long strike by the 9,000 writers could affect some movies and
the fall television season, and could shorten the current
television season if producers failed to stock enough scripts or
discover extensive rewriting is needed.
   The union struck Sunday, demanding an increase in residuals from
movies and television shows distributed in foreign countries and
rejecting a producers' offer to reformulate residuals from the
syndication of one-hour TV shows.
   In New York, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation
of Television and Radio Artists announced a March 21 strike
deadline for the American Association of Advertising Agencies and
the Association of National Advertisers.
   Union members, working under a contract extension, voted March 2
to authorize a walkout. The last strike of its kind lasted seven
weeks in 1978-79.
   There was no answer Thursday night at the New York offices of
the American Association of Advertising Agencies.

<HEAD>A Revival of `A Streetcar Named Desire' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with other critics; no PMs planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The complicated relationship between the
ethereal Blanche Du Bois and the earthy Stanley Kowalski in
Tennessee Williams' ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' is one of the most
fascinating in the American theater.
   Blanche, the epitome of neurotic southern gentility, flutters to
her doom at the hands of Stanley, her crude but practical
brother-in-law. It's a destructive flight, one that she resists
until the very end of the play but then accepts almost willingly.
   That strange bond between the two is ignored in the new,
straightforward revival of Williams' classic drama that opened
Thursday at Broadway's Circle in the Square Theater.
   This ``Streetcar'' is riding on one rail _ Blythe Danner's
dangerous, on-the-edge performance as the desperate Blanche. Just
when you think she may veer out of control, Miss Danner takes
charge.
   The actress recites Williams' poetry _ and that's what much of
his dialogue is _ with an intensity that is very moving. She also
can handle the more lurid permutations of the plot, bringing a
conviction to melodramatic moments such as as the story of the
death of her young husband. It's a commanding portrait.
   That conviction is lacking in Aidan Quinn who plays Stanley.
Quinn is an intelligent actor but he's miscast, both physically and
vocally.
   His Stanley is brash rather than brutish, more wise guy than
tough guy. That approach works when he's playing poker with his
pals, but when he comes up against an aggressive Blanche, Quinn
falters.
   Blanche keeps referring to Stanley as ape-like, but Quinn's
characterization is anything but animalistic. He's too boyish and
bears more than a passing resemblance to the young newsboy Blanche
attempts to seduce late in the first act.
   Blanche and Stanley become little more than a bickering couple.
Their lack of electricity doesn't ruin the production, but it does
make this revival a lopsided, unsurprising evening of theater.
   Danner works better with Frank Converse, who projects an innate
decency as Mitch, Stanley's good friend and Blanche's one last
chance. There's a genuine regret about their inability to make
something of their relationship. Equally appealing is Frances
McDormand, a ripe, voluptuous Stella who gamely puts up with
Stanley's crudeness because she loves him.
   Nikos Psacharopoulos, the country's foremost interpreter of
Williams' plays, directs at a leisurely pace. Between scenes, there
are a lot of saxophone moans in the night. Designer John Conklin
spills a French Quarter setting, much of it wrought iron, across
the elongated stage to create an evocative New Orleans apartment.
   The set is tantalizing and so is Miss Danner. She just doesn't
have anyone to go up against.
   In other reviews:
   Frank Rich of The New York Times called the production ``a
staging that may not deface Williams's masterpiece but often
sanitizes it. ...
   ``What is most absent from the evening, and not just in Blanche
and Stanley's showdown, is sex. Miss Danner and Mr. Quinn _ both
fine actors, both erotic figures in other circumstances _ shed no
sparks here.''
   In the Daily News, Howard Kissel writes that the production
lacks ``a sense of an old world decaying, of desire hanging
palpably, urgently in the air. ... Without this tangled undergrowth
of anxiety and nervous longing, the play loses its force.''

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Upholds Convictions in Big Dan's Gang Rape
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecutor who handled the Big Dan's
pool-table rape trial says he hopes a state Supreme Court ruling
affirming the convictions will end the furor touched off by the
case.
   ``It was a worldwide case. Literally the whole world was
watching,'' Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina said
Thursday after the high court affirmed the convictions of four men
in the 1984 trial.
   ``If anything, it has heightened the awareness of rape victims
that they can come forward and testify. They now know that they
should report rapes,'' he said.
   In a pair of unanimous rulings, the Massachusetts Supreme Court
turned aside defense objections on Pina's handling of evidence,
Judge William G. Young's decision to avert television cameras from
the victim and other issues.
   The victim's dramatic account of the barroom rape and the
lengthy televised trial in Superior Court drew national attention
to the working-class neighborhoods of New Bedford, where the attack
occurred, and sparked an intense debate over rape.
   The case also brought agony to New Bedford's large
Portuguese-American community. The six young men charged in the
case were of Portuguese descent, as was the victim.
   The high court upheld the punishments handed out to Daniel
Silvia, John Cordeiro and Victor Raposo, who were sentenced to nine
to 12 years in the state maximum-security prison at Walpole, and
Joseph Vieira, who drew six to eight years. The two other
defendants were acquitted.
   The victim died in a car crash outside Miami in December 1986 at
age 25.
   According to court records, she entered Big Dan's tavern on
March 6, 1983, to buy cigarettes. She ordered a drink, spoke with
another woman and watched a game of pool. When she declined an
offer of a ride from Cordeiro and Raposo, the court said, she was
knocked down, dragged to the pool table and raped.

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 74.09
points in heavy trading today, while the U.S. dollar fell slightly
against the yen.
   Traders said most of the 1.8 billion shares traded involved the
top 10 stocks, prompting concern that investors were again turning
to speculation to fuel the market.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 0.02

   The dollar closed at 127.80 yen, down 0.40 yen from Thursday's

   Stephen Jennings, a salesman for Kleinwort Benson, said trading
today was concentrated in two stocks, Nippon Steel and IHI,
accounting for a half a billion shares.
   ``There is a fear that quality is deteriorating,'' and that much
of today's trading was based on speculation, Jennings said.
   He said investors are now looking toward the U.S. trade figures
to be released later this month.
   Another dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke on

<TEXT>
   Newspapers clamored today for Prince Charles and
other royals to abandon dangerous pursuits after the 39-year-old
heir to the British throne narrowly escaped an avalanche that
killed a close friend.
   ``Charles is the next king .... That means he must be ...
safeguarded, if need be from himself,'' the Daily Mirror admonished
in an editorial.
   It said Charles as well as Prince Andrew and his wife, the
Duchess of York, took ``unnecessary risks.''
   ``The royals have a duty to play it safe,'' the newspaper added.
   Charles' 28-year-old brother, Andrew, was catapaulted off the
deck of the U.S. carrier Nimitz in a jet fighter when he and the
28-year-old duchess visited the United States last week.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, is expecting the
couple's first child in August. She was on a skiing holiday with
Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, 26, and friends at Klosters
in the Swiss Alps when the avalanche occurred Thursday. All are
good skiers.
   Sarah, who fell skiing earlier Thursday and was advised to rest,
was with Diana in a chalet when the avalanche struck.
   Andrew, a Royal Navy helicopter co-pilot in the 1982 Falklands
War and now a helicopter instructor, missed the holiday because of
duties at Portland naval based in southwest England.
   The avalanche killed Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, and injured another
friend of the royals, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson.
   Charles, the lead skier, and the rest of his party managed to
evade the avalanche. He helped rescue the unconscious Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson, both of whose legs were broken, and then helped
free Lindsay's body from under the snow.
   Another tabloid, The Sun, demanded: ``Why was he there?''
   ``Daredevil Charles has a passion for pushing himself to the
limit on the snow. Each time he dons his skis he likes to shake off
his tag of pampered prince and prove he is a real man ... Charles
has consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly
slopes,'' The Sun said.
   Swiss authorities had warned that the area where the royal party
was skiing was prone to avalanches.
   The Sun quoted Alex Broggi, a Klosters ski club owner, as
calling Charles ``incredibly brave.'' Broggi added, ``Many locals
are amazed by the runs he attempts. They wouldn't go anywhere near
them.''
   The Star said in an editorial: ``We don't want our royals to be
wimps ... But advisers who should know better must never again lead
the heir to the throne into such deadly danger.''
   The royals and many of their friends have a pronounced taste for
danger and Charles once asserted: ``If you occasionally live
dangerously it helps you appreciate life.''
   The Daily Mail said: ``The question asked by well-wishers of the
royal family is: Why do so many of them go in for such perilous
sports?'' It urged Queen Elizabeth II to ``ask your offspring, for
the nation's sake, to show just a little more care.''
   Charles' other sports include polo and fox hunting. He has
injured himself several times in falls from his horse at polo.
   His father, Prince Philip, 66, played polo until recently while
the 61-year-old queen is an accomplished horsewoman.
   Princess Anne, 37, the queen's only daughter, goes fox hunting
and occasionally rides in horse races, where accidents are numerous.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Will Campaign Hard In Illinois; Urges Party Unity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says he will
continue to campaign hard in the Illinois primary despite a poll
putting him comfortably ahead of GOP rival Bob Dole.
   ``I'm not going to be out-hustled as we prepare to go the polls
Tuesday in Illinois,'' Bush told a Republican dinner on Thursday
night.
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll published in today's editions of
the Post said Bush led Dole, 58 percent to 31 percent.
   Bush had little to say about major staff cutbacks by the Dole
campaign, coupled with a move by the Dole forces to pull television
spots off the air in the state. Dole campaign sources said the
Kansas senator had talked about the possibility of pulling out of
the race, but had decided to stay in at least through Tuesday's
primary here.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said the vice president's
reaction to reports about Dole was: ``We'll go about our business,
do our job.''
   Dole, reeling from a dismal showing on Super Tuesday, insisted
Thursday night that he was ``not a dropout'' and would continue to
campaign.
   Meanwhile, Bush appealed to more than 700 Republicans at the
Champaign County dinner to help him win the state's primary and the
82 GOP delegates at stake.
   He also urged party factions to prepare to put their differences
aside.
   ``It's important to remember that we are all Republicans,'' said
Bush. ``We shouldn't get so negative we can't close ranks in the
fall.''
   Bush, speaking in one of the nation's top agricultural counties,
said as president he would ask that a world economic summit
scheduled in France focus on agriculture.
   He said he would fight for open markets and fair trade so U.S.
farmers could sell their products abroad.
   Bush said he would not use food ``as a foreign policy weapon''
as the Carter administration did with its 1980 grain embargo, and
he said he would oppose protectionist legislation.
   ``If you protect a textile industry, the first thing to be
retaliated against is American agriculture,'' said Bush.
   Earlier, during an appearance in Chicago, Bush said he was
``tired of being embarrassed'' by scandals surrounding public
officials and unethical behavior by high government officials _
though he named no names.
   He pledged to create a special White House ethics panel and give
it ``a new and specific code of ethics.''
   ``When a congressman goes bad or someone in the executive branch
violates the public trust, it hurts,'' Bush told the Governor's
Club luncheon at the Chicago Hilton. ``I'm tired of being
embarrassed. People at all levels of government should come to
serve, not to profit.''
   Bush has steadfastly refused to critize any Reagan
administration officials, including Attorney General Edwin Meese,
who is under investigation by several grand juries.
   Former top White House aides Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger
have been convicted in court cases involving their lobbying
activities after leaving the administration.
   Bush, asked at a news conference whether he was criticizing the
Reagan administration, said he was not. He added that no one ``has
a higher standard of personal ethics than the president _ always
above any possible conflict of interest.''

   Relief worker Peter Coleridge, released after six
days of questioning by Palestinian gunmen in Lebanon, returned and
said the long-term hostages there must be going through something
``very close to hell.''
   ``It was thoughts of my family which kept me going,'' Coleridge
told a news conference after he was reunited with his wife and
three children at Heathrow Airport on Thursday, two days after his
captors freed him.
   Coleridge, 44, Middle East coordinator of the British charity
and relief organization Oxfam, was seized in Sidon March 3 after
taking photographs at the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp there.
   Also captured was his Syrian aide, Omar Traboulsi, 31. After
daily interrogations, they were both released Tuesday.
   ``I was very much aware that I was arguing for my life,'' said
Coleridge. ``If they were in any way not convinced, it wold not
have turned out as well as it has.''
   ``I developed quite an interesting kind of relationship with
those interrogating me,'' Coleridge said. ``I felt that by the end,
we had reached quite a level of understanding of what my
organization does and the kind of work we get involved in.''
   Coleridge said the ordeal gave him an insight into what other
hostages must be experiencing.
   ``They must be going through something very, very close to hell.
I wouldn't wish it on anyone at all _ and I had only six days of
it.''
   ``I was kept in one room with a blanket and bucket and fed
adequately, although I didn't have much of an appetite,'' he said.
   Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, are known to be
missing in Lebanon after being kidnapped.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest-held hostage. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson
is calling for a 71 percent increase in spending on drug
interdiction and treatment over the 1989 Reagan administration
proposal.
   Jackson released a detailed position paper Thursday saying the
government should spend $6.7 billion to fight drugs, a topic which
has emerged at the top of his list of campaign issues.
   ``It's overrunning our borders, it's undermining our
productivity, it's killing our children, it's corrupting our
government,'' he said at a campaign stop at Wheaton College. ``We
must stop the flow of drugs into our country.''
   His spending program includes increases in the interdiction
budgets of the Justice Department, Customs operations, Coast Guard,
Pentagon, and State Department, and prevention and treatment
programs.
   For treatment, according to Jackson's position paper, he would
spend $1.7 billion, compared to $425 million proposed by President
Reagan.
   Jackson contends the drug issue is a hidden benefit for him in
his presidential campaign, because it strikes a responsive chord
wherever he speaks about it. He said in an interview last week that
the media and political analysts have failed to take note of how
important the drug issue is to the American people.
   Jackson tells his audiences that the drug problem is the
nation's No. 1 threat to national security, killing young people,
corrupting police departments and making banks into partners with
drug kingpins.
   He often asks members of the audience to stand if they know
someone who has died because of drugs, who is in jail because of
drugs, or who has tried drugs.
   Jackson has previously said he had no specific numbers on how to
implement his suggestions to fight drugs. But his new position
paper breaks down totals for each government agency.
   ``It is time to put up the necessary resources to meet this
national security threat head on,'' he said in his statement.
   ``We have 325,000 troops in Europe but only 269 drug enforcement
agents overseas to fight the war on drugs.''
   He would tie U.S. foreign and trade policy to the drug problem,
persuading drug-producing allies to install new anti-drug programs
or face trade and diplomatic penalties. These countries should be
rewarded with crop diversification plans and increased U.S.
training, equipment and material assistance. he said.
   Jackson proposed a Western Hemisphere summit on drugs, and said
``international troops may be needed in countries like Colombia to
deal with the crisis.
   Jackson also would name a Cabinet-level ``drug czar.'' And he
would beef up the border patrol and other agencies to stop drugs at
the border, he said.
   Jackson also proposed a school-based education and prevention
program, led by the secretary of education, and a public awareness
campaign similar to the one that warns people about the danger of
smoking cigarettes.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has asked an appeals
court to overturn a judge's order barring federal regulations that
would cut off funding to family planning clinics that offer
abortions or abortion counseling.
   The administration said it was seeking a reversal from the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in U.S. District Judge Walter Ray
Skinner's March 3 ruling, which declared the regulations
unconstitutional.
   Skinner's ruling was announced the day the new guidelines were
to have taken effect, and forced the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services to order regional offices to suspend enforcing them.
   That order will remain in effect while the appeal is considered,
said HHS spokeswoman Lucy Eddinger.
   In a memo accompanying his ruling, Skinner said the regulations
violated a woman's right to choose to have an abortion and her
First Amendment rights to free speech.
   Federal judges in Colorado and New York had issued temporary
injunctions against the regulations, but Skinner was the first to
rule on their constitutionality, and said his order applied
nationwide.
   He granted an injunction requested by the state of
Massachusetts, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health
Association and 13 other local and national family planning groups.
   About 5 million low- and moderate-income women receive services
at 4,000 clinics nationwide which would have been affected by the
regulations announced last month by HHS Secretary Otis R. Bowen.
   The new rules would have prevented federally funded family
planning programs from providing abortion counseling, abortion
referrals, and engaging in lobbying or legal action to increase the
availability of abortions.
   If a clinic performed abortions, it would have been forced to
maintain separate facilities for each type of patient if it wanted
to continue to receive funding under Title X of the Public Health
Service Act of 1970.

Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japanese banks will ``wait for the time being'' for
overdue interest and principal payments by Panama of $40.6 million
in bonds, a Japanese banking official said today.
   Panama missed Thursday's deadline for the payments owed to an
unspecified number of Japanese commercial banks _ $39.06 million in
principal and $1.56 million in interest, said a Bank of Tokyo
official who insisted on anonymity.
   The Bank of Tokyo, along with Yamaichi Securities Co., are the
lead agents for the 10-year bonds, which Panama issued in March
1978.
   ``We will wait for the time being as the Panamanian side has
recently confirmed it is delaying the payments'' because of a
freeze on Panamanian assets held by U.S. banks, the official said.
   According to Japanese banking sources, Panama earlier told its
Japanese creditors a freeze in U.S. aid money to the country in the
wake of a confrontation between Washington and the military regime
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega would make it difficult to honor the
transaction.
   The United States is attempting to oust Noriega, who has been
indicted in Florida on drug trafficking charges.

<HEAD>Doctors Call For More Humane Circumcisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors continue to perform ``archaic''
circumcisions on newborn males, forsaking anesthetics because of
misguided notions that their tiny patients do not feel pain, a new
study concludes.
   Dr. Howard Stang, a Minneapolis pediatrician, said the findings
were not new, ``but the most important thing is this _ if it's
going to be done, it ought to be done humanely.''
   About 3{ million children, roughly half of them males, are born
in the United States each year.
   Stang and four colleagues, whose study was reported in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association, estimate that between
60 percent and 80 percent of the male infants are circumcised
within days of their births _ and that virtually all of those
children are circumcised without anesthesia.
   ``Years and years ago, there was a feeling in the (medical)
community that infants don't suffer,'' Stang said. ``We now know
that just isn't true. As pediatricians, we're trying to get this
across to the obstetricians and family practitioners who handle the
bulk of these surgeries.
   ``I guess it's custom, and customs die hard,'' he added in a
telephone interview. ``The sad thing is that the law requires
animals, for example, to have anesthesia before surgery, but we
don't extend that same humanity to our own kids.''
   In the study, 60 newborns who were to be circumcised were
randomly divided into three groups of 20 each.
   The first group received lidocaine as a local anesthetic in a
10-year-old procedure known as a dorsal penile block. The second
group also received an injection, but the solution was a placebo.
The third group received no injections.
   Researchers found newborns in the lidocaine group cried 23
percent of the time, while babies in the saline and control groups
cried 68 percent and 71 percent of the time, respectively, during
circumcision.
   Additionally, the study measured how the surgery affected blood
levels of cortisol, a chemical secreted by the adrenal gland that
shows how much stress the individual is under.
   The infants given lidocaine showed significantly lower levels
throughout the surgery, said Stang.
   Stang noted that during the circumcisions of Jewish children,
infants are given wine as a general anesthetic.
   ``That's a start,'' he said, ``but a local anesthetic is better
because it's more easily controlled and there are no complications.
   ``Using the block has been proven to be safe,'' he said, ``but
what will make it commonplace is for parents to demand that their
doctors do it.''
   Stang said doctors also may be resisting the procedure because
they fear a lack of complications may lead to an increasing number
of circumcisions.
   He said the current rate has held steady since 1970, when both
the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of
Obstetrics and Gynecology issued statements that circumcision has
no medical value.
   Since then, some insurance companies have classified the surgery
as cosmetic and will not reimburse clients.
   ``But some new studies may be shifting the tide back,'' Stang
said. He said there are indications that uncircumcised males may be
more prone to urinary tract infections.

<TEXT>
   An earthquake that shook most of
Costa Rica swayed tall buildings in the capital and sent people
fleeing from their homes as windows shattered in southern cities,
authorities said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries in Thursday night's
quake, which was centered near the Panamanian border.
   The quake occurred at 9:46 p.m. and registered 5.6 on the
Richter scale, said a San Jose's fire official, adding that it was
centered near Buenos Aires _ 70 miles southeast of the capital and
26 miles from Panama.
   ``The glass windows of many homes broke in the towns of Buenos
Aires, Ciudad Neily and San Isidro,'' said the official, who
refused to be further identified. San Isidro is 48 miles southeast
of San Jose. Ciudad Neily is seven miles from the Panamanian border.
   Firefighters in the Panamanian city of David said the tremor was
felt strongly in the western border provinces of Chiriqui and Boca
del Toro, but there were no reports of damage or injuries.
   The temblor was not felt in Panama City.
   ``The people ran into the streets terrified in the cities of
Buenos Aires and Ciudad Neily,'' Johnny Zamora of the Red Cross in
San Jose said.
   In San Jose, tall buildings swayed.
   ``Definitely the quake was felt practically in all the
country,'' the fire official said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number indicates an increase of
10 times in ground motion.
   An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage. One
measuring 6 can cause severe damage, while a reading of 8 indicates
a quake capable of tremendous damage.

   Former President Jimmy Carter says this
year's Democratic National Convention will help produce a strong
presidential ticket, unlike recent ``circus'' atmosphere
conventions that weakened the nominee.
   Carter, who spent Thursday at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy as a
Hedrick Fellow, said he emerged from both conventions that
nominated him for president ``weaker than I went in'' because too
many delegates used the occasions as platforms for their own issues.
   ``Democratic conventions were a circus,'' he said at a news
conference after conducting an informal class for cadets majoring
in international relations and government.
   ``We had nominees wounded and bleeding,'' he said, praising the
current party leadership for ``making sure delegates are committed
to winning _ not just highlighting their own individual causes.''
   Carter said he can't tell who will prevail at the convention,
but it will be difficult for any candidate to get 50 percent of the
delegates on the first ballot.
   ``I've got an open mind about it,'' he said. ``What happens
during the campaign will be an indication of who will do well in
November when they run against George Bush.''

   Secret Service agents and Chicago police struggled for more than
45 minutes Thursday to open a burgundy Cadillac inside which a

   While the agents and police worked on the parked car, Gephardt
was taken to a nearby office where he had to fend off reporters
asking whether his campaign had run out of gas.
   ``We're campaigning as hard as we can in Illinois, in Michigan
and in all the other states,'' he said.
   Gephardt, eventually taken away in a second car, declined to

<HEAD>GOP Officials Say Washington Caucus Results Skewed By Human Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three days after Super Tuesday, Republican
officials say human error skewed the reported results of Washington
state's precinct-level GOP caucuses, but not enough to change the
order of finish that put Pat Robertson on top.
   Robertson won 39 percent of the Republican delegates picked
Tuesday night to attend county or legislative district conventions
where another slate of delegates will be picked for the state
convention. Sen. Bob Dole won 26 percent and Vice President George
Bush, 24 percent.
   John Meyers, executive director of the state GOP, said reporting
errors occurred when precinct caucus results were phoned in to the
News Election Service, and that these errors first were noted by
the Dole campaign.
   Meyers said most involved precinct chairmen reporting straw vote
totals rather than the number of pledged delegates they would send
to their next convention. Others reported delegates and alternates
together, he said.
   ``The mistakes weren't enough to change the overall results,''
Meyers said. ``When you've got almost 4,000 precincts some mistakes
are going to be made.''
   The result was that NES reported more delegates committed than
possible for the 71 percent sample of Tuesday night. Some precincts
didn't report.
   Vance noted that it would be the July 15 state convention when
delegates would be allocated and until then, ``no one won here on
Super Tuesday.''

<HEAD>Cuomo Says His Chance to Run for President is Gone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is repeating his
pledge not to run for president and calling on Democratic
candidates to support the man who takes the most delegates into the
convention.
   ``Whoever it is, make him the candidate,'' Cuomo said Thursday.
``If Mike Dukakis has 41 percent, get everybody together in a room
and say, `Jesse, Gore, Gephardt, you came close, but Mike's the
candidate.'
   ``Why is 51 percent the magic number? Let's pick the guy who's
ahead after California,'' Cuomo said at a news conference in his
Manhattan office.
   During a visit to Long Island earlier Thursday, the governor
said he won't run for president this year because of a promise he
made when he ran for re-election in 1986.
   He also shot down any ideas of drafting him at the Democratic
convention in July, saying leaving that option open would be
divisive.
   ``You're saying, `But then there's no role for you, governor.'
That's right. I shouldn't be part of it,'' Cuomo said at the World
Trade Center. ``I should've been in the primaries like everybody
else if I wanted it.''
   Cuomo said he has probably missed his chance to become president.
   ``Since I can't be a candidate this year,'' Cuomo reasoned,
``and the Democrats are going to win for sure, the Democrats will
be in office for eight years. That's the end of Cuomo.''

<TEXT>
   Fifty union activists demanding
higher pay and reinstatement of fired workers occupied the Interior
Ministry for nine tense hours, then left the police-ringed building
under church protection.
   The Roman Catholic church was able to mediate the evacuation
Thursday after a judge inspected the building and confirmed the
workers were neither armed nor holding hostages, said Monsignor
Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the metropolitan auxiliary bishop.
   The Workers Solidary Coordinate protesters were unable to win
any concessions and took a bus, under military escort, to a local
church office for the night.
   Officials with the National Salvadoran Workers Unity, the
largest opposition union, said soldiers captured and beat their
leader, Humberto Centeno, when he arrived to seek an end to the
occupation.
   Both unions are leading opponents of the government of President
Jose Napoleon Duarte, who claimed the ministry takeover was part of
a recently-discovered guerrilla plan to stir up mass protests in
the country.
   The 50 unionists took over the building to demand a $60 monthly
wage hike, reinstatement of dismissed workers and other conditions.
They spoke with Labor Minister Lazaro Tadeo Bernal, but he gave
them no satisfaction, said Gerardo Diaz Henriquez, the Coordinate's
director.
   Centeno had arrived on a bus with several other union activists,
who soldiers forced back onto the vehicle before shooting out its
window, said Guillermo Rojas, a Workers Unity official.
   One worker was injured by flying glass, he said.
   Duarte, at a news conference with Bernal, said the government
did not talk with the protesters, who he said would be jailed if
captured.
   The president said the incident confirmed the existence of a
rebel plan to widen the scopeof its leftist insurgency by having
urban-based mass organizations engage in disruptive activity.
   The government has said the plan calls for constructing
barricades, occupying public buildings, provoking riot police and
burning buses and other government vehicles.

   A Soviet envoy rejected a U.S. demand that Moscow
cut off military aid to Afghanistan if Washington stops aiding
Afghan rebels after a Soviet troop pullout.
   Moscow's ties to Afghanistan are seven decades old and the U.S.
demand is tantamount to the Soviets calling for an end to U.S. aid
to Pakistan, said Nikolay Kozyrev, ambassador-at-large and senior
Soviet specialist in Asian affairs.
   Kozyrev, who spoke to reporters at a news conference Thursday,
heads a visiting team of Soviet specialists to follow the latest
round of the peace talks in Geneva between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
   U.N. Undersecretary-General Diego Cordovez is mediating the
6-year-old peace talks, the latest round of which began March 2.
   Pakistan is representing Afghan guerrillas who have been
fighting for nine years against the government in Kabul, the Afghan
capital. Soviet troops were sent into Afghanistan in 1979 to prop
up the Marxist government.
   Robert Peck, assistant deputy Secretary of State, is also in
Geneva to follow the talks and has been in touch with Kozyrev. A
U.S. Mission spokesman said Peck had no immediate comment on the
Soviet's comments.
   The United States has given the Afghan rebels millions of
dollars in aid, including ground-to-air Stinger missiles claimed to
have downed more than 200 Soviet and Afghan aircraft.
   Kozyrev said the talks ``bogged down'' of Pakistan's insistence
that an interim government replace the one headed by Soviet-backed
President Najib.
   He said Islamabad will bear the responsibility if there is no
final agreement despite completion of all main elements of the
``peace package.''
   The interim government, Pakistan argues, could guarantee
implementation of the settlement and ensure the safe return of more
than 5 million Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran.
   Kozyrev said the draft agreements from the peace talks do not
commit his country to halt aid to the Kabul government, except to
stipulate that no new troops must be sent to Afghanistan after the
withdrawal of the estimated 115,000-strong ``limited Soviet
contingent.''
   Kozryev avoided a direct answer when asked whether negotiations
would continue after next Tuesday, the target date set by Mikhail
Gorbachev last month. The Soviet leader said that Moscow will begin
the troop withdrawal May 15 if the settlement is signed by March 15.
   Sources close to the talks said the date was not considered a
deadline after which the Kabul representatives would walk out.
   The U.S. demand for ``symmetrical cessation'' of military aid
was spelled out at a State Department briefing on March 4. It was
the latest of seemingly uncoordinated signals from Washington
concerning the issue.
   It followed a non-binding resolution, unanimously adopted by the
U.S. Senate last week, urging the White House to continue such aid
until all Soviet troops have left.
   Peck said before his departure from Washington that a decision
on the timing of the cut-off should be left to President Reagan.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Demands Truth About Wartime Massacre of Polish Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a dramatic speech in parliament, an
independent deputy demanded the truth be told about the World War
II massacre of 4,000 Polish officers in a forest in the Soviet
Union.
   The official version is that Nazi troops committed the Katyn
forest massacre, but many Poles blame the Soviet Union.
   Deputy Ryszard Bender, raising the taboo issue for the first
time in parliament, said Thursday that full disclosure is needed if
Poland and the Soviet Union are to have genuinely friendly
relations.
   ``The word `Katyn' must be spoken out in this high chamber,''
said Bender, addressing Foreign Minister Marian Orzechowski. ``This
is required by the honor of the Polish people, by its martyrdom
throughout'' the war.
   Bender spoke after Orzechowski praised a Soviet-Polish agreement
on ideological cooperation signed last year that stresses the need
for a more truthful history of Polish-Soviet relations.
   Bender said Soviet interests were not served by ``making Poland
a dependent nation'' but by having ``a sovereign, self-governing,
economically strong Poland'' as its neighbor.
   He said the friendly relations between Poland and the Soviet
Union ``must be genuine ... Not just facade-like propaganda.''
   On Tuesday, 59 Polish opposition activists and intellectuals,
including Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, issued an open letter
appealing to Soviet intellectuals to speak out about Katyn.
   Bender called on Communist authorities to open up to historians
archives of classified documents so ``blank spots'' in
Polish-Soviet relations can be filled. He said these included the
1939 non-aggression pact through which the Soviet Union and Germany
divided Poland.
   That September, the Nazis invaded from the west and the Soviets
from the east. Tens of thousands of Poles were deported to Siberia.
   ``There are persons in this chamber with painful experiences of
those deportations,'' said Bender.
   The phrase ``blank spots'' has become shorthand in Poland for
topics so controversial that go unmentioned or are distorted in
official histories.
   Last week, a joint Soviet-Polish commission of Communist party
historians met in Warsaw to review research on the ``blank spots.''
   The panel discussed such sensitive topics as the fate of Poles
deported to the Soviet Union in 1939-41, but reported no progress
in elucidating all the circumstances behind the Katyn massacre.
   Polish and Soviet official versions of the massacre say the
4,000 officers whose bodies were found in the forest near Smolensk
were murdered by the Nazis in 1941 after they invaded the Soviet
Union.
   Most Poles and Western historians maintain the officers were
slain in 1940 on orders of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   The 4,000 were among 15,000 Polish officers detained after the
Soviets invaded Poland and held in three separate camps in western
Russia. The fate of the remaining 11,000 officers has never been
revealed, and the issue remains a sensitive point in Polish-Soviet
relations.
   In his speech, Orzechowski said the ideological cooperation
agreement ``will be conducive to overcoming the negative phenomena
which have accumulated in history'' between two countries.
   He said Poland fully supported the ``revolutionary changes''
being introduced by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, adding that
Polish-Soviet relations are ``closer than ever before.''

   Peace Corps officials they're anxious to begin

nation.
   Arlen Erdahl, directing of recruiting for the Peace Corps, said
Thursday that applicants started phoning the corps within hours of

Peace Corps volunteers.
   Though the concentration is likely to be on English teachers,
China still must decide what special skills it wants the volunteers

<HEAD>Marine Linked With Soviet Embassy Sex-Spy Case Leaving Service</HEAD>

   Cpl. Arnold Bracy, a Marine embassy guard who
for a time figured prominently in last year's Moscow spy scandal is
leaving the military next month, and a source said he would be
honorably discharged.
   The Marine Corps announced Thursday that Bracy, 22, of Woodside
Queens, New York City, will be formally discharged on April 4. A
Marine official who asked not to be named said Bracy would receive
an honorable discharge.
   Bracy served as an embassy guard in Moscow with Sgt. Clayton J.
Lonetree, 26, who was convicted last August of passing classified
information to Soviet agents after becoming involved with a Russian
woman.
   For a time last spring, Bracy also faced a military
court-martial because Navy and federal agents were convinced he had
conspired with Lonetree and allowed Russian KGB agents inside the
embassy late at night to roam at will.
   Those allegations were based in part on a confession signed by
Bracy after a lengthy interrogation. Bracy later recanted that
statement, saying it had been coerced, and all charges against him
were dropped when military lawyers concluded they did not have any
corroborating evidence to prosecute.

budgeted for that purpose is diverted to pay for an unmanned
scientific and manufacturing facility in space.
   Andrew Stofan told a House subcommittee Thursday he would oppose
any attempt to take money from the space station budget to pay for

Congress will ``kiss goodbye to the space station.''
   Boland's subcommittee handles financing for housing programs as

<HEAD>Witnesses Testify About Poor Work At Clinical Laboratories</HEAD>

   The chairman of a House subcommittee says
fraud, overcharging and kickbacks are rampant among clinical
laboratories, and witnesses at a hearing called for better federal
oversight.
   Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who chairs the House
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations,
said at a hearing Thursday that problems are ``rampant in this
industry and federal oversight has been non-existent.''
   Witnesses at the hearing said unregulated laboratory procedures
have resulted in problems such as a 20 to 40 percent error rate in
Pap tests used to detect cervical cancer in women.
   Other problems include piecework pay systems that encourage
production at the expense of careful diagnosis and pressure to
accept inadequate specimens and call them negative so doctors won't
send their business elsewhere, said Shirley Greening, representing
the American Society for Cytotechnology.
   She and others recommended mandatory proficiency testing for all
diagnostic lab technicians, workload limits, more federal money to
monitor labs through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and
required public disclosure of lab caseload volume, staffing, fees,
quality control methods and results.

<HEAD>Falwell: TV Ministry Scandals Will Strengthen Evangelism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell says scandals
involving TV preachers Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart have
strengthened broadcast evangelism and made Christianity stronger,
more mature and more committed.
   Christian television ministries that put their financial and
doctrinal houses in order will survive and prosoper, Falwell told
the National Association of Evangelicals on Thursday.
   In five years, ``most of the evangelical ministers that are
playing on top of the table will be stronger than they are today,''
the fundamentalist preacher said in his first appearance before the
group, which represents 50,000 churches in 72 denominations.
Falwell is not a member of the NAE.
   ``You need not be embarrassed by what has happened ... just more
sensitive,'' he told hundreds of applauding delegates. ``This is a
time to regroup, judge ourselves and march on with a greater
intensity than before.
   ``The cause of Christ is now better off'' because of Bakker and
Swaggart's problems, Falwell said, comparing the scandals with
Watergate and politics.
   ``In the days ahead, it is going to be tougher for national
leaders (of TV ministries) to misbehave,'' just as the Watergate
crisis resulted in governmental and political reforms, he said.
   Bakker, who admitted a tryst with a church secretary and who has
been accused of financial improprieties, was expelled from the
Assemblies of God church. After Bakker resigned as head of PTL,
Falwell headed the ministry for several months before stepping
aside.
   Swaggart, who has been accused of paying a prostitute to perform
lewd acts, was suspended by the denomination and expects to return
to the pulpit.
   The scandals have led to a new code of moral and financial
ethics for religious broadcasters.
   ``I think the days of the Rolls Royces and Rolexes ... the days
in which social status is gauged by financial trappings are over,''
said Falwell, whose ``Old Time Gospel Hour'' is broadcast worldwide
on 350 television stations.
   He said the Swaggart controversy had little effect on his own
ministry, and he didn't believe that it had the more serious impact
of the Bakker revelations on the religious broadcast industry.
   However, he said that if the events surrounding Swaggart and
Bakker had involved him, Billy Graham or other more conservative
ministers ``we would be out looking for other employment.''
   ``I'd rather be dead'' than be immoral, said Falwell, a founder
of the Moral Majority and pastor of the 21,000-member Thomas Road
Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va.
   Falwell praised former television evangelist Pat Robertson, but
said he endorsed Vice President George Bush for the presidency even
though Falwell advised President Reagan not choose Bush as his vice
president.
   The preacher said he would like to see U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp run
for vice president. The Republican New York congressman pulled out
of the presidential race Thursday after a poor showing in primary
and caucus races.
   Falwell is a registered Democrat, but said, ``I can't think of a
single Democrat running this year who I could hold my nose and vote
for.''

   The dollar fell against other major foreign
currencies in Europe early today in moderately active trading. Gold
bullion rose.
   A trader in Frankfurt, West Germany, said market participants
were limiting dollar exposure ahead of the weekend.
   The British pound, whose value leaped by 4 percent against the
dollar this week, gained further ground on the U.S. currency,
trading at $1.8465, up from $1.8435 late Thursday.
   But traders said the rally appeared to be running out of steam
on a statement by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson on
Thursday that sterling would be unable to sustain a further advance.
   Other midmorning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday:
   _1.6620 West German marks, down from 1.6640
   _1.3740 Swiss francs, down from 1.3785
   _5.6665 French francs, down from 5.6725
   _1.8683 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8720
   _1,235.00 Italian lire, down from 1,236.63
   _1.2560 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2564
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 127.80 Japanese yen, down from
Thursday's close of 128.20 yen. In later London trading Friday, the
dollar slipped to 127.45 yen.
   London's major bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price of
$444.10 a troy ounce at midmorning, up from $443 late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $444.15, up from $442.50.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $445.48
dollars, up from $438.42.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid of $6.31 a troy
ounce, down from $6.36.

<TEXT>
   Glenn Cunningham, who overcame a crippling
childhood injury to become America's premier middle distance runner
in the 1930s, is dead at age 78.
   Cunningham died Thursday at his exotic animal preserve near
Menifee, which he maintained as a retreat for troubled youngsters.
   ``As long as you believe you can do things, they're not
impossible,'' Cunningham said in an interview 10 years ago. ``You
place limits on yourself mentally, not physically.
   ``People say something's never been done, so it can't be done.
But that's not so. It's never been done because no one has set
about the task of doing it.''
   Cunningham's greatest task was to walk after the severe injuries
he received in a 1917 schoolhouse fire that killed his older
brother, Floyd. Doctors feared the extensive damage to the
7-year-old Cunningham's legs might require amputation and surely
would prevent him from walking.
   Cunningham proved them wrong. Not only did he walk, he ran as
fast as any miler of his generation, persevering through almost
constant pain.
   ``I was 179 pounds, too heavy for a runner,'' he recalled a few
years ago. ``I also had broken-down arches, bad legs and such badly
abscessed teeth _ eight of them _ that doctors didn't see how I
could walk. I never knew when my teeth would cause me great pain.
But I just knew I could do it _ run and win.''
   He set a world outdoor record of 4 minutes, 6.7 seconds in the
mile at Princeton, N.J., in 1938. His indoor best of 4:04.4 wasn't
recognized as a record because it was considered a paced race, a
practice which became acceptable only after Cunningham had retired.
   Cunningham, a native of Elkhart, Kan., who later attended Kansas
University ran the 1,500 in two Olympics, finishing fourth in the
1932 Games at Los Angeles and winning the silver medal in the 1936
Games at Berlin.
   Cunningham six times won the prestigious Wanamaker Mile in the
indoor Millrose Games at New York. He won it the first time in
1933, the year he was voted the Sullivan Award as the best amateur
athlete in the United States.
   He won 21 of his 31 races at Madison Square Garden, set six
world records at 1,500 meters or one mile and another at 1,000
yards.
   In 1979, Cunningham was voted best track athlete in the 100-year
history of Madison Square Garden, and on Feb. 28 returned to the
Millrose Games to run a lap during a commemorative ceremony.
   After a tour with the Navy in World War II, Cunningham and his
wife, Ruth, bought an 840-acre ranch near Wichita, Kan. Cunningham
tended exotic animals and he and his wife cared for any wayward or
troubled child sent his way.
   ``We have worked 18 hours a day, seven days a week, to
rehabilitate 9,000 wayward or orphaned youths who passed through
our care,'' said Cunningham, who had 12 children of his own.
   Funeral arrangments were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a key
figure in the Iran-Contra scandal, denied any knowledge of an
alleged Reagan administration plot to infiltrate the organizations
of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   Secord said Thursday he was relaying a message from an associate
when, in a memo to former National Security Council aide Oliver
North, he mentioned an apparent effort to collect information
against LaRouche.
   Secord, a principal in North's private Contra supply network,
said in a telephone interview that he was not aware of any
government plot to infiltrate LaRouche organizations.
   Defense lawyers for LaRouche and his supporters, on trial here
on fraud and conspiracy charges, contend LaRouche was a target of
the FBI and CIA. They cite the North-Secord memo and other
documents as support for the claim.
   The defense lawyers contend that North, the Marine lieutenant
colonel fired for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal, supported
the CIA and FBI infiltration as part of a Reagan administration
plot to ruin LaRouche because he opposed aid to the Contra rebels
in Nicaragua.
   In addition to the Secord-North memo, LaRouche defense lawyers
have been given an FBI document, declassified Wednesday, that
quotes three intelligence operatives as saying they were directed
by top FBI and CIA officials to infiltrate LaRouche groups.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton halted trial testimony this
week because of the newly discovered documents.
   He ordered Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham to review
classified FBI files from which the declassified material was taken
and determine if additional information should be given to defense
lawyers.
   In a May 1986 memo to North that was declassified this week,
Secord said he was told by ``our man here'' that retired Army Sgt.
Maj. Fred Lewis ``has collected info against LaRouche.''
   Defense lawyers have said the prosecutor in the case told them
``our man'' referred to FBI executive assistant director Oliver
Revell. But Secord said he was referring to John Cupp, who worked
for a company that provided clandestine air transport for
government operations, including the Contra resupply effort.
   Cupp on Thursday agreed with Secord's characterization that
``our man'' referred to him, but defense lawyers maintained their
position that the reference was to Revell.
   Cupp said he had relayed to Secord details of a conversation he
had with Lewis, whom Cupp described as a longtime friend.
   ``Fred came to me and said he had been approached by Mr.
LaRouche to conduct some very questionable activities and he kind
of went along with it to get information because he thought he was
a Froot Loop,'' Cupp said in a telephone interview.
   ``He knew I was working in Washington and looked me up because
he thought I would be able to get the information to an authority
who would be able to take some kind of action,'' Cupp said.
   Cupp said Lewis told him that LaRouche wanted to rescue
dissidents from the Soviet Union, including Andrei Sakharov and his
wife, Yelena Bonner.
   ``Lewis hung around for a while to check him out and see what he
was doing but he wasn't doing anything official,'' Cupp said.
   Cupp said he agreed to discuss the matter as a favor to Secord.
   The three operatives quoted in the declassified FBI material are
Lewis, Gary Howard and Ron Tucker.
   LaRouche, six aides and five LaRouche political organizations
are charged with conspiring to obstruct a grand jury investigation
of alleged credit card and loan fraud by LaRouche followers during
his 1984 presidential campaign. Four of the organizations also are
charged with fraud.
   Defense attorneys claim evidence of the fraud was fabricated by
FBI and CIA plants in the organizations.

   A powerful storm system centered near the Nebraska-Wyoming line
churned up snow and wind from the western Dakotas across western
Nebraska and much of Wyoming and Colorado today.
   Blizzard warnings continued today in eastern Wyoming and were
issued today for northeast Colorado, northwest Nebraska and western
South Dakota.
   Many roads were closed in central and eastern Wyoming, where up
to a foot of snow was on the ground, winds of 20 to 40 mph gusted
to around 50 mph, visibility was near zero at times, and subzero
wind chills were reported.
   In Nebraska, the blizzard buffeted Kimball, Alliance, Chadron
and Sidney, with snow totals ranging to 8 inches southwest of
Scottsbluff and up to a foot near the Wyoming state line.
   In western South Dakota, there were 10 inches of snow on the
ground in Deadwood. More than 18 inches of snow was expected in the
Black Hills by tonight, and 4 to 8 inches elsewhere in western
South Dakota.
   The high country of Colorado and Utah also received heavy snow,
including up to 3 feet Thursday at elevations above 6,500 feet in
Utah.
   The storm system was expected to move east, spreading snow
across much of the northern half of the Plains. Its effects,
however, were felt as far west as Southern California, where
northerly winds of 25 to 35 mph and gusts to 45 mph occurred in
higher elevations.
   Elsewhere, a few snow showers lingered in the mountains of
Montana and Idaho. Rain extended from eastern North Dakota into
northwest Minnesota, with snow over northeast Minnesota.
   Dry weather prevailed east of the Mississippi River, across the
southern third of the country, and west of the Rockies.
   Late night temperatures were mostly in the teens and 20s over
the northern and central Rockies and northern Nevada. Readings in
the 20s were also common in the northern and central High Plains,
and from the lower Great Lakes across the northern and central
Appalachians.
   Today's forecast called for strong winds and locally heavy snow
across the northern Plains and Minnesota. Strong, gusty winds also
were expected in the Texas Panhandle and the lower and middle
Mississippi Valley. Snow showers should linger over the northern
and central Rockies, and scattered snow was predicted in northern
Wisconsin and upper Michigan.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 40s, 50s or 60s, except
for 20s and 30s from the northern and central Rockies across the
northern Plains into upper Michigan, and in western and upstate New
York and northern New England. Temperatures should reach the 70s in
the lower Mississippi Valley, Alabama, Florida and the Southwest
deserts, and 70s and 80s across much of the southern Plains.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 11 at
Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 67 at Laredo, Texas, and Key West, Fla.

   San Juan Capistrano, which welcomes
migrating swallows every year, has some competition from another
Southern California city, but the winged creatures returning here
buzz instead of flap.
   The city Advisory Council recently proclaimed April 1 the ``80th
Anniversary of the Day the Flies Return to Yucaipa,'' according to
Chairman Burrell Woodring.
   In San Juan Capistrano, the swallows are greeted as they return
to an old Spanish mission. In this city about 75 miles east of
downtown Los Angeles, some people have suggested an April Fools Day
welcoming ceremony for the flies at an old dump.
   Many blame chicken and horse ranches for attracting the pesky
insects, which make their comeback as spring temperatures rise.
   ``I think I'd rather have the swallows,'' said council member
Gary Pitts, who also sits on the San Bernardino County Fly
Abatement and Appeals Board. ``You open your door and you're
inundated.''

   Henry Miller's typescript of ``Tropic of
Cancer'' sold for $165,000, so aspiring author Alan Rosenberg
figures a manuscript of his new novel should fetch at least $2.75.
   Rosenberg's 415-page bound manuscript of ``Run Red Riding Hood
Run'' is one of 17 items to be placed on the block next month at a
New York auction billed as ``the first futures market in literary
memorabilia.''
   Acknowledging that authors whose memorabilia are considered
worthy of sale are already famous and usually dead, the 34-year-old
Portland writer said Thursday an investment in a Rosenberg memento
would give potential buyers ``a chance to get in on the ground
floor.''
   The items to be offered for auction April 7 include Rosenberg's
dog-eared dictionary, photos and letters, tapes of his dictated
notes, manuscripts of two previous, unpublished books _ and 30
rejection letters from publishers.
   Bids for all items open at $2.75, except for the portable
computer on which he wrote his latest work, Rosenberg said.
   The author, who hired a New York publicist and an auctioneer
specializing in rare books and manuscripts, admits the event is
intended to draw publishers' attention to his new novel.
   ``I don't expect to make enough here to cover my costs,'' the
author said. ``I do expect to make a point. It's tough to break in,
no matter how much talent, determination and patience you have.''

   Organizers of this Mississippi River
city's annual barbecue contest say it's time the cookoff was
officially titled the world's largest, and they're going whole hog
for the billing.
   The May 12-14 competition is called the World Championship
Barbecue Contest, but that title has no independent verfication.
   The National Pork Producers Council is mounting a cooking
contest June 12 in Des Moines, Iowa, and is seeking a nod from the
Guinness Book of World Records for the most pork barbecue cooked in
a day, said Ida Eleazer, a program director for the Memphis in May
festival.
   The pork producers hope to attract 300 cooking teams and crank
out 20,000 pounds of pork barbecue, she said.
   ``I guess we've been challenged,'' said Becky Landers, an
organizer of Memphis' cookoff.
   In an informal survey two years ago, the Memphis barbecuers
cooked 75,000 pounds of pork in two days, Ms. Landers said.
   This year, participants will be required to keep records of how
much pork they cook.
   ``We never really felt like it was an issue before. We knew we
were the largest barbecue contest in the world,'' Ms. Landers said.

   Defense attorneys expressed disbelief after
a judge convicted two 13-year-old girls of being accessories in the
death of a 12-year-old boy forced to drink lighter fluid and
suffocated with a plastic bag.
   Montgomery County Juvenile Court Judge Arthur O. Fisher on
Thursday found the girls guilty of involuntary manslaughter and
grand theft because they helped two 15-year-old boys get into the
apartment of victim Antonio R. Cooley.
   ``I had never envisioned her as anything but a material
witness,'' defense attorney Daniel O'Brien said of his client,
whose name, like that of the other youngsters in the case, was not
released because of their age.
   Attorney Risa McCray, who represented the second girl, said
Fisher ignored the girls' claims they tried to warn the victim and
testimony by a 13-year-old boy backing them up.
   ``He even ignored the state's own evidence,'' Ms. McCray said.
   The defense attorneys contended the 13-year-old boy kept the
girls in a back room while two older boys killed Cooley Feb. 8.
   O'Brien said the two older boys had threatened the girls with
harm even while in the county detention center.
   Cooley was sprayed with insecticide and forced to drink charcoal
lighter fluid before being suffocated with a plastic bag, according
to a deputy coroner.
   Fisher said the girls did nothing to alert authorities, although
they knew the boys were angry because Cooley had denied them use of
his videocassette recorder, and knew they intended to beat Cooley
and steal several items, including the VCR and a stereo.
   O'Brien said he would consider an appeal based on the sentence
Fisher is to impose on the girls at an unspecified date.
   Fisher could order them held for a year, and state officials
then could decide to continue to hold them until age 21, assistant
prosecutor Debra Armanini said.
   The 13-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to deliquency involuntary
manslaughter and theft, and will be sentenced later.
   The 15-year-old boys face delinquency charges of aggravated
murder, aggravated robbery, child endangerment and intimidation,
and may be tried as adults.
   ``I think the verdict sends a message across this city that the
courts are not going to permit anyone, no matter what their age, to
take part in a scheme or plan to snuff out another life,''
assistant prosecutor Mathias Heck Jr. said.
   The girls' mothers sobbed, and one called the verdict unfair.
   ``I know she didn't do it,'' the woman said. ``He (Fisher) was
against them in the very beginning, regardless.''

   A 15-year-old boy convicted of killing a
classmate with a baseball bat ``to know what it was like'' has been
sentenced to life in prison, becoming the state's youngest prison
inmate.
   Rod Matthews could be paroled in 15 years under the mandatory
sentence he received Thursday after being found guilty of
second-degree murder in the Nov. 20, 1986, slaying of 14-year-old
Shaun Ouillette.
   Two former friends of Matthews testified he told them of
planning the killing and took them to see Ouillette's body, which
police did not find until nearly four weeks later in woods in
Canton, a suburb 15 miles south of Boston.
   Matthews showed no emotion when the verdict, reached after
almost 10 hours of deliberations over two days by the Norfolk
County Superior Court jury, was announced. Throughout the trial he
had been expressionless, eyes downcast.
   The decision satisfied neither the victim's mother, Jeanne
Quinn, nor the defendants' parents.
   Mrs. Quinn, carrying a portrait of her son and choking back
tears, told reporters she had hoped Matthews would be convicted of
first-degree murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence
without parole.
   ``He planned this,'' she said. ``Fifteen years. No, I'm sorry,
that's wrong. Shaun is not coming home in 15 years, is he? He's not
ever coming home.''
   ``It's terrible,'' Matthews' mother, Janice, said on the
courthouse steps hours after the verdict. ``A child shouldn't be
persecuted and forced to go through something like this.
   ``God only knows how much worse it's (prison) going to make his
condition,'' she said.
   Matthews takes Ritalin for hyperactivity, and defense attorney
John Philip White argued for acquittal by reason of insanity.
   Ritalin, taken by an estimated 800,000 children, has been a
standard treatment for hyperactivity and attention problems for the
past 30 years. But the stimulant drug has its critics, including
those who say it can cause serious side effects including facial
tics, extreme lethargy and stunted growth.
   White portrayed Matthews as a mentally unstable child whose
pleas for help were ignored by teachers and friends and whose
irrational behavior was possibly exacerbated by Ritalin.
   ``He was overlooked,'' said Mrs. Matthews. ``He was overlooked
in the third grade, junior high school. We overlooked him because
we didn't think there was a problem.''
   White, expressing concern for Matthews' safety and the
possiblity the youth might attempt suicide, said he will try to
have the boy moved from prison to a mental health center while
considering whether to appeal.
   An appeal must be made within 30 days, said Superior Court Judge
Roger Donahue.
   Matthews is the youngest of more than 6,500 Massachusetts prison
inmates, said Correction Department spokeswoman Mary McGeown.
   ``It just doesn't make any sense because there's no treatment
facility there,'' said Matthews' father, Kenneth.
   Prosecutor Peter Casey, a Norfolk County assistant district
attorney, called the decision an ``appropriate, well-counseled
verdict.''
   The case has been compared to that of Anthony Broussard, 18,
sentenced to 25 years to life in 1982, in San Jose, Calif., for
killing his girlfriend in 1981. Broussard, who was also tried as an
adult, took at least 13 schoolmates to see the body. The movie
``The River's Edge'' was based on that case.
   Matthews' trial, which began March 2, was broadcast on a Canton
cable television station. It was highlighted by graphic
descriptions of the slaying and testimony by Matthews' former
friends, Rob Peterson and Jonathan Cash, who said he told them of
his desire to kill in the fall of 1986.
   ``He said he wanted to know what it was like to kill somebody,''
Peterson said.
   After rejecting two possible victims, Matthews chose Ouillete,
an overweight high school freshman relatively new to Canton,
because he felt he would not be missed, the youngsters testified.
   Ouillette was lured to the woods after school by the promise of
fireworks before being hit at least three times in the head with
the baseball bat.
   Matthews took Peterson to see the body several hours after the
slaying, and they hid a knife Matthews planned to use to cut off
Ouillette's arms and legs, Peterson said.
   Several days later, Peterson and Cash went with Matthews to see
the body, then went to a pizzeria.
   Police found the body Dec. 15, 1986, after receiving an
anonymous letter from Cash.
   Matthews told a psychiatric counselor after the slaying that he
first decided to kill someone after viewing the videotape ``Faces
of Death,'' which shows animal and human deaths.

<HEAD>30 U.S. Military Aid Bolivia in Fight Against Drug Operations</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with three grafs to ADD recent calls in the U.S. for
military involvement. Picks up 3rd graf pvs, `The mission...'
^An AP Extra</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER MCFARREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of U.S. military personnel to
help in anti-drug operations has bolstered Bolivia's ability to
foil trafficking, but also has shown the difficulties of curtailing
a billion dollar industry.
   There are 30 U.S. military trainers and advisers, sent from the
U.S. Southern Command in Panama, now working with Bolivian
anti-narcotics police units and air force pilots, according to the
Interior Ministry.
   There have been recent calls in the United States for the
military to be deployed in the war on drugs and Bolivia is a
country in which the use of U.S. soldiers is being tried.
   The mission is a follow-up to the presence of 175 U.S. soldiers
and six Black Hawk helicopters in July 1986 for a three-month
operation known as Blast Furnace, says David Greenly, chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in La Paz.
   ``Blast Furnace demostrated that a concerted U.S.-Bolivian
effort could make a difference in Bolivia, that Bolivian operations
could have a similar impact and we are beginning to see such an
impact is possible,'' Greenly told The Associated Press.
   During the 1986 operation, 22 major cocaine processing labs were
destroyed and cocaine shipment and processing were seriously
disrupted. Farmers could not sell their coca leaves because
processing was snarled, and prices dropped from $1.20 a pound of
coca leaf to 40 cents, the estimated cost of production.
   Cocaine is processed from the leaves of the coca plant, which
peasants in Bolivia grow for its profitability.
   After the troops pulled out in November, coca leaf prices shot
up and trafficking operations returned to normal, Bolivian and U.S.
drug officials say.
   Since then, the U.S. trainers have prepared 720 elite anti-drug
police and taught pilots to fly five Huey helicopters on loan from
the United States. The helicopters, carrying Bolivian police, now
fly regular missions in the tropical lowlands where cocaine labs
are located.
   Bolivian police are disrupting operations in the Chapare
coca-growing region, where most of the cocaine is processed into
paste.
   This is reflected in a drop in coca leaf prices, the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency says. It says prices are down to 30 cents a
pound of coca leaf, even lower than Blast Furnace days.
   The volume of cocaine reaching U.S. and European markets has not
decreased and the price of cocaine has dropped, evidence of a glut.
   Bolivian cocaine production, which accounts for one third of
what reaches U.S. and European markets, has increased 10 percent a
year to an estimated 80 metric tons in 1987, according to a report
from the U.S. State Department.
   The cocaine produced in Bolivia has a U.S. street value in the
billons of dollars, the DEA says.
   Despite the concerted effort by Bolivian and U.S. forces,
traffickers have moved their operations to remote and hidden jungle
areas that are difficult to reach by road or even helicopter.
   ``The U.S. government, with all its military might, could only
make a dent on cocaine operations in Bolivia during Blast
Furnace,'' said Information Minister Herman Antelo.
   But he said that dent was important because it showed Bolivia
was serious about combating cocaine despite political problems that
Blast Furnace caused for the government.
   During Blast Furnace, marches were held to protest the U.S.
presence and opposition congressmen and political leaders attacked
the government, describing the U.S. military presence as an
interference in the internal affairs of Bolivia.
   When Bolivian police, DEA agents and pilots took over the
village of Santa Ananin in October 1986 looking for traffickers,
almost the entire town of 5,000 joined in forcing them to leave
under threat of death. Townspeople knew in advance about their
arrival, although officials say the planning was handled with
utmost secrecy.
   Bolivian and U.S. officials hope the presence of the 30
trainers, who are based near the city of Trinidad in the Chapare
region, will reduce corruption of officers by traffickers and
increase the effectiveness of Bolivian police and pilots.

<HEAD>Chicago Scientists Set World Record for Concentrating Solar Energy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two scientists set a world record for
concentrating the sun's energy with a homemade silver device that
could help make a practical, solar-powered laser, officials said.
   ``We consider this a breakthrough because it just hasn't been
achieved before,'' said Bimleshwar Gupta of the U.S. Energy
Department's Solar Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colo.,
which paid for the $150,000 project.
   Roland Winston, a University of Chicago physics professor, and
Philip Gleckman, a graduate physics student, used a borrowed mirror
and their solar concentrator to focus sunlight to 60,000 times its
normal intensity on Earth, the university announced Thursday.
   That concentration is about three times the previously achieved
range of 16,000 to 20,000 times normal intensity, said Gupta, the
institute's program manager for solar thermal research.
   ``This work opens whole new areas for applications of solar
energy,'' he said. ``Perhaps the solar concentrator could be used
to power lasers.''
   Most conventional lasers run on electricity, he said. There are
no commercially available solar-powered lasers because the
technology hasn't been developed to harness the sun's rays
efficiently.
   In theory, Gupta said, a solar-powered laser would be cheaper to
operate because conventional lasers require large amounts of
expensive electricity.
   And those advantages would be greater in space, he said, where
solar energy isn't weakened by clouds and is more accessible than
electricity or other types of energy.
   Gleckman, 26, who helped design the solar concentrator on a
computer, said scientists have used sunlight to power lasers
before, ``but not very efficiently.''
   ``We believe this solar concentrator we've built has the
potential to make a more efficient solar-powered laser. ... It
would be less costly and more practical,'' said Gleckman.
   The solar concentrator he helped design was made from an ounce
of silver in a university machine shop. It is hollow and
cone-shaped, about half an inch high and a half-inch wide at the
base, he said.
   It has a one-centimeter opening at the wide end and a smaller
opening, measuring about one millimeter, at the tip, Gleckman said.
   The device is fitted with a lens and contains a special oil that
boosts light refraction, he said.
   The 16-inch diameter mirror _ a standard astronomical telescope
mirror _ was borrowed from the university's Yerkes observatory,
Gleckman said.
   The solar concentrator's design was based on the principle of
``non-imaging optics'' developed by Winston nearly 15 years ago,
the university said.
   In a test Feb. 12 on the roof of a university physics building,
the solar concentrator achieved an intensity of six kilowatts per
square centimeter, the statement said. The previous record was less
than one kilowatt per square centimeter, it said.

<HEAD>President Rejects Faculty Vote on Tenure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the second time in a year, Harvard
University President Derek Bok has gone against a majority of
tenured law professors and will not recommend tenure for a
professor who is an adherent of critical legal studies.
   The critical studies philosophy _ that the legal system is
biased in favor of the rich and powerful _ is an issue that has
divided Harvard Law School.
   Bok, who was dean of the law school before he became president
of the university in 1971, announced his decision Thursday in the
case of Clare Dalton, 37, who has taught for seven years.
   ``My record was strong enough for tenure, and there was
political and gender discrimination involved in my being denied,''
she told The Boston Globe Thursday night.
   Bok would not answer questions about the decision, and the
prepared statement he issued did not give a specific reason for his
action, the newspaper said.
   The American Association of University Professors will
investigate, according to a spokeswoman in Washington. The American
Association of Law Schools also has been asked to investigate.
   Last May, Bok went against the law school faculty in not
recommending tenure for professor David Trubek.
   Tenured members of the law school faculty voted 29-20 last
spring in favor of granting Ms. Dalton tenure, four votes short of
the two-thirds needed under a rule change earlier in the year.
   Some faculty members say the rule is used by conservative
professors to block tenure for faculty with whom they disagree
politically. Daniel Tarullo, who also was recommended by a majority
but not a two-thirds vote, was denied tenure then.
   Last October, Ms. Dalton filed complaints against Harvard with
the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and the federal
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   She and a representative of the university asked the state
commission not to investigate until Bok completed a review of the
case. Her lawyer, Nancy Gertner, said Ms. Dalton has ``an extremely
strong gender discrimination case and an extremely strong political
discrimination case.''
   Last December, Bok appointed an outside committee to review the
case.
   The Globe said that according to a letter Bok reportedly sent to
law school faculty Thursday, the committee and Harvard Law School
Dean James Vorenberg and two Harvard law professors met for seven
hours Sunday, reviewed Ms. Dalton's scholarship, and decided that
her ``record was not sufficient to merit tenure.''

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary George
Younger defended British soldiers who shot dead three unarmed IRA
guerrillas in Gibraltar as violence over the slayings erupted in
Belfast for a fourth night.
   Younger said on the British Broadcasting Corp.'s television
program ``Question Time'' broadcast from Belfast Thursday night
that the soldiers challenged the three guerrillas before opening
fire on Sunday.
   ``They were challenged, we understand. If you challenge
somebody, in that second they convince you that they are about to
kill you, my goodness you have a right to defend yourself and my
goodness you always should,'' Younger said.
   The killing of the guerrillas, who authorities say were plotting
a huge car bomb explosion in the British colony, enraged IRA
supporters. The Irish government has complained about the alleged
lack of any attempt to arrest them.
   On the British mainland, 60 legislators of the opposition Labor
Party and some newspapers have also questioned the slayings.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Monday that the
guerrillas _ a woman and two men _ were shot when they made
movements that made the soldiers involved think their own lives
were in danger.
   Witnesses said the soldiers were wearing jeans.
   The IRA said the three guerrrillas were ``on active service,'' a
euphemism for a bombing or shooting attack as part of the outlawed
group's guerrilla war to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   The mainly Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic
under socialist rule.
   The IRA commandos were shot in the street by the British
soldiers believed to belong to the crack Special Air Services
regiment after parking a car near the governor's residence.
   Police said they believed the car was parked to reserve a space
for a car bomb that was later found outside the fortress colony on
Spain territory.
   Violence erupted in Roman Catholic areas of Belfast for the
fourth straight night Thursday. A press officer at Belfast police
headquarters said it was markedly lighter than on the previous
three nights of rioting.
   He said an army patrol escaped injury in a bomb attack in West
Belfast and two vans and a car were stolen and set on fire.
   He also reported some shooting and a gasoline bomb attack on an
ambulance, but said nobody was hurt in any of the attacks and that
army explosives experts safely defused two bombs found in the city.
   The officer, by regulation speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that in Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second largest city,
Catholic youths hurled gasoline bombs at a joint army and police
patrol but again nobody was hurt.
   By Friday, 60 of Labor's 229 legislators in the 650-seat Commons
denounced the killings in a motion as ``an act of terrorism....
tantamount to capital punishment without trial.''
   The motion charged: ``There was no attempt to apprehend or
arrest these people before killing them.''
   Labor's foreign affairs spokesman, Gerald Kaufman, has written
to Howe repeating Labor's demand for an inquiry.

<TEXT>
   Panama's ambassador to Belgium said
today that he has been fired but is staying on in defiance of
Panamanian military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Angel Riera Diaz said his aide, Navidad Moron Zanet, was
promoted from attache to charge d'affaires.
   ``But I am not relinquishing my office,'' Riera said in a
telephone interview. ``I do not recognize the authority of Noriega.
I recognize the authority of President (Eric Arturo) Delvalle,''
whose Feb. 26 ouster was engineered by the military strongman.
   Riera said Ms. Moron is a Noriega ally and had a hand in a
``break-in'' of his office Wednesday while he was in Strasbourg,
France, to lobby for a European Parliament resolution condemning
Noriega.
   He said five men whom he said had been sent from Panama,
``forced the door of my office'' and rummaged through his papers.
   Ms. Moron said the men were ``officials of the central bank of
Panama who needed the room for a meeting.''
   Riera said the men ``were a delegation sent by Noriega to
terrorize diplomats and to see if everyone is under control.''
   Similar disputes among Panamanian diplomats divided over the
Noriega-Delvalle imbroglio have occurred in other foreign capitals
including in London, Washington and Mexico City.
   The United States, where a federal jury last month indicted
Noriega on drug trafficking and money laundering charges,
recognizes Delvalle.
   The Belgian government had no immediate reaction to the change
of command at the Panamanian Embassy.

the rival Party for Peace and Democracy because Kim Dae-jung
refused to step down as its leader.
   Acting Reunification president Kim Myung-yoon told a news
conference his party would go its own way in preparing for National
Assembly elections expected in late April.
   He said his party had decided ``not to discuss the proposed
merger again'' because Kim Dae-jung had refused its demand that he
resign as Peace and Democracy party president by today.
   The Reunification Party made the merger bid after Kim Young-sam
resigned as its head last month, saying he wanted to pave the way
for reunification of the two main opposition political parties.
   Kim Young-sam warned that the opposition would lose to the
governing Democratic Justice Party in the elections if they did not
reunite.
   The parties split last fall when both Kims decided to run in
December's presidential election. That divided the opposition vote
and Roh Tae-woo won without receiving a majority.
   Kim Dae-jung refused Wednesday to resign and instead proposed
that he and Kim Young-sam lead the opposition until the National
Assembly elections, sponsoring joint candidates.
   In a statement, Peace and Democracy spokesman Ahn Dong-seon
charged that Kim Young-sam's obstinacy and meddling was behind his
party's insistence Kim Dae-jung step down.

<HEAD>Students March In Two Cities, Textile Workers Stage Work Stoppage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials let 2,000 students rally in
Krakow for the right to form an independent students' union, but a
bid to start a march in another southern Polish city was blocked,
opposition spokesmen said.
   The Krakow rally occurred Thursday evening after a Mass marking
the 20th anniversary of 1968 student demonstrations against
censorship that were brutally crushed by police and Communist
Party-allied worker activists.
   In another development, an opposition spokeswoman said more than
1,000 textile workers near Wroclaw staged a three-hour strike
Wednesday and won a promise of talks with managers in a pay dispute.
   In Krakow, students carrying banners of the banned Independent
Students' Union, Solidarity trade union and Confederation of
Independent Poland marched from the Mass to dormitories about 500
yards away and held a rally, said spokesman Zygmunt Lenyk.
   ``There were lots of police around the church but they did not
intervene,'' he said.
   Students who tried to march to the center of Krakow on Tuesday
were repeatedly charged by police wielding clubs, according to
opposition spokesmen.
   In Gliwice, meanwhile, five youths were arrested Thursday
evening when students attempted to form a march after a Mass also
commemorating the March 1968 disturbances, said Jan Mazurkiewicz, a
local activist.
   Plainclothes officers moved in immediately when some students
emerged, unfurled banners and tried to march after the service, he
said.
   At the Hanka textile plant near Wroclaw on Wednesday, 90 percent
of the 1,200-strong female workforce took part in the work
stoppage, said opposition activist Barbara Labuda.
   She said workers were angry that a portion of a $16 monthly pay
increase intended to compensate for recent price rises was being
deducted by management for the plant's vacation and recreation fund.
   Managers agreed to meet with the women on Monday, she said.

<HEAD>Many Of Feds' 1990 Goals For Injury Death Prevention Likely To Be
Met</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six of the nation's nine goals for reducing
fatalities from injuries by 1990 will probably be achieved, federal
health officials predict.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
the fatality rates from many types of injuries, including car
accidents, house fires and drownings, have dropped since 1979, when
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced its 1990
goals for the nation.
   However, some rates have not fallen as far as the government had
hoped, the CDC said. Although some of the 1990 injury-related goals
_ reducing deaths from car crashes, childhood household accidents,
house fires and gun accidents _ will be met, others _ such as
reducing deaths from falls and drownings _ won't.
   ``Achieving the 1990 objectives ... will require the coordinated
efforts of federal, state and local agencies ... academic
institutions, professional associations and private entities,'' the
Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.
   Here, from the CDC report, is a look at the nation's 1990 goals
for reducing deaths from injuries, and the progress being made:
   _Reducing the nation's annual motor vehicle fatality rate, from
23.6 such deaths per 100,000 Americans in 1978 to 18 per 100,000 in
1990. By 1984, the rate had fallen to 19.6, and the goal is
projected to be met, in part because of a reduction in
alcohol-related fatalities.
   _Reducing the motor vehicle fatality rate for children under 15,
from nine per 100,000 in 1978 to 5.5. By 1984, the rate had fallen
to 6.6, and the goal is projected to be met.
   _Reducing the death rate from falls from 6.2 per 100,000 in 1978
to two. The rate had fallen only to 5.1 by 1984, and the goal is
not expected to be reached. People over 65 continue to have high
death rates from falls _ for example, in 1984, 10.2 such deaths per
100,000 people age 65-74, and 147 per 100,000 people over 84.
   _Reducing the death rate for children under 15 in home injuries
from six per 100,000 in 1978 to five. The 1984 rate was 4.9,
already meeting the objective.
   _Reducing the drowning rate from 3.2 per 100,000 in 1978 to 1.5.
The rate had fallen only to 2.3 in 1984, and the goal is not
expected to be met.
   _Reducing the number of deaths in residential fires from 5,401
in 1978 to 4,500. The objective was reached in 1984, when 4,466
Americans died in such fires.
   _Reducing the number of deaths in firearm accidents from 1,806
in 1978 to 1,700. The goal was met in 1984, when 1,668 such deaths
were reported.
   _Reducing the suicide rate among 15- to 24-year-olds from 12.1
per 100,000 in 1978 to 11. The rate is going up, not down; it was
12.2 per 100,000 in 1984, up slightly from 1978 and up about 200
percent from 1950. CDC noted that various suicide prevention
approaches have been tried in U.S. communities, but their
effectiveness is not known.
   _Reducing the homicide rate among black males aged 15-24 from
70.7 per 100,000 in 1978 to 60. This goal will probably be met,
according to CDC researcher Dr. Richard Sattin; the rate had fallen
in 1984 to 61.5. This goal was set recognizing the high homicide
rate among young black men, Sattin said, noting that the national
homicide rate in 1984 was 8.4 per 100,000 Americans.

   Eight soldiers guarding the eastern
frontier against rebel incursions were drowned while crossing a
flood-swollen river during a patrol, it was reported today.
   The soldiers of the 61st infantry battalion were drowned in the
Honde River that cuts through the eastern highlands near the border
with Mozambique, according to a Defense Ministry statement
published by the Herald newspaper.
   The victims were a sergeant, three corporals and four privates,
the statement said. It gave no other details.
   Several battalions of Zimbabwe troops are stationed along the
750-mile border following raids by rebels of the Mozambique
National Resistance. The guerrillas have killed more than 40
villagers, abducted scores of others, looted shops and houses and
destroyed government vehicles.

<HEAD>Extradition Of Haitian Colonel Will Be Difficult</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Haitian colonel accused of conspiring to import
100 kilograms of cocaine into the United States is unlikely to come
to trial, U.S. officials have conceded.
   ``At present there is no extradition treaty between the United
States and Haiti,'' Ana Barnett, an executive assistant to U.S.
Attorney Leon Kellner, said Thursday after the indictment accusing
Col. Jean-Claude Paul was unsealed.
   ``This leaves a substantial question of how the extradition of
Colonel Paul could be accomplished,'' she said.
   A statement Haiti's President Leslie Manigat issued Thursday
through a Washington public relations firm called the indictment
``a matter of concern'' that will be handled in Haiti by military
courts.
   Paul, head of a battalion in the Haitian capital of
Port-au-Prince, is accused of conspiring to import 100 kilograms of
cocaine into the United States. His brother, Antonio Paul, and his
former wife, Marie Merielle Delinois, also were named as defendants
in the indictment.
   Jean-Claude Paul, 40, had close ties to the military-dominated
ruling junta that replaced President Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier after he fled the impoverished island nation in February
1986. The officer seldom appeared in public during the junta's
two-year rule, which ended when Manigat was inaugurated last Feb. 7.
   When he did, it often was to serve as bodyguard for Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, the junta president and now military chief, and Brig.
Gen. Williams Regala, now defense minister.
   The indictment charged that in December 1986 the accused
traffickers used a landing strip on Paul's farm 90 miles from
Haiti's capital to load and fly the cocaine shipment to the
Bahamas, where it was lost or stolen.
   Both men named in the indictment are charged with conspiracy to
distribute, distribution and attempted importation of cocaine. They
could face up to 45 years in prison and $375,000 in fines.
   Ms. Delinois, already a federal fugitive after jumping bond on a
related March 1987 indictment in Miami, faces the same three
counts, plus charges of jumping bond and attempting to extort a
fellow conspirator with violence. She faces up to 75 years in
prison and $410,000 in fines.
   The extortion count grows out of the unexplained loss of the
cocaine shipment on Spanish Key in the Bahamas, where it allegedly
was flown from Haiti for shipment to the United States.
   Osvaldo Quintana, a conspirator and now a principal government
witness, went to Spanish Key in an attempt to locate the cocaine,
the indictment said.
   When he failed to find it, according to the indictment, Ms.
Delinois told him ``his family would be killed if he did not pay at
least $250,000 of the money owed for the lost shipment.''
   Quintana, in a news conference here last month, said there were
two attempts on his life by armed Haitians, but no shots were fired.
   Quintana has testified for the government at previous drug
trials. In January, outside of a federal courtroom, he told
reporters he had once seen 9,000 kilograms of cocaine stuffed into
duffel bags in the Haitian presidential palace during the
administration of Duvalier.

<HEAD>Suharto Aide Elected Vice President After Moslems Drop Candidate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD background. No pickup. One name for
Suharto and Sudharmono</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GHAFUR FADYL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Parliament today elected a close
aide of President Suharto as vice president despite opposition from
a Moslem faction and some members of the military.
   The five factions in the 1,000-member People's Consultative
Assembly reached a consensus to elect State Secretary Sudharmono,
61, to the post after the Moslem United Development Party dropped
its candidate, Jailani Naro, who is party chairman.
   The Moslem party had opposed Sudharmono.
   Sudharmono's election came hours after Suharto was sworn in as
president for a fifth five-year term. Suharto has been president of
Indonesia for 22 years.
   The assembly, the nation's highest policymaking body,
unanimously reelected Suharto on Thursday. He was the only
candidate.
   Suharto, 66, reportedly told party members late last month the
next vice president should be able to lead the nation should he
become incapacitated.
   Sudharmono was nominated by the ruling GOLKAR party, an acronym
for the Indonesian words ``Golongan Karya'' or functional group.
   He was also supported by three other factions in the assembly _
the government-nominated military faction, the government-nominated
provincial faction and the nationalist Christian Indonesian
Democratic party faction.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some
members of the army had opposed Sudharmono's nomination and wanted
to nominate the newly appointed armed forces commander, Gen. Try
Sutrisno, 52, a popular figure and a former Suharto aide.
   The assembly meets every five years to elect a president and
vice president and issue a decree on the guidelines for state
policies.
   Sudharmono, 61, a retired army lieutenant general, is a military
lawyer. He is one of the country's leading bureaucrats after years
of government apprenticeship, first under the late President
Sukarno and then as a founding member of the Suharto administration.
   Suharto is expected later this month to form a new Cabinet,
which will have to tackle economic development and cope with a
hefty foreign debt of $42.1 billion.
   The country's economy was hit hard by the collapse of oil
prices, a drop in prices in commodities and the 1983 economic
recession.

   An explosion near two

the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported today.
   The blast occurred on the ground floor of a building near the
Saudi American Bank and the Koc American Bank in central Istanbul
around midnight Thursday, Anatolia said.
   The news agency said the explosion damaged two parked cars and
shattered windows of the two banks.
   Police were trying to determine what caused the explosion,
Anatolia said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blast, it said.

<HEAD>Tough Negotiations Predicted On U.S. Bases; Rebels Raid Police
Station</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. military bases here are
essential for both nations' defenses, but difficult negotiations
are ahead on how much Washington will pay the Philippines to keep
them, a senior American diplomat said today.
   Also today, the military said about 200 communist rebels dressed
in fatigues raided a police station, killing three policemen and a
civilian before making off with weapons and a radio.
   The rebels attacked Thursday afternoon in the town of St.
Nicholas in Pangasinan province, 100 miles northeast of the capital.
   In Manila, Kenneth Quinn, the U.S. deputy chief of mission,
denied allegations by the Philippines' foreign secretary that the
United States will step up political pressure on President Corazon
Aquino to extend the current bases agreement.
   Quinn told a civic club that the U.S. installations, including
Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval Base, contributed to global
security and played a major role not only in the defense of the
Philippines but in providing jobs to Filipinos.
   ``The bases are important because they provide for our bilateral
protection and for the external defense of the Philippines,'' Quinn
said.
   ``We think they're important because they make an enormous
contribution to the economy of the Philippines in terms of the
68,000-plus Filipinos who are hired there and the $500 million a
year which is spent in your economy,'' he added.
   Quinn described as ``absolutely false'' a claim by Foreign
Secretary Raul Manglapus that the United States was pressuring Mrs.
Aquino to say whether she wants the bases agreement extended.
   On Thursday, Manglapus, who spent more than 10 years as a
political refugee in the United States, accused the Americans of
``arm-twisting'' Mrs. Aquino ``because they have decided to stay.''
   The current agreement provides that after Sept. 16, 1991, the
Philippines can order the bases closed within one year. Mrs. Aquino
has said she will honor the current agreement but refuses to say
whether she will agree to an extension.
   Under the new constitution, any extension must be approved by
two-thirds of the 23-member Senate and may be subject to a national
referendum.
   The U.S. and Philippine governments are to begin reviewing the
current agreement within the next two months. Filipino officials
are expected to demand a substantial increase in the $180 million a
year which the Manila government receives in aid for use of the
bases.
   Quinn said he expected a ``full and frank discussion'' on the
issue of compensation, using diplomatic language which refers to
tough bargaining.
   Some Filipino congressmen have suggested that the United States
agree to pay off the country's nearly $29 billion foreign debt as
the price for keeping the bases.
   About 70 members of the radical League of Filipino Students
rallied in front of the Senate building today demanding the bases
be closed.
   They carried placards reading: ``Save the earth from nuclear
destruction; dismantle all U.S. bases.''
   On Thursday, Rep. Lorna Yap, a member of the House foreign
affairs committee, said the panel reached a consensus to enforce a
provision of the constitution against nuclear weapons.
   The constitution states that: ``The Philippines, consistent with
the national interest, adopts and pursues a policy of freedom from
nuclear weapons in its territory.''
   Some government officials argue the phrase ``consistent with the
national interest'' would give Mrs. Aquino flexibility to allow
such weapons at the American bases. Others see it as a ban on such
weapons.
   The United States refuses to say whether it maintains nuclear
weapons at the installations here.

<DATELINE>WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A candidate seldom seen or heard from
collected enough votes in a Democratic congressional primary to
make it into the runoff, but his two challengers in the contest
have cried foul.
   Johnny Welch, who has called for a manned space flight to Saturn
and a requirement that every American perform civil service,
captured 34 percent of the vote in the 6th Congressional District
primary Tuesday.
   He faces an April 12 runoff against N.P. ``Pat'' Kendrick, and
the winner of that race will take on Republican incumbent U.S. Rep.
Joe Barton.
   But Kendrick and ousted candidate W. Alton Parish think they've
been the victims of some sort of Republican conspiracy. Registered
Republicans can vote in either party's primary, as long as they
don't cast ballots in both.
   ``They did it intentionally,'' charged Parish, a Fort Worth
economics professor.
   ``There's something very suspicious here,'' he said. ``Mr.
Kendrick and I worked very hard on this campaign. We never took him
(Welch) seriously. Kendrick thought I was his opponent, and I
thought he was mine.''
   Gary Koops, Barton's press secretary, denied that Republicans
were behind the voting for Welch, and he noted that Barton had
worked with local officials throughout the district to produce a
record-breaking GOP turnout Tuesday.
   There was some speculation that perhaps voters confused Welch
with Louie Welch, the former longtime mayor of Houston who twice
waged a high-profile campaign against incumbent Kathy Whitmire.
   Johnny Welch's address and home phone number are listed with the
secretary of state's office, and a check with both the telephone
book and directory assistance confirmed the number is correct.
   But calls to the home address have gone unanswered; there is no
campaign office listed, and party activists in two districts say
they have never heard of Welch.
   Welch's three-point platform called for launching a manned space
flight to Saturn, mandating that every American participate in
civil service unless they pay a fee to the government, and feeding
and sheltering the hungry and homeless.

   The army blocked off some
cities in the occupied territories to media coverage during Moslem
noon prayers today after destroying at least four homes of
suspected Palestinian activists.
   At least five Palestinians were wounded during protests in the
West Bank and Gaza, hospital officials and Arab reports said.
   The mufti of Jerusalem, the city's top Moslem religious leader,
issued a statement lashing out at Israel for blocking some mosques
from worshippers, raiding others and confiscating loudspeakers used
to summon Palestinians to prayer.
   The mufti, Sheik Said Adin Alami, called on worshippers ``to
defend the mosques by all possible means despite the attackers.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, reiterated his
opposition to a U.S. peace plan for the region in the strongest
statement he has made so far.
   Shamir, speaking on Israel radio, said when he arrives in
Washington next week he would ``explain to our friend Secretary of
State George Shultz that his plan, as it's seen today, can't solve
the problem of peace in our area.''
   The army destroyed one home overnight in Hebron, 20 miles south
of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, and three others in Biddya,
30 miles northwest of Jerusalem.
   In Hebron, the destroyed home where 22 Palestinians live
belonged to Ahmed Mahmoud Abdullah Kawasmeh, 57, whose 22-year-old
son is accused of stabbing an Israeli settler from nearby Kiryat
Arba five months ago in Jerusalem.
   ``The soldiers came. They woke us about 11:30 at night and
ordered us out of the house,'' Kawasmeh, wearing an Arab headdress
and wrapped in a ragged blanket, told The Associated Press.
   ``I said, `But my son has not even been tried yet.' But it did
not make any difference,'' he said.
   The latest demolitions brought to 14 the number of Palestinian
homes destroyed by Israeli troops since the unrest began in the
territories more than three months ago, the Palestine Press Service
said.
   At least 87 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire or
beatings during the unrest, and hundreds have been wounded.
   The army turned back journalists from Hebron and Nablus, but the
clampdown was not as severe as last Friday, when roadblocks
prevented journalists from entering nearly all major cities, towns
and refugee camps in the West Bank.
   Friday is the Moslem Sabbath.
   In Hebron, about 10 Israeli settlers with rifles slung over
their shoulders patrolled a Jewish neighborhood near Al Ibrahimi
Mosque during noon prayers.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, noon prayers passed
without incident and Israeli soldiers kept largely out of sight,
although an army helicopter circled overhead.
   In the southern district of the West Bank, 60 of 250 Arab
policemen resigned after being urged by PLO leaflets to quit
working for the Israelis.
   In Ramallah, about 200 protesters threw rocks at soldiers after
noon prayers. Soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas to quell
the demonstrators.
   The Jerusalem Post reported, meanwhile, that the army is
currently holding about 2,600 Palestinian prisoners.
   In Gaza City, the army closed the main Al Amari Mosque for the
first time, creating what Palestinian residents said was ``deep
anger'' in the city. Some 2,500 worshipers usually pray at the
mosque.
   In other mosques in Gaza City, special ``Salat al Ghaib'' or
``Prayers for the Missing'' were held at the order of the PLO to
honor the Palestinians who have been killed by Israelis since the
uprising began.
   In Jerusalem, about 200 Palestinians protested after noon
prayers at the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa Mosques, raising
several Palestinian flags, which have been outlawed by Israel.
   On Thursday, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the Jewish state
would lose an opportunity to make peace by passing up the Shultz
initiative.
   Peres, head of the left-centrist Labor Party, said upon
receiving an honorary doctorate from Hebrew Union College in
Jerusalem that Israel would be making a fateful decision in the
next few weeks.
   ``In 40 days time there is a chance that direct negotiations may
start between a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and an Israeli
delegation,'' he said. ``In 40 days we may lose the opportunity as
well, and the grayness of hesitation, of suspicion, of postponement
may cover our skies again for time to come.''
   Shamir flies to Washington next week to discuss the initiative
one more time before announcing whether he accepts it or not.
   The plan calls for negotiations on the final status of the
occupied lands to begin in December, elections for Palestinian
self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by late 1988 and
implementation of self-rule for Palestinians in three years.

<TEXT>
   Austria today marked the 50th anniversary
of its annexation by Nazi Germany, capping a bitter two-year debate
about its World War II past that has polarized politics at home and
tarnished its image abroad.
   About 60 protesters gathered outside the chancellery to demand
the resignation of President Kurt Waldheim. Members of the liberal
Greens party boycotted a special parliamentary session marking the
annexation, known as the Anschluss.
   During World War II, Waldheim served as a lieutenant in a German
army unit in the Balkans that has been linked to Nazi atrocities.
He has denied any wrongdoing.
   Fewer than 100 people turned out in a light rain as Waldheim and
other political leaders laid wreaths in separate ceremonies at
monuments honoring Austria's unknown soldiers and victims of
fascism.
   During the ceremonies a dozen protesters gathered outside the
chancellory building 500 yards away, carrying a banner that asked:
``Who Will Make Waldheim Resign?''
   Until two years ago, Waldheim had not admitted that he served in
the Balkans unit. Since then, he has resisted mounting pressure to
resign.
   Greens delegates handed out pamphlets saying they were
protesting Waldheim's presence at the hour-long session. The
pamphlets said Waldheim ``is not representative of the Austria that
we want to commemorate.''
   The Greens said they would instead travel to Mauthausen, site of
a former Nazi concentration camp near the city of Linz, to honor
the victims of Nazi Germany.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky told a special Cabinet session that
the events of 1938, when this Alpine nation was forcibly annexed to
Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, were a central theme of Austrian
politics today.
   ``The events of 50 years ago pose relevant, fundamental
questions about the essence of politics,'' Vranitzky said. ``If one
attempts to avoid them, they sooner or later return with greater
emphasis.''
   Vranitzky said Austrians must recognize that crimes were
committed by their countrymen during World War II.
   ``We must recognize the fact of historical guilt ... because as
politicians we must draw lessons from the past failures of
society,'' he said.
   Vranitzky did not mention the Waldheim controversy.
   Waldheim, originally to speak at a Hofburg palace ceremony, was
to remain out of the spotlight throughout the day.
   Instead, Waldheim commemorated the annexation with a nationally
televised speech Thursday in which for the first time he apologized
for crimes committed by Austrian Nazis during the war. But he
ignored the debate surrounding him.
   ``We must not forget that many of the worst Nazi hangmen were
Austrians,'' Waldheim said in the 12-minute speech. ``There were
Austrians who were victims and others who were perpetrators.''
   The president added that ``as head of state of the Republic of
Austria, I wish to apologize for Nazi crimes committed by
Austrians.''
   Austria's Nazi past _ largely suppressed here over the past four
decades _ has dogged this country since the disclosure in March
1986 of Waldheim's wartime service in the Balkans.
   As a result, the U.S. Justice Department last year placed
Waldheim on a list that effectively bars him from entering the
country.
   In April 1938, the Nazis said 99 percent of Austrians approved
of the Anschluss in a nationwide vote widely believed to have been
rigged.
   More than half a million Austrians joined the Nazi party, and
250,000 turned out to cheer Hitler when he came to Vienna shortly
after the Anschluss.
   Last month, an international panel of historians found that
Waldheim had been in ``close proximity'' to war crimes during World
War II, knew they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them.
   The panel's report did not support allegations Waldheim
committed atrocities, but left open the question of whether he was
guilty of any crime. Waldheim claimed the report vindicated him.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A violent Jamaican crack ring that operated in
New York, Philadelphia and Washington and was responsible for a
series of murders and other brutal crimes has been smashed by the
arrests of several alleged drug dealers, authorities say.
   The arrests were the result of an intensive investigation
focusing on an epidemic of murders and shootings by Jamaican drug
rings in Brooklyn, said U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney on Thursday.
   The alleged ringleader, described as ``one of the most feared
crack organization enforcers in the nation,'' and six others were
named in federal complaints, Maloney said. One defendant remains at
large.
   ``The level of trafficking has risen and the level of violence
by Jamaican posses is very high,'' said Robert Stutman, head of the
federal Drug Enforcement Agency's New York office.
   The 50-member drug ring dealt up to $100,000 of crack, a highly
addictive cocaine derivative, each day in Brooklyn alone, Maloney
said. The ring, which had been in operation since 1983, also
allegedly ran less extensive operations in Philadelphia and
Washington.
   The complaint alleged the defendants were responsible for five
murders, 15 shootings, one abduction and one beating.
   The leader was identified as Delroy ``Uzi'' Edwards, 29, of
Brooklyn, who is a Jamaican national. Edwards, who drove a
Mercedes, got his nickname because he used to carry a submachine
gun under his trenchcoat, authorities said.
   Edwards allegedly murdered two of his dealers in Washington
because one of them had stolen money from the organization, the
complaint said. He also allegedly shot and injured three New York
members for the same reason.
   Another grisly murder described in the complaint was that of a
man who was beaten with baseball bats and then tied with chains to
the ceiling of a crack location. The next morning the man was found
dead, his body wrapped in garbage bags and dropped off on a street.
   After his arrest on a Brooklyn street corner Wednesday, Edwards
was turned over to the Brooklyn district attorney's office, where
he was wanted on an outstanding warrant for an unrelated murder.
   The other defendants were identified as Patrick Williams, Erroll
Thorpe and Ricky Nelson, all Jamaicans; and John Barry Russell,
Conroy Green and Stanley McCall, who were said to be U.S. citizens.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonny Frank said there was only sketchy
information about the defendants, but that most were in their 20s
and they all lived in Brooklyn.
   McCall is the only defendant still at large, Frank said.
   Stutman said violent Jamaican drug rings known as ``posses'' can
be found in many Eastern cities.
   ``They are constantly seeking out new weapons or tactics,'' he
said. ``More and more, especially the Jamaicans, are starting to
shoot back at police.''

   Iraq said it fired 11 missiles today into
Tehran and Qom, seat of Iran's religious hierarchy, undermining
efforts to halt the 12-day-old bloody ``war of the cities.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency also said Iraqi warplanes bombed
a tanker off the Iranian coast.
   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported that the 11th
missile was fired at the Iranian capital at 3:44 p.m., 16 minutes
before Baghdad had said it would stop its deadly barrages on
Iranian cities.
   Iraq had offered to end the bombardments if Iran halted its
barrages on Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. Baghdad also demanded
that it be allowed to fire the last shot.
   In all, the Iraqi agency said eight missiles were fired into
Tehran today and three into Qom, 60 miles south of the Iranian
capital.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency confirmed five of the
attacks and said there were numerous casualties.
   The agency said that in one attack, homes of two Jewish families
surnamed Odishiv and Roshan were demolished, killing and wounding
women and children.
   There were no reports of Iranian attacks on Baghdad. But the
Iraqi news agency said Iranian F-4 Phantom jets struck hard at
residential targets in the northern Iraqi city of Sulaymaniya,
killing and wounding several civilians.
   It also said Basra, in southern Iraq, and a cluster of towns
along the border were shelled by Iranian long-range artillery, but
gave no precise casualty figures.
   Iraq said that during the night its warplanes bombed a ``large
maritime target,'' a reference to an oil tanker, off the Iranian
coast, and seven Iranian cities today _ Baneh and Ardabil in the
north, Kermanshah and Hamadan in the west; Arak and Broujerd in
central Iran; and Dezful in the southwest.
   The agency did not identify the stricken ship, but said the
planes ``scored accurate and effective blows'' on all their targets.
   Iran's agency confirmed the raids on the cities, saying they
were aimed at civilian targets.
   ``This is a further proof to the Tehran rulers, who are filled
with evil intentions and hatred, that they should not have started
the war of the cities,'' the Iraqi News Agency said.
   It said the attacks ``were designed to avenge the innocent blood
shed in Baghdad'' and other Iraqi cities in the unprecedented
missile duel.
   Before today, Iran and Iraq had claimed firing 78 missiles at
each other's capitals since Feb. 29. Fifty-one were fired by Iraq
at Tehran and 27 by Iran at Baghdad.
   According to the Iranian agency, the previous attacks on Tehran
have killed at least 157 civilians and wounded more than 420. Iraq
has not provided exact casualty figures.
   Several missiles have struck other Iranian cities, including Qom
and central Isfahan, while Iranian gunners kept up a steady barrage
of artillery fire on Iraqi border communities.
   Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal said in Ankara that Iran and
Iraq had agreed to halt the duels at his request.
   Iraq announced Thursday that it would stop attacking Iranian
cities at 4 p.m. Baghdad time today, which is 4:30 p.m. Tehran time.
   Iran gave two times Thursday when it said it would stop its
attacks, but both deadlines passed with continued attacks. Today,
however, Iran has not reported firing any missiles.
   Iran's U.N. envoy, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, offered to honor
an unconditional truce if the U.N. chief called for one.
   Mahallati told a news conference in New York that Iran would not
fire back if Iraq got in the last shot before any deadline set by
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Perez de Cuellar had no immediate comment.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Down in February</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with Producer Price Index,
retail sales reports, picking up 3rd graf pvs, `Declining issues
....'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Declines in the costs of food and energy pushed wholesale prices
downward last month, while retail sales were boosted by strength in
autos, the government said today.
   Wholesale prices fell 0.2 percent in February, the Labor
Department said as it released its monthly Producer Price Index.
   Food prices fell 1.1 percent and energy prices declined 0.8
percent, the department said.
   For the first two months of 1988, prices rose at an annual rate
of 1.1 percent, half the modest 2.2 percent rate for all of last
year. Prices rose 0.4 percent in January after a 0.4 percent
decline in December.
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6
percent in February. The increase was generally in line with
expectations.
   The government also revised its January retail sales report to
show a small decline of 0.2 percent instead of an originally
reported increase of 0.5 percent.
   Even with the January decline, analysts said the sales report
generally reflected that the October stock market crash has had
little effect on consumer buying plans.
   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, any significant faltering in this area could
topple the country into a recession.
   On Thursday, nervousness over Wall Street's strength yanked down
stock prices, but pessimism disappeared in the energy markets,
where oil futures rose sharply over expectations that OPEC will
take steps to avert another 1986-style price collapse.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 48.24 points
to 2,026.03, its largest loss since falling 57.20 on Jan. 20.
Broader market indicators also declined.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 3 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, and the Wilshire 5000 Equity Index
measuring the value of 5,000 U.S. stocks fell nearly $40 billion.
   Analysts said the selloff reflected continued anxiety about the
aftermath of the Oct. 19 market crash, which persistently has
undermined investor confidence.
   The mood contrasted sharply with a buying spree on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, where contracts for April delivery of West
Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. crude, rose 51 cents to close at
$16.00 a barrel. Refined products traded on the exchange also rose
sharply.
   Petroleum analysts linked the oil rally to reports that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _ aware it can't
sustain relentless price discounting and excessive output _ will
shave 5 percent off the production of all members except Iraq,
which has resisted cartel discipline.
   The reports reflected hopes that after three months of price
erosion reminiscent of the cataclysmic market plunge two years ago,
OPEC and non-OPEC producers were taking steps to avoid another
uncontrollable drop.
   Since January, prices for Persian Gulf oil have fallen as low as
$13 per 42-gallon barrel, compared with OPEC's official price of
$18. West Texas Intermediate has dropped from about $18 to as low
as $15.
   In other financial markets, gold prices rose sharply in reaction
to the sudden strength in the oil market, which could portend
higher inflation. Gold is considered a good hedge against rising
prices.
   In the bond market, a barometer of interest rate trends, prices
fell in reaction to higher oil and metal prices. The Treasury's
30-year issue fell $5 per $1,000 in face amount and its yield rose
from 8.51 percent to 8.55 percent.

<TEXT>
   Two men were killed when a British Royal
Navy helicopter crashed off the Portuguese coast after taking off
from a warship that Prince Andrew was aboard, Portuguese and
British officials said today.
   Commandante Antonio Monteiro Coelho, a Portuguese navy
spokesman, said the Lynx helicopter crashed Thursday night less
than three-fourths of a mile from the training ship Engadine, where
Andrew was on duty as a helicopter warship instructor.
   Andrew, 28, is the third eldest of Queen Elizabeth II's four
children and a naval helicopter pilot.
   A British Defense Ministry spokesman identified the dead pilots
as Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Peter Gardiner Davies, 37, and Acting Sub. Lt.
Richard Alan Hand Cawthorne, 23.
   An informal lunch that President Mario Soares was to have put on
for Andrew today was canceled because of the accident, the
president's office said.
   On Thursday, Prince Charles, Andrew's brother and heir to the
British throne, narrowly escaped an avalanche that killed a close
friend skiing with him in Switzerland. The accident prompted calls
in the British press for the royal family to abandon dangerous
pursuits.
   The Defense Ministry spokesman, who was not indentified in
keeping with British custom, refused to say whether Andrew was
involved in the planning of the helicopter's test flight.
   ``It is normal practice not to reveal who is involved in the
planning of operations,'' he said. ``The whole thing will go before
the Board of Inquiry.''
   Monteiro Coelho said the helicopter crashed into the sea around
9 p.m., 50 miles west of the Cabo da Roca, a cape west of Lisbon.
   He said the cause of the crash was unknown. ``The sea was calm
and weather conditions were not adverse,'' he told the Associated
Press.
   The helicopter was badly damaged by its impact with the water,
but it did not sink, he said. The Portuguese navy answered a
distress call from the Engadine and sent the Portuguese corvette
Batista de Andrade from Lisbon to assist, he added.
   The spokesman said Portuguese naval divers helped recover the
bodies.
   Monteiro Coelho said Portuguese naval authorities had been told
that because of the crash, Andrew's ship would not put into Lisbon
for the weekend as scheduled. He said he did not know whether the
vessel would return to Britain or remain at sea.
   Monteiro Coelho said the helicopter was too far from the
Engadine went it crashed for those aboard the ship to have
witnessed the accident.
   Andrew, a combat helicopter pilot who saw action in the
Falklands war, was on regular sea duty as a helicopter instructor
aboard the Engadine, British officials said.
   The 6,500-ton helicopter support ship used for training was
carrying 73 crew members of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, the
logistical support arm of the navy, and an unspecified number of
Royal Navy personnel.

<TEXT>
   Telephone transcripts casting doubt on former
minister Walker Railey's actions the night his wife was almost
choked to death were released by a prosecutor who said he wanted to
``fill in the blanks.''
   The transcripts of two calls Railey made to his home answering
machine the night of the attack and a note he wrote before
attempting suicide 11 days later were made public Thursday by
Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Norman Kinne.
   In the transcripts, Railey describes his whereabouts in detail,
gives times and warns his wife, Margaret ``Peggy'' Railey, to lock
the garage door.
   Railey, 40, told police he found his wife unconscious in the
garage with a cord wrapped around her neck when he came home early
April 21. Mrs. Railey remains in a coma.
   Railey, senior pastor at First United Methodist Church and a
rising star in the United Methodist Church, took an overdose of
pills in an unsuccessful suicide attempt May 2, the day police said
they planned to interview him.
   After reportedly refusing 43 times to testify before a grand
jury, he resigned and moved to San Francisco, leaving his wife and
children, ages 2 and 5, in Texas.
   Kinne said he didn't have the evidence to bring Railey to trial.
   ``I feel like this may very well be the last anyone is hearing
of this, and I want to fill in the blanks as much as I can,'' the
prosecutor said.
   The answering machine transcripts point out a number of
discrepancies.
   In one call, Railey said he was phoning around 10:30 p.m. and
had a couple more hours of research to do at a Southern Methodist
University library.
   However, telephone company records indicate Railey made the call
from his mobile phone at 12:04 a.m., and library employees couldn't
recall seeing Railey when he claimed he was there, Kinne said.
   Railey explained he had to leave the library when it closed and
was on his way to another, and later called to say he was on his
way home.
   ``I'm not calling on the private line because I know you're
already asleep,' he said in that message, ``but in case you get up
with the kids, I just wanted you to know that I'm on my way home.
It's 12:30. I'll be home by about 12:45. Love you, dear. Bye Bye.''
   Railey called police about 15 minutes later to report he had
found his wife unconscious.
   In the four-page suicide note, he described himself as ``the
weakest of the weak ... the baddest of the bad ... and the lowest
of the low.''
   He said he was taking his life because ``a demon inside my soul
... has finally gotten the upper hand ... (and) lured me into doing
things I do not want to do.''
   Other parts of the note were published earlier. Railey has said
the letter reflected his despondency.
   Kinne also said he discovered that Railey spent more than an
hour that night at the home of psychologist Lucy Papillon, who
reportedly told grand jurors she and Railey were having an affair.
   ``There's a big gap between saying the man is not telling the
truth about some things and saying therefore he strangled his
wife,'' the prosecutor said. ``I'm not saying that.''
   Kinne initially refused to release the transcripts, prompting
ABC News to file suit. The suit failed but Kinne decided to release
the material after an appeals court ruled it was up to local
officials to decide the issue.
   The telephone at Railey's San Francisco apartment is unlisted,
and Railey could not be reached for comment Thursday. Railey leased
the apartment with Ms. Papillon.
   Mrs. Railey's mother and legal guardian, Billy Jo Nicolai, has
filed a civil suit against Railey accusing him of the attack on her
daughter.

<TEXT>
   An American woman who championed the
cause of Soviet citizens seeking to emigrate to the United States
to join their spouses has been divorced from her Russian husband.
   District Judge Kenneth Bronson agreed with Sandra Gubin's
contention that her husband, Aleksei Lodisev, married her solely to
enter the United States.
   ``The defendant's entire testimony is shot through with
evasiveness and contradictions,'' said Bronson, who heard the case
as a visiting judge in Washtenaw County Circuit Court.
   The only reason Lodisev married Gubin, Bronson said, was to
leave the Soviet Union. ``That's the only conclusion I can reach,''
he said. ``He planned his moves. He thought it out. The plan was of
long duration.''
   Gubin and Lodisev were married in the Soviet Union in 1981,
while Gubin was studying in Kiev. She returned to the United States
and spent several years trying to get an exit visa for Lodisev.
   She became nationally known as a spokeswoman for the Divided
Spouse Coalition, Americans whose spouses have been denied exit
visas.
   In January 1986, Lodisev arrived in New York. Eleven months
later, Gubin filed for divorce, saying that he married her only to
come to the United States.
   Gubin was awarded $113,087 for lost wages, expenses for writing
to political figures and medical expenses. ``There is scant
likelihood of collection on the judgment,'' because of debts
pending against Lodisev, Bronson said in his ruling Tuesday.
   Lodisev, he said, had run up about $22,000 in bills before
leaving last summer for a visit to the Soviet Union, which showed
``a pattern not just of stiffing the plaintiff, but of stiffing
everyone else in this country,'' Bronson said.
   Lodisev's lawyer, Craig McKinnon, said he was unsure whether his
client wanted to appeal. Lodisev, who works for a computer company,
had no comment after the ruling.
   Gubin, 40, a doctoral student in political science at the
University of Michigan, said she felt vindicated, but sorry for
Lodisev.
   ``I care for him,'' she said. ``I know he doesn't believe it,
but I do.''

   Guerrillas sprayed a police station with
submachine-gun and rocket fire, wounding two officers and three
civilians in the most serious of several nighttime attacks, police
said.
   The attacks late Thursday came hours before President Augusto
Pinochet was to address the nation in a speech marking the seventh
anniversary of his controversial Constitution, which allows him to
seek re-election this year for another eight-year term.
   Police said they believed the guerrillas were leftists.
   Security was stepped up today in this capital city of 4.5
million people. Army patrols in full combat gear occupied strategic
points.
   In the most serious attack, according to police, guerrillas
launched two rockets and shot submachine guns at a suburban police
station in southern Santiago.
   Two officers and three civilians were wounded. Police said one
of the officers was in ``extremely serious condition,'' wounded in
the stomach by rocket shrapnel.
   Another station and a patrol car were also attacked during the
night, but no victims were reported.
   At least three bombs damaged electric power installations during
the night and blacked out some sectors of the city, police said.
   Pinochet, who has ruled Chile since a bloody 1973 coup, has so
far refused to confirm whether he is running for re-election, but
he appears to be seeking the nomination.

   A woman convicted of killing three people
during a 1985 shooting spree at a shopping mall has been sent to
prison for life after psychiatrists said they could do nothing more
to treat her mental illness.
   Sylvia Seegrist, 27, was transferred from a state hospital to
the State Correctional Institution at Muncy on Thursday to begin
serving three consecutive life sentences for the random shooting at
the Springfield Mall, said prison spokeswoman Anne Forgacs.
   Under state law, Ms. Seegrist will not be eligible for parole
unless the governor commutes her sentence.
   Hospital psychiatrists and a psychiatrist hired by Ms.
Seegrist's attorney ruled that ``her coherence level has improved
and she is more cooperative,'' said Delaware County Assistant
District Attorney Dennis McAndrews.
   In June 1986, Ms. Seegrist was judged guilty but mentally ill on
three counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder
stemming from the Oct. 30, 1985, shootings.
   Ms. Seegrist opened fire on shoppers with a .22-caliber
semi-automatic rifle at the crowded shopping mall.
   McAndrews met Tuesday with Ms. Seegrist's attorney, Ruth Shafer,
and Delaware Coutny Court Judge Joseph T. Labrum Jr., who ordered
Wednesday that Ms. Seegrist be transferred to the medium-security
women's prison.
   ``Her dangerous tendencies are in remission at this time,''
McAndrews said.

<TEXT>
   Commuters on a subway route plagued by problems
today refused to leave a train that was delayed after a man fell
under the wheels. It was the fourth such revolt in two weeks.
   London Underground officials demanded an end to mutinies on its
Northern Line, where passengers staged three sit-ins last week.
   Subway staff asked passengers to leave the train at the Old
Street station after the unidentified man was taken to the hospital
with multiple injuries, Underground officials said. Most passengers
left but a dozen refused to do so until police arrived.
   ``The action of passengers didn't delay the removal of the man
from underneath the train,'' said London Underground spokesman
Roger Shire. ``But it's extremely disturbing that a dozen people
wouldn't get off.
   ``I can understand their frustration in being delayed, but not
in these circumstances,'' he said. ``They're not doing anyone any
good. Sit-ins are not the answer.''
   Spokesman Derek Salter said the man fell from the platform onto
the tracks just after 8 a.m. as the train was pulling into the
station.
   After the man was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, a station
guard walked through the crowded train telling passengers they had
to get off and could take another waiting just behind.
   ``The (halted) train had to be taken out of service. We have to
check for damage after such incidents for obvious reasons,'' Shire
said.
   Passengers complain of rudeness by staff, breakdowns, delays,
dirt, crime and crowds on the London Underground, which carries 2.5
million people a day.
   The sit-ins on the Northern Line, among the most antiquated and
inefficient routes, began on March 1.

   A regional train derailed near the Brussels
suburb of Lot today, killing one person and injuring 25, the
railroad said.
   The electrical wiring over the train was cut as a result of the
accident, and all service between Brussels and Paris was
temporarily suspended.
   Police were investigating the cause of the derailment on the
southern Schaarbeek-to-Binche run, said spokesman Louis Gilliaux of
the SNCB railroad company.
   Gilliaux said five people were seriously injured and about 20
suffered minor injuries. He did not have the identity of the dead
person.
   The injured were taken to several hospitals in the area.
   Rail traffic between Paris and Brussels was later rerouted, but
delays were reported.

<HEAD>CDC Reports on Failure Rate of Condoms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve percent of U.S.-made condoms and 21
percent of foreign-made ones failed in recent testing, say federal
researchers. The prophylactics have been advocated as a means of
slowing the spread of AIDS.
   As of February, the Centers for Disease Control reported
Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration had tested samples from
430 batches of condoms _ 165 batches manufactured in America, and
265 manufactured abroad.
   The FDA reported previously that as many as one in five batches
of latex condoms it tested fail to meet federal standards.
   The FDA rejects a batch of condoms if more than four per 1,000
fail in water-leakage tests. If two or more batches from a foreign
manufacturer fail, future shipments from that manufacturer are
stopped at their port of entry into the United States.
   The CDC in its report on condoms and sexually transmitted
diseases stressed that condoms can help prevent such diseases, but
that they don't always work.
   ``Individuals likely to become infected or known to be infected
with (AIDS) should be aware that condom use cannot completely
eliminate the risk of transmission,'' the Atlanta-based agency said.
   Lab tests have shown that latex condoms are effective barriers
to the spread of AIDS, hepatitis B, gonorrhea, chlamydia and other
sexually transmitted diseases. However, breakage or other mishaps
during use can negate their disease-fighting effectiveness.
   The CDC said condoms ``should be made more widely available''
through STD clinics, family planning clinics and drug treatment
centers.
   Those clinics and centers should ``become more assertive'' in
warning clients about STDs, and ``emphasize that the risk of
infection is most effectively reduced through abstinence or sexual
intercourse with a mutually faithful, uninfected partner.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a
virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Armed police guarded Tibet's main temple and a
military vehicle broadcast warnings against separatist activity
during a tense calm today in Lhasa, a Western tourist in the
Tibetan capital said.
   The tourist, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported seeing
20 armed police in central Lhasa in front of the Jokhang Temple,
the holiest site of Tibetan Buddhism. She said seven armed police
were also seen on the roof of a police station in the central
market square.
   The Western tourist, who speaks Tibetan, said she was told up to
200 people may have been arrested since thousands of Tibetans
rioted Saturday to protest Chinese rule.
   Chinese authorities broadcast warnings to Tibetan rebels today
to turn themselves in by March 20 or face punishment, the traveler
said.
   The tourist said vans with loudspeakers were driving through the
city every hour repeating the message.
   ``They're warning people to do their duty, report troublemakers.
They'll be rewarded if they give information,'' she said in a
telephone interview. She said one announcement called ``for people
to surrender _ people who were involved in the disturbances _
before the 20th, otherwise they would be punished.''
   She said Tibetans reported mass arrests, beatings and torture.
She was told details of the arrests of 10 people, but she was
unable to confirm other arrests.
   Most arrests were made Saturday and Sunday as Chinese police
pulled people from their homes during the night and beat them as
they were dragged away, she said.
   Other Westerners in Lhasa earlier reported at least 300 arrests
since Saturday's all-day clash between police and Tibetans
demanding independence. Monks and lay Tibetans stoned and knifed
Chinese police and lit bonfires throughout the city on the last day
of a major prayer festival, the reports said.
   Official reports have said two people, a Tibetan and a police
officer, died in Saturday's violence. There have been no official
reports of arrests.
   A Western source in Lhasa reported Thursday that Tibetans
reported 21 Tibetans and three police killed.
   It was the first major confrontation between Tibetans and
Chinese authorities since a series of anti-Chinese protests in
September and October that left at least 14 dead.
   Authorities have warned Tibetans not to speak to foreigners, the
Western tourist said today. Foreign reporters have been denied
access to the Himalayan region this week.
   A military vehicle patrolled Lhasa streets today broadcasting a
warning to Tibetans not to join separatists and to report any
suspicious activity, the tourist said.
   ``It's much quieter, but the military presence is still
obvious,'' she said.
   She confirmed earlier reports that the city was quiet Thursday,
the 29th anniversary of a Tibetan rebellion against Chinese rule.
The uprising led the Dalai Lama, Tibetans' god-king, to flee into
exile in India with 100,000 followers.
   China sent troops into Tibet in 1950 to take control, but it
contends the remote mountainous region has been an integral part of
China for seven centuries.
   Tibetans hold deep antagonisms toward the Chinese because of the
communist government's past suppression of Tibetan language,
customs and religion.

   A coalition for democratic change beat
pro-Beijing candidates in this British colony's first
territory-wide election in three years, the government-funded radio
reported today.
   Radio-Television Hong Kong said candidates backing democratic
change, such as the speedy introduction of direct legislative
elections, won more than 50 of 74 contested seats in Thursday's
voting for neighborhood advisory board seats.
   Although the boards carry no executive or legislative powers,
their members are the only directly elected officials in the colony.
   The radio said pro-Beijing candidates, numbering about 50 in a
field of 459, did not do as well as the reform coalition. But no
specific numbers were given.
   Activists who sought direct legislative elections this year say
the administration delayed the plan under pressure from China.
   Under a 1984 pact, Hong Kong will revert to Chinese sovereignty
in 1997 when Britain's 99-year lease on the bulk of the territory
expires. The pact also says the colony's capitalist way of life
will be maintained for 50 years afterward.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement officials are pressing for
more federal funds to fight gang warfare in the nation's
second-largest city, where seven more people were wounded in the
last day.
   City and Los Angeles county officials received $2.73 million in
federal grants Thursday to help battle the gang violence
responsible for more than 50 slayings in the county so far this
year, police said.
   The grant will be divided between the city, which will receive
$1.35 million, and the county, which will receive $1.38 million.
   But Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates described his
department's $949,639 share as ``teeny weeny,'' and Mayor Tom
Bradley complained that the federal government is ``in effect
sending us out to fight a war with nothing more than pop guns.''
   Three suspected gang-related shootings left seven people wounded
in the Los Angeles area Thursday night.
   Four people were wounded when a rifleman opened fire from a
passing car in south-central Los Angeles, police said.
   Two of the four victims were believed to be bystanders waiting
to use a public telephone, witnesses told police. The apparent
intended victim was a suspected gang member standing in a telephone
booth, said Sgt. Rich Gammel.
   ``I heard the shots and I went outside and I saw people lying
there bleeding and other people trying to help them,'' said Jason
Chung, owner of a liquor store near the shooting scene.
   ``I called the police and got my gun and went back outside. Most
of those people were my customers. They were just waiting to use
the telephone.''
   Witnesses said between 16 to 20 rounds of ammunition were fired.
   None of the wounds appeared to be life-threatening, Sgt. Steve
Faulk said.
   The gunman apparently used a .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle,
he said.
   In Compton, southeast of downtown, two drive-by shootings about
six blocks apart Thursday night wounded three more people,
including a 10-year old boy.
   The same car was described in both incidents, said Compton
police Sgt. John Garrett said. It was not known if the victims were
gang members.
   Gang warfare in Los Angeles gained national attention in January
with the death of a woman who was caught in gang crossfire on a
street in affluent Westwood.
   The death spurred racial tension in the city after more officers
were put on the streets in Westwood. Residents in poorer areas
complained that police were overlooking daily gang activity in
their neighborhoods.

   A train carrying segments of solid
fuel booster rockets for the space shuttle collided with a car, but
the rocket segments apparently were not damaged, NASA said today.
   NASA said that as a precaution, the segments would be examined
thoroughly next week after they are unloaded.
   The accident occurred Wednesday night in Biloxi, Miss., when a
car collided with a chartered train transporting the segments to
the Kennedy Space Center here from the Morton Thiokol plant in
Utah. Two people in the car died, police in Biloxi reported.
   The train's engine was replaced and the segments arrived at the
space center late Thursday.
   The train was carrying three of the eight segments that will
make up the two solid fuel boosters that are to propel the shuttle
Discovery into orbit. The launch is scheduled for Aug. 4 and will
be the nation's first shuttle flight since the Challenger disaster
more than two years ago.
   ``There was no apparent damage to the flight hardware,'' the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a statement
Thursday.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Challenger
explosion that killed seven astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986. The
accident was blamed on a faulty joint that allowed flame to escape
from one of the booster rockets.

   Republican Sen. Bob Dole today denied
he was dropping out of the presidential race, and he criticized the
news media for concentrating on such matters as his campaign staff
cuts, saying, ``I never thought that a campaign was a jobs
program.''
   ``I am running for president,'' Dole told a group of Illinois
Farm Bureau leaders, trying to stop rumors that he was about to
pull out after suffering crushing defeats to Vice President George
Bush on Super Tuesday.
   However, he told reporters after the speech, ``We will reassess
after Illinois. I am going to be very realistic about this.''
   Dole said the question of pulling out of the Illinois primary
was not discussed by him and his aides, but he conceded they did
discuss canceling some campaign activities ``to heighten whatever
we're going to do later.''
   He said his campaign had more than $1 million on hand to finance
its Illinois efforts. His problem, he said, ``is not money. We've
got the staff we need. What we need is to slow down this Super
Tuesday momentum.''
   ``It's hard to focus on the issues sometimes because the press
won't let us do that,'' he said. ``They would rather write about
how many staff you reduced your numbers by.''
   News reports also have noted that he has taken his television
ads off the air in Illinois.
   Dole made his remarks at the start of a day-long trip across
central and western Illinois to shore up his support in farm
country, which is considered his strongest territory.
   In a statement issued Thursday night in Illinois and Washington,
Dole had ``categorically denied rumors'' that he was about to drop
out in the face of Bush's big delegate lead and polls that show
Bush ahead in Illinois, which has its primary next Tuesday. Dole
has taken all his TV ads off the air in Illinois.
   ``I'm not a dropout. I'm a candidate,'' Dole told a suburban
Chicago veterans group Thursday night.
   ``We're going to be in this race all the way to New Orleans. And
now we're looking for an upset next Tuesday in Illinois.''
   Although Dole sought to shoot down reports that his presidential
quest was ending, several campaign sources said that option had
been discussed.
   The sources, speaking on condition that they not be identified,
said Dole met with campaign manager Bill Brock and other aides in
the past few days in Illinois and talked about the possibility of
abandoning the race because of Bush's commanding lead in delegates
for the GOP nomination.
   Dole, however, decided to press on in Illinois.
   ``I'm the underdog. The odds are great, but I've tackled great
odds before and I'm still here,'' Dole said.
   Bush's sweep of 16 Super Tuesday primaries has clearly wounded
Dole's campaign.
   One Dole aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dole's
private polls indicated Bush held a lead of between 15 and 20
percentage points in Illinois. That was described as a significant
increase for the vice president in the 48 hours following his
victories on Super Tuesday.
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll published today said Bush led
Dole in Illinois by a wide margin _ 58 percent to 31 percent.
   Although Dole had not said whether he would remain in the race
if he lost Illinois next Tuesday, one aide said: ``I think it's
clear to Dole that it's do or die.''
   ``I'm a fighter. I'm also a realist. I've looked at the delegate
count, and I've got to do well in Illinois,'' Dole said at one
Chicago stop Thursday.
   ``And I'm not in this race to see how long we can extend it. I'm
in this race to win.''
   Mari Maseng, Dole's press secretary, said 130 staff members in
Super Tuesday states were being cut because the campaign no longer
needed them. In addition, she said more than half of the staff in
the campaign national headquarters was laid off to provide money
for ``media and essential travel'' for the Illinois effort.
   There were no staff cuts in states with primaries after next
Tuesday.
   Maseng confirmed Dole had ordered his television ads stopped in
Illinois because ``we've changed our media strategy.'' Dole had
planned to spend about $500,000 on TV spots in the state.
   Maseng said campaign advisers were trying to draft a new
advertising battle plan to ``draw the contrast between Bob Dole and
George Bush as dramatically as we can.''
   The campaign, according to one source, is considering a
30-minute paid broadcast near the end of the Illinois campaign.

   A band of men wielding guns, swords
and daggers ambushed a bus carrying Tamils today and killed at
least 16 people, officials said.
   Police believe the attack was in retaliation for the killings of
Sinhalese by Tamil guerrillas last week.
   Today's killings occurred in the northeastern district of
Trincomalee and the victims all were believed to be Tamils, said a
military official. He could not be identified under military
regulations.
   The official said the attackers stopped the bus near the village
of Horawapatana, 28 miles west of the port city of Trincomalee, and
attacked the passengers.
   ``Our reports are that eight passengers were shot and butchered,
seven more were forced to remain inside the bus when it was
torched. Another died on the way to a nearby hospital.
   ``We have unconfirmed reports that the total dead could be more
than 22,'' the official said. ``All of them are reported to be
Tamils.''
   Police investigating the bus attack believe it was carried out
by Sinhalese in retaliation for the killings last week of 45
Sinhalese and Moslem villagers.
   Twenty-seven people, most of them Sinhalese, died when a truck
was blown up Saturday near Sitaru, and 18 more Sinhalese were
killed when Tamil rebels raided the Morawewa village Wednesday.
Both villages are in Trincomalee.
   Militant Tamils have been fighting since the summer of 1983 for
a separate state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where most
Tamils live.
   India has an estimated 45,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka to try to
enforce an Indian-sponsored peace accord signed last July to try to
end the war.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population. They claim they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the
government and the military.
   India has become involved because it has 60 million ethnic
Tamils in its southern states.

<TEXT>
   A court-appointed guardian for a
48-year-old comatose woman is supporting her family's request to
remove a feeding tube that is keeping the woman alive.
   Boston College law professor Paul R. Tremblay concluded that
although tube feeding was once considered an ``ordinary measure''
that a patient could not refuse, a considerable body of legal and
medical expertise suggests that is no longer true.
   Doctors for the family of Marcia V. Gray and the state, which is
fighting the family's request, say the woman will die within a
period of days to a few weeks if the feeding tube is removed.
   In a similar case, a family in Carthage, Mo., is suing the state
to force doctors to disconnect Nancy Cruzan, 30, from a feeding
tube because she would not want to live in a hopeless state. Her
parents rested their case today after they and another daughter
testified.
   The woman was left in what doctors call a ``persistent
vegetative state'' after a 1983 automobile accident. She is being
cared for at the State Rehabilitation Center at Mount Vernon.
   Mrs. Gray has been in a coma since suffering a cerebral
hemorrhage in January 1986. Last January, the Roman Catholic bishop
of Providence, Louis E. Gelineau, said it would be morally
permissible to withdraw nutrition from Mrs. Gray, who is a Catholic.
   ``It is in Marcia Gray's best interest that the feeding tube be
removed, once the benefits of continued feeding are weighed against
the burdens of that treatment,'' Tremblay said in a report
submitted Thursday to U.S. District Judge Francis J. Boyle.
   Tremblay concluded that if state officials at General Hospital
continue to oppose allowing Mrs. Gray to die, they should quickly
transfer her to a hospital that would grant the family's request.
   If no hospital were found, Tremblay said, the court should order
state officials to comply.
   The state asserts that honoring the family's request would be
tantamount to sanctioning euthanasia.
   Family members, Tremblay said, have provided ``adequate data ...
to satisfy the standards that courts have used'' to permit the
discontinuance of life-support systems for terminally ill patients.
   ``She was very persistent in her wishes, and insisted that I
promise not to keep her alive in a coma where there was no hope of
recovery,'' her husband, University of Rhode Island professor H.
Glenn Gray, said in an affidavit.

   A minor earthquake shook an area about 10 miles
southeast of Tacoma today, but apparently did no damage, officials
said.
   The temblor was recorded at 2:01 a.m. PST, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in
Golden, Colo. It measured 3.5 on the Richter scale, said the
center's Bruce Presgrave.
   There were no reports of damage or injury.
   ``For a quake this size, I really would not expect any,''
Presgrave said.
   Residents of Fife, Federal Way, Tacoma and Auburn called local
radio stations to report the quake.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

<TEXT>
   The government kicked off the Wedtech
racketeering trial today by accusing Rep. Mario Biaggi and his six
co-defendants of theft from the defunct Bronx defense contractor.
   ``This is a case about corruption and greed,'' Howard Wilson, an
assistant U.S. attorney, told the 12-person jury in U.S. District
Court.
   ``It is a case about public officials who want to get paid
twice.''
   Wilson pointed to Biaggi and former Bronx Borough President
Stanley Simon at the defense table and said they and the others
stole from Wedtech. Some had been promised more money, he said.
   At the trial's opening, Judge Constance Baker Motley told the
jury: ``An indictment is simply a series of charges. ... A
defendant on trial is presumed innocent and this presumption of
innocence is presumed throughout the trial.''
   The case involving the defense contractor includes charges that
the seven defendants looted millions of dollars in cash and stocks
from the company.
   The trial is expected to last several months.
   In addition to Biaggi, 70, and Simon, 57, the defendants are:
Bernard G. Ehrlich, 59, Biaggi's former law partner and a former
major general in the New York National Guard; Biaggi's eldest son,
Richard, 38; Peter Neglia, 39, the former regional administrator of
the Small Business Administration; former Wedtech chairman John
Mariotta, 57; and Ronald Betso, 39, a former city police officer
and close friend of Neglia's.
   They are charged with racketeering and conspiracy, which each
carry maximum 20-year penalties upon conviction, as well as various
other alleged crimes. Biaggi is also accused of extortion,
bribe-receiving, wire fraud, perjury and filing false tax returns.

   A powerful late-winter blizzard lashed the western Plains with
up to two feet of snow today, closing hundreds of miles of highway
in Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado and the Dakotas and stranding
hundreds of travelers.
   Up to 33 inches fell in the mountains of Utah.
   In southwestern Nebraska, the snow pileup cut off the town of
Kimball, whose residents opened their doors to about 600 stranded
motorists. And in an adjacent section of Colorado, several hundred
students had to spend the night in their school.
   The storm occurred 100 years to the day after the start of the
four-day Great Blizzard of 1888 in the eastern United States. That
storm claimed 400 lives.
   The storm, stalled near the Nebraska-Wyoming line before moving
east, pumped heavy snow and winds gusting up to 40 mph from the
western Dakotas across western Nebraska and much of Wyoming and
Colorado.
   In Nebraska, the storm was not expected to abate until late
tonight, deputy civil defense coordinator John Jenson said early
today.
   ``We've still got a good 12 hours of this to go,'' he said.
   ``It's going to continue to pack quite a punch as it spreads
across Nebraska and South Dakota particularly,'' said meteorologist
Pete Reynolds of the National Weather Service's Severe Storm
Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   Blizzard warnings were posted today over eastern Wyoming,
northeastern Colorado, western Nebraska and western South Dakota,
and winter storm warnings were posted through tonight for
east-central South Dakota, much of North Dakota and southwestern
Minnesota.
   In Utah, southeast of Salt Lake City, the Alta ski resort had
accumulated 33 inches of snow since Wednesday and Snowbird counted
31 inches. Freezing rain fell in the valleys and a 12-car pileup
blocked part of Interstate 215 Thursday evening near Salt Lake.
   Authorities closed 112 miles of Interstate 80 in western
Nebraska and eastern Wyoming early today due to snowpacked roads
and blowing snow, forcing hundreds of stranded motorists to find
shelter. Almost 100 miles of other Nebraska roads also were closed.
   ``I think I could have stayed home because I'm not going to have
any business, '' said Kelly Cheshire, 22, a cashier at a major
truck stop west of Cheyenne, Wyo. ``It's bad.''
   About 100 miles of Interstate 90 was closed overnight in western
South Dakota between Spearfish and Wall, but police said there were
few reports of stranded motorists. Two feet of snow was reported
today in Deadwood, with 15 to 20 inches in Sturgis and 12 to 18
inches in Spearfish.
   Sections of Interstate 94 were closed today in North Dakota and
the Bismarck Municipal Airport was shut down. The state pulled snow
plows off highways because of poor visibility.
   Several highways were closed in northeastern Colorado. ``At one
point we were receiving one accident every 60 seconds,'' Maj. John
Kammerzell of the Larimer County sheriff's office said.
   Up to 14 inches of snow and buffeting winds kept almost 140
miles of Interstate 25 closed in Wyoming. An average of 6-12 inches
of snow accumulated in the eastern third of the state.
   Wyoming Highway Patrol officers spent most of Thursday searching
for motorists on snow-closed roads, a patrol dispatcher said.
   No major traffic accidents were reported in Wyoming or Nebraska,
though the storm triggered scores of minor ones, authorities said.
   ``We've mostly had people sliding off the road. We're not even
pulling them out. We're just getting people out of the vehicles,''
said Nebraska State Patrol dispatcher Alex Haberkorn in Scottsbluff.
   ``When people call and ask what it's like out here, I'm
suggesting they stay home,'' he said.
   All roads into Kimball were closed Thursday night, stranding at
least 600 motorists in the town of 3,800, said Region 21 Civil
Defense Director Dan Jenson.
   He said residents were opening their homes to the stranded and
overnight accommodations were found for hundreds by midevening, but
the Kimball County Courthouse remained packed with people at 8:30
p.m.
   ``I've never seen so many gosh-dang people,'' Jenson said. ``I
really appreciate the citizens of the city of Kimball for opening
their homes to strangers.''
   In nearby Colorado, several hundred students in the Weld County
School District RE3J made themselves comfortable for the night in
school buildings when district buses couldn't get them home
Thursday.
   ``We just have some awfully bad weather, just a whiteout (and)
some of our roads now are plugging with drifts,'' said
superintendent Bob Gudka, who had 250 to 300 of the district's
1,200 students kept overnight in several schools.
   ``The kids are having a ball,'' he said. As for the teachers, he
joked, ``we may have to get psychological help for them later on.''
   The weather threatened hundreds of newborn calves, and ranchers
in the Nebraska Sandhills region worked around the clock to get
animals to shelter.
   ``The men are just exhausted'' said Marianne Beel, whose family
ranches in the area. ``We've got about 600 head of cows calving. We
worked all night long.''
   ``We had 300 calves born yesterday,'' she said. ``We're dragging
them in, separating them from their mothers.''
   Roads across northern and eastern Colorado remained closed early
today. The storm struck suddenly Thursday, dropping 6 inches of
snow in Fort Collins in just two hours. About 16 inches of snow
fell in Estes Park, Colo.
   ``I didn't expect this one,'' said truck driver Mike Brock of
Reading, Pa., who planned to check into a motel at Rapid City, S.D.
``I pulled off the interstate because a four-wheeler did a doughnut
in front of me and I decided that was close enough.''

<HEAD>Woman With Leukemia Learns Family Is Larger Than She Thought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Betty Flosky might never have
learned the truth about her life if she hadn't developed leukemia.
   The suburban Detroit woman learned late last month that her
parents were really an adoptive aunt and uncle and that her
supposed brothers were cousins.
   ``Everyone just held the secret all these years,'' said Gene
Wise, one of her cousins. ``I'm glad it's out. I wish it was under
better circumstances.''
   She also learned she had three brothers and a sister, all
unknown to her, who might be able to help her undergo a life-saving
bone marrow transplant.
   ``I'm shaking like a leaf,'' Flosky, 32, said after meeting
Lynne Kern, the sister who had just arrived from Denver.
   Flosky's mother died four days after giving birth to her. She
was taken in by an aunt and an uncle and never told about her
mother or father, who later died.
   Last month, doctors told Flosky about her leukemia, which could
be fatal within three years. She also learned that a bone marrow
transplant from a sibling was her best chance at survival.
   Wise and his brother, Norm, told her they would be tested to see
if they could donate marrow, despite knowing that cousins don't
make the best donors. Then on Feb. 25, Joe Flosky told his wife she
had been adopted.
   ``When he told me I sat there and said, `Is that it?''' she
said. ``I said, `I thought you were going to tell me I was going to
die.'''
   Since then, her brothers and sister have been contacted and are
being tested to see whether they can donate marrow. If any of them
tests positive, Flosky and the donor are ready to fly to a Seattle
hospital that frequently performs bone marrow transplants.
   ``It's like `The Twilight Zone' or something, isn't it?'' Flosky
said. ``Instead of my family shrinking, it's growing.''

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators say an Air Force bomb
expert who had been absent without leave for several weeks
apparently set off a blast in his pickup truck that killed him and
damaged a motel where he was staying.
   But officials said it was unknown if Staff Sgt. Donald Lawrence
Lunger detonated the bomb intentionally or accidentally March 4.
   Forensic psychologists will study Lunger's medical records and
talk with family and friends to determine why he placed a 10-pound
to 15-pound package of explosives behind the seat of his pickup
truck and attached it to a blasting cap, said Willi Ellison, agent
in charge of the Jacksonville office of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
   The explosives, wires and other materials found at the blast
scene indicated they were the type used at Eglin Air Force Base,
where Lunger was stationed. An investigation at the base was under
way to determine if any explosive materials were missing, Ellison
said Thursday.
   ``It has been determined that the explosion that resulted in the
death of Lunger was a deliberate act initiated by actions
intentionally or unintentionally taken by him,'' officials said.
   The charge could have been electrically detonated by the
cigarette lighter in the truck or flashlight components, Ellison
said.
   He said there was no indication that Lunger was involved in any
criminal activity, narcotics or espionage. He said he could not
speculate on whether Lunger was under mental distress at the time
of the blast.
   Lunger, 30, had been staying at the Southern Inn Motel for
several days before the explosion, motel employees said. He was
reported AWOL from Eglin on Feb. 22.
   Lunger, originally of Endicott, N.Y., had been in the Air Force
13 years. He was married and had two children.
   A national team of investigators was dispatched the day after
the blast, which smashed about 65 windows at the motel and caused
minor damage to railings and other exterior structures at the
two-story motel. There were no other reported injuries.

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state NAACP president and 13 other
black lawmakers argued today that they were protected by
legislative immunity when they tried to remove the Confederate
battle flag from atop the Alabama Capitol.
   The trespassing arrests of the legislators raised ``serious
constitutional questions and serious questions of state law,'' said
Fred Gray, who represents Thomas Reed, head of the state National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Gray also said at the court hearing that Gov. Guy Hunt lacked
the right to instruct officers to arrest anyone who attempted to
enter the Capitol grounds through a locked, chain-link fence since
the building is under the control of the Alabama Historical
Commission. The building is closed for renovation.
   Prosecutors from the district attorney's office did not comment
on the defense motions.
   District Judge Craig Miller granted defense attorneys' request
to file briefs and gave the district attorney's office 10 days to
respond. He said he would set a trial date later.
   Reed, speaking with reporters before the brief hearing began,
repeated his contention that the state should not fly the flag over
the Capitol. Reed and the other legislators maintain that the
Confederate banner represents racial oppression and slavery.
   ``People can fly it on their pickup trucks _ I have no problem
with that,'' said Reed, a state representative from Tuskegee.
   Reed and his co-defendants were arrested Feb. 2, minutes after
the Legislature's opening gavel.
   Capitol police and state troopers pulled down Reed and the
others as they made at least symbolic efforts to scale the 8-foot
fence. The lawmakers never got near the building and the Dixie flag
still flies atop the Capitol dome. Some merely put their hand on
the chain-link fence when they were arrested.
   Each lawmaker was charged with second-degree criminal
trespassing and released from the county jail on $300 bond.
Conviction on the misdemeanor count carries a maximum penalty of
three months in jail and a $500 fine.
   Reed had vowed for weeks to remove the flag. Hundreds of people
_ ranging from Ku Klux Klansmen carrying Rebel flags to black
students singing ``We Shall Overcome'' _ gathered outside the
Capitol for Reed's attempt.
   Hunt, who contends the flag is historic and not a symbol of
racism, has refused to remove the standard, saying the Legislature
should decide the issue. Hours after Reed and the other Democrats
were arrested, the state House defeated a resolution to remove the
flag.
   The NAACP also is trying to remove the banner above South
Carolina's statehouse and change the state flags of Georgia and
Mississippi, which bear versions of the Confederate battle flag in
their designs.

<HEAD>Magazine Says Higgins Will Be Freed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kidnappers of U.S. Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins have pledged to free him but set no specific
date for the release, the Beirut magazine Ash-Shiraa said today.
   The weekly quoted unidentified knowledgeable sources in south
Lebanon as saying the kidnappers made the pledge ``in secret
contacts undertaken by more than local and regional parties.''
   There was no way to verify the report independently.
   Ash-Shiraa gained international fame for disclosing the secret
U.S. arms sales to Iran in November 1986. But many of its reports
about foreign hostages held in Lebanon have proved inaccurate.
   Higgins, 44, of Danville, Kentucky, who served with a U.N.
observers group in south Lebanon, was kidnapped near the ancient
southern port of Tyre on Feb. 17.
   A pro-Iranian Shiite group, the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth, claimed responsibility for his abduction, charging he was a
spy for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. U.S. and U.N.
officials have denied the charge.
   ``The sources did not reveal an approximate date for Higgins'
release, saying this has been left for the kidnappers to set,'' the
magazine said.
   ``The sources have said that the important thing in this regard
is that a decision has been taken by the kidnappers to free
Higgins, such as what happened with (former) West German hostage
Ralph Schray, who was freed last week,'' Ash-Shiraa added.
   Schray, an industrial engineer who was abducted in Moslem west
Beirut Jan. 27, was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
captors March 3 in west Beirut.
   Syrian troops in charge of security in west Beirut's whisked him
the same day to the Syrian capital of Damascus, where he was handed
over to the West German Embassy. He returned to resume his life in
west Beirut two days later.
   Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing and
believed kidnapped in Lebanon. The longest held is American Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   A suspected bank robber pursued by police calmly
pulled over his van, stepped from the driver's seat and fatally
shot himself, authorities said.
   ``The man opened his van door and stood on the running board,''
witness Cynthia Everett said Thursday. ``I heard the pop of the gun
and then saw smoke coming over his head.''
   The man died about 10 miles from the bank robbery scene and
roughly 30 minutes after the holdup at the First Interstate Bank of
Texas in Seabrook, police said. Inside the van, police found a
briefcase with $10,550 in cash.
   The robbery occurred about 11:35 a.m. Thursday when a man handed
a teller a note demanding money, said Seabrook police Sgt. Nona
Holomon. The note claimed the man was armed, but no weapon was
seen, and the man left within minutes carrying the money, she said.
   A bank official followed the suspect in his own car, then
alerted police using a mobile phone. Three police cars followed the
van and finally surrounded it, police said.
   Houston patrolman Bobbie Miller said he had parked his patrol
car in front of the van to block it from escaping.
   ``As I was getting out of the (police) vehicle, I heard a shot,
turned around and he was falling to the ground,'' said Miller.
   Bank officials refused to comment on the holdup.

   A proposal to distribute condoms at
the 1988 Olympics Games in order to combat AIDS is being studied,
officials said Friday.
   Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee officials said they were
considering plans to provide condoms at the Olympic village and
sports facilities.
   Health authorities are concerned that the 270,000 foreign
visitors expected for the Games could spread AIDS in South Korea.
   The government has ruled out suggestions that all Olympic
participants and visitors should be required to take AIDS tests.
   South Korea has one reported AIDS case and about 15 cases of the
AIDS virus. The government recently passed legislation to try to
prevent the spread of the disease.
   Olympics officials, who asked not to be identified, denied press
reports that AIDS tests would be provided free of charge to Olympic
visitors who request them. The Games run from Sept. 17 through Oct.
2.

   ``From today on we are more European,'' said Antonio Testa,
president of the Chamber of Deputies transport commission following
approval of the bill Thursday after four years of study and debate.
   The law requires all cars registered in the last 10 years to be
equipped with seatbelts in the front seats by March 1989. By
September 1989, drivers and front-seat passengers will be required
to wear them.
   The law will also require child safety seats to be used for
children up to age 4 in the back seat and for children aged 4 to 10
in the front seat.
   Fines for not wearing seatbelts will range up to $160.
   An estimated 10,000 people die annually in traffic accidents in
Italy and 200,000 are injured.

<TEXT>
   The telephone company is cracking
down on U.S. Air Force personnel who have been using nickels
instead of British 20-pence coins to make cheap calls home, an Air
Force spokesman said Friday.
   It seems airmen stationed in Britain have for some time known
that a nickel works like a 20-pence coin in pay phones. A 20-pence
coin is worth 37 cents, so every nickel used for a call to the
United States saves 32 cents.
   Using the nickel swindle, a trans-Atlantic call that should have
cost about $24 would only cost $3.
   British Telecom, the telephone company, estimates the scam has
cost it about $52,000 in the past several months.
   Two airmen at the U.S. Air Force base in Bentwaters in eastern
England have been charged with cheating on long-distance calls, and
the Air Force is helping the telephone company end the swindle.
   ``We have warned everyone here that British Telecom is looking
out for people making fraudulent use of the phones,'' said Capt.
John Boyle, a spokesman at Brentwaters.
   ``The United States takes very seriously anything of this nature
and we fully support British Telecom in its efforts to track down
offenders,'' he said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev met a delegation of U.S.
senators at the Kremlin on Friday and warned them that President
Reagan may have a problem with jet lag when he visits the Soviet
Union later this year.
   During a brief photo session at the start of the meeting with
the delegation led by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Soviet
leader said, ``What time is it in Washington?''
   Then, answering the question himself, he noted it was only 3
a.m., Moscow time being eight hours ahead of Washington.
   ``I fear this group may become a bit drowsy,'' Gorbachev said.
   Having just visited the United States in December, he observed
that jet lag ``is far more difficult when you come back.''
   ``It will be a little difficult for the president when he comes
here,'' Gorbachev said, referring to the next summit meeting,
expected to take place in Moscow in May or June. But he added
Reagan probably will spend some time in neighboring Finland before
coming to Moscow to adapt to the time change.
   On long trips in the past, the president usually has scheduled
two or three days to relax and get over jet lag before the start of
major talks.
   With Cranston were Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed
Services Committee; William Cohen, R-Maine; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.;
and Carl Levin, D-Mich.

   Leaders of student protests at Gallaudet
University say today's resignation of Elisabeth Ann Zinser as
president of the deaf liberal arts college leaves other key demands
yet to be addressed.
   Separately, the chairman of the school's board of trustees said
it will meet next week to weigh those demands, which include
drastic changes in the board itself.
   Zinser's appointment Sunday had sparked heated protests over the
board's failure to appoint a deaf president, something the school
never has had in its 124-year history.
   Zinser, who has normal hearing and does not know sign language,
resigned just after midnight. She told a later news conference that
the siege was not the reason she resigned.
   ``What is happening across the country is a civil rights time of
the deaf community,'' she said. ``We have responded to that.'' She
called the protest ``a very special moment in time for the deaf
community ... (that) we could not anticipate.''
   Zinser, who began studying sign language only during the final
week of the selection process, held up her fingers in the ``I love
you'' sign as she told members of the deaf community, ``I send them
the message that we celebrate with them and wish them their day in
the sun.''
   In an earlier nationally televised interview, student protest
leader Jerry Covell said that while the students are ``very
excited'' about Zinser's resignation, they plan to insist on other
changes to make the school more sensitive to its hearing-impaired
students.
   Their first priority, Covell said, is for Zinser to be replaced
with a deaf president. In addition, the students are seeking:
   _The resignation of Jane Bassett Spilman as chairman of the
board of trustees.
   _A minimum of 51 percent deaf people on the board of trustees.
   _A guarantee of no reprisals against students, faculty and staff
who were involved in the protests.
   Spilman, appearing at the news conference with Zinser, said
there would be no reprisals. But she refused to address the other
two demands until the board meets early next week.
   ``It is for me and the board of trustees to assess,'' she added
when asked whether she will remain or whether the composition of
the board will change. ``I have begun to make that assessment.''
   She said the board would also begin looking for a new president
next week, but she would not discuss whether the job will go to a
deaf person.
   ``The school institution from the outside looks beautiful,''
said Covell, whose sign language was voiced by an interpreter on
CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program. ``There are people there who
don't understand and are not sensitive to our needs. And now it is
time. We feel that we are ready and we have ample support and
numerous people who agree with us. So why should we stop now?''
   Zinser, vice chancellor for academic affars at the University of
North Carolina at Greensboro, had stayed away from Gallaudet's
campus this week in the hope that the furor would die down, but had
insisted she was in charge.
   Spilman called the resignation a tragic loss to the university.
   ``We selected Dr. Zinser as president in recognition of her
superior academic, administrative and research skills,'' she said.
``Her strengths and accomplishments were precisely in those areas
most critical for the growth of the university.''
   Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis. and one of the university's
trustees, said a hearing-impaired person should be at the helm at
Gallaudet. Zinser was the only one of the three finalists for the
job who was not deaf.
   ``I've said all along, even before Dr. Zinser resigned, that
ideally a hearing-impaired person would be the track that we ought
to follow,'' Gunderson said.
   A large majority of the institution's 2,300 students joined in
the protests, which began Sunday with a march on Capitol Hill.
Students on Thursday threatened to seize the president's campus
house and office if Zinser made her way past students blocking
entrances to the school, and school officials chained shut the
doors to the administration building.
   Students from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in
Rochester, N.Y., had planned to travel to Washington by bus today
to show their solidarity with the protesters.
   Presidential candidates Jesse Jackson and Paul Simon offered
words of encouragement to the students, saying their protest
reflected the desire of handicapped Americans everywhere to take
control of their own destiny.
   The National Association of the Deaf, a 20,000-member deaf
rights group based in Silver Spring, Md., said it had been
receiving calls, letters and pledges of support for the Gallaudet
students from around the country and as far away as Great Britain.
   A university official who was one of the other two finalists for
the president's job, I. King Jordan, on Thursday had withdrawn his
support for Zinser.
   The resignation followed a warning by Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., another university trustee, that federal aid for the
school could be jeopardized if she refused to leave the post.
   The House Education and Labor subcommittee on select education,
which oversees Gallaudet's budget, scheduled hearings for next week
on the dispute.
   About 75 percent of the school's $76 million operating budget
comes from federal funds. The rest comes from tuition and grants.

   A brush fire 35 miles long and six miles
wide roared across west Texas early today, scorching an estimated
135,000 acres by midmorning, officials said.
   However, no serious injuries were reported and most homes in the
path of the fire were saved by hundreds of firefighters battling
the blaze, said Lawrence Winkler, information officer of the
Shackelford County Emergency Management team. Some firefighters
suffered minor burns.
   ``It's been a miracle, so far,'' Winkler said of the
firefighting effort.
   However, officials said, a cold front was expected to change the
direction of the wind today and turn the flames back toward Albany,
a town of 2,400 people about 150 miles west of Dallas.
   By 9 a.m., winds that had gusted to 30 mph had died down, but
National Weather Service forecasters said the calm preceded a shift
in winds along the cold front.
   Army National Guard troops used bulldozers to build firebreaks
to protect the town, according to Maj. Ed Komandosky, a spokesman
at the Guard state headquarters in Austin.
   Earlier, the fire threatened Albany, the Shackelford County
seat, but winds died down and the fire moved north and away from
the town, officials at the sheriff's office in Albany said.
   Texas National Guardsmen, ordered by Gov. Bill Clements to help
local authorities, joined an estimated 15 West Texas fire
departments and members of the Texas Forest Service in fighting the
blaze.
   Some fire equipment was lost to the flames, mainly because
firefighters were working in darkness, Winkler said. At times
during the night, the blaze could be seen as far as 35 miles away,
he said.
   At least one house, some mobile homes and outbuildings were
destroyed during the early hours of the blaze Thursday night,
authorities said.
   Some children were evacuated from homes in the path of the fire,
but Winkler said, ``Most people stayed there to fight the fire.''
   Nervous Albany residents watched during the night as the glow of
the approaching fire got closer, but there were no evacuations.
   Families that moved away from their isolated rural homes chose
to stay with friends, said Red Cross spokeswoman Cheryl Parks.
   The National Weather Service said winds gusted to 30 mph in the
area around the fire Thursday night, but Winkler said the wind died
down somewhat during the night.
   Albany, which dates from about 1880, was an early supply point
on the cattle trail to Dodge City, Kan.

   A 23-year police veteran was found dead
Friday in a cemetery of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound,
two days after his estranged wife was discovered shot to death.
   Officer Walter Krejcik, 44, was found a few yards from his car
with a .38-caliber pistol near his hand, State Police Lt. Jay
Dornbecker said. He said the death was being treated as a suicide.
   The body of Krejcik's 39-year-old wife, Pamela, was found
Wednesday at her parents' home in Clayton Township. On Thursday,
Krejcik was named in a murder warrant charging him in her death.
   Police said Krejcik's body was found by a worker or a passerby
at Flint Memorial Gardens, within sight of a large stone memorial
to city police officers killed on duty.
   Police said a note and pictures of his children were found near
Krejcik's body.

   Authorities said they will begin excavating
a site Monday in search of evidence in the shooting deaths of four
members of a family and the disappearance of a relative eight
months ago.
   Authorities on Friday would not identify the site or specify
what they might find.
   ``This site has possibilities but no certainties,'' Marathon
County Sheriff's Lt. Elwood Mason said Friday.
   Authorities believe 500 to 700 cubic yards of material will be
removed, Mason said. He would not comment on whether that material
might be dirt or concrete.
   ``It is not on land that is owned or under control by any
suspect in this case,'' Mason said, adding that was one reason for
choosing to dig at this site rather than any others under
consideration.
   Four members of the Kunz family were found shot to death and a
fifth family member disappeared from their rural Athens home last
July.
   ``Circumstances and events surrounding July 4 and 5 give this
site some probabilities but by no means create a certainty that
there would be something there,'' Mason said.
   District Attorney Rand Krueger said Thursday he did not plan to
file charges in the case this week and no one was in custody. He
said the number of suspects, which he had described earlier as more
than one but fewer than 12, remained the same.
   Helen Kunz, 70, has been missing since her relatives' bodies
were discovered in the family home. Ms. Kunz's brother, Clarence
Kunz, 76; their sisters, Irene, 81, and Marie, 72; and Helen Kunz's
son, Randy, 30, were shot dead.
   Krueger would not comment on whether a murder weapon had been
recovered.

<HEAD>Restaurant Violated Rights of Swastika Wearers, Judge Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A German restaurant violated the civil rights
of three patrons by refusing them service for wearing Nazi swastika
lapel pins, a Superior Court judge ruled.
   But Judge Kurt Lewin said Thursday it would be up to a jury to
determine whether Alpine Village Restaurant in Torrance was wrong
in refusing the three service in October 1985 after they caused a
disturbance when told to leave.
   Lewin said state law prevented the restaurant from refusing
service because of what the men wore.
   The suit, on behalf of Joe Fields, 24, of San Pedro; Stanley
Witek, 54, of Los Angeles; and Harold Follin, 28, of Anaheim had
sought unspecified damages as well as an injunction preventing the
restaurant from refusing service to customers based on their
political views. Damages would only be awarded if the jury sides
with the plaintiffs.
   Attorney Julia Tachikawa, who represented the restaurant, said
she didn't know if Alpine Village would want to appeal.
   She expressed disappointment that the judge ruled against the
restaurant's contention that it did not have to serve the men if
they wore things patrons might find offensive.
   Ms. Tachikawa said Lewin failed to take into account the
restaurant's constitutional right of freedom of association.
   ``In this case I was trying to argue that it was a German
restaurant, and the association was so obvious, the restaurant was
compelled to speak up that we don't hold that view,'' she said.
   The swastika was the emblem of Adolf Hitler's National Socialist
Party.
   Ms. Tachikawa said the restaurant contended the men were thrown
out not because of the pins but because they caused trouble after
being asked to either remove the pins or leave.
   American Civil Liberties Union attorney Carol Sobel, who
represented the men, said it didn't matter whether they created a
disturbance after they were refused service.
   She argued that the only issue to be resolved was whether a
restaurant could exclude someone because it disapproved of what the
person was wearing.

<TEXT>
   Judging by what Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir had to say in his letter to skeptical senators, this
tough-minded Middle Eastern leader may climb aboard Secretary of
State George P. Shultz's peace shuttle after all.
   Shamir reaffirmed his commitment to the 1978 Camp David approach
to negotiations over the West Bank and Gaza. The way Shultz has
structured the talks that would suffice for the first stage.
   But Shamir's resistance to the concept of trading the
territories or even part of them for Arab recognition is a
potential roadblock. So is the refusal of King Hussein of Jordan to
commit himself to recognizing Israel until the territories are
vacated.
   Shamir, who will be here Monday to see President Reagan, Shultz
and members of Congress, has a reputation for intransigence. So did
Menachem Begin, the last leader of the Likud coalition to serve as
Prime Minister of Israel.
   But Begin turned every inch of Sinai over to Egypt, stripping
Israel in the meantime of all its oil resources, dismantling a
first-class military airfield and uprooting Jewish settlers. Begin
gave it all away in exchange for a 1979 peace treaty with the most
formidable Arab country.
   The treaty was based on the Camp David agreements former
President Jimmy Carter worked out with Begin and the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland.
   Israel offered self-rule, or autonomy, to the 1.5 million
Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and in Gaza as an
interim arrangement. All options, including statehood, would be
open during a second stage of negotiations.
   The first round ended in 1981 in failure. Jordan and the
Palestinians did not participate. The Arab world shunned Sadat for
his treaty with Israel and only lately has begun to repair
relations with Cairo.
   Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., and 28 other
senators criticized Shamir for not being willing to give up
portions of the territories in exchange for Arab recognition of
Israel.
   But the prime minister, in his reply, left the option open _ as
the Camp David agreements do. He said the formula Begin and Sadat
devised ``would grant the Palestinian Arabs self-rule, following
which the sides would negotiate the final status of the territories
in question in a vastly improved setting of coexistence and
cooperation between Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Arabs.''
   In other words, Shamir still wants a trial period of Palestinian
autonomy before taking up a final settlement. He may harbor hopes
the Palestinians would elect to remain under Israel's security
control while running their own daily affairs.
   In a letter to Shultz in January, the Israeli leader excluded
only security and foreign relations as functions of autonomous
Palestinian Arabs.
   The scheme Shultz presented to Shamir and Hussein in Jerusalem
and London envisions a three-year interim arrangement. That should
be attractive to the Prime Minister.
   Also, negotiations for an overall settlement would begin only if
Israel and a mixed Jordanian-Palestinian delegation succeeded in
working out interim arrangements.
   That means Shamir could say ``yes'' next week to the president
and the secretary of state without committing himself to yielding
the territory Israel won in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   The prime minister's letter to Levin and Boschwitz suggests
getting him to give up even parts of the West Bank and Gaza would
be more difficult than persuading Begin to yield the Sinai.
   Shamir reminded the senators that Jordan's occupation of the
West Bank from 1950 to 1967 was never recognized internationally.
Egypt held Gaza during the same period, but unlike Sinai, the strip
along the Mediterranean was occupied ``militarily and illegally,''
Shamir said.
   ``We have sought peace relentlessly, but our Arab neighbors,
except Egypt, still have to prove in deeds that they are willing to
negotiate peace with us,'' the Israeli leader said.
   Shultz tried to pierce Hussein's decades-long resistance by
proposing to hold the negotiations in an international setting.
This is designed to give the king the support he seeks.
   But Shultz obviously could not guarantee Hussein that Israel
would withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza. So there's a big
question mark over Hussein's participation in the peace talks as
well.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Suppressing Evidence in Presser Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled today that
prosecutors illegally obtained statements from a former FBI agent
charged with lying about his role in handling Teamster President
Jackie Presser as an informant.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision that
suppresses as evidence the statements that former FBI agent Robert
S. Friederick made to government prosecutors in early 1986.
   The statements that Friedrick made to federal prosecutors
constituted the linchpin of the government's case against him. The
former Cleveland FBI agent is charged with five counts of making
false statements to federal agents.
   The appeals court panel upheld a finding by U.S. District Judge
George Revercomb that federal prosecutors failed to inform
Friederick that unlike previous interviews in 1985, statements he
made to them during the January 1986 session could be used as
evidence against him.
   Friederick's lawyer, William Beyer, said the decision eliminates
the only evidence that prosecutors have against his client.
   ``I don't know of any other evidence that they have to support
their claim,'' Beyer said in a telephone inteview from Cleveland.
   Friederick is charged with lying by telling FBI agents and
prosecutors that he was aware that Presser had been authorized by
the Cleveland FBI office to put ghost employees on the payroll of a
local Teamsters union.
   The case stems from an FBI investigation of payroll padding in
Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland that resulted in convictions of
Jack Nardi and Allen Friedman in 1983.
   Presser has been indicted on charges that he authorized the
payment of union funds to so-called ``phantom employees.'' As a
defense, Presser claims he was acting under the authority of
Cleveland FBI agents as an informant.
   Friederick, who was head of the Cleveland FBI's organized crime
squad, was questioned in 1984 and again in 1985 about his handling
of Presser as an informant.
   It was during a 1984 interview with Friederick and other
Cleveland agents that the FBI learned that Presser was an
informant. During a June 26, 1985, interview at FBI headquarters in
Washington, Friederick signed an FBI form that said he was required
to answer questions but that the government could not use his
statements against him in a criminal prosecution.
   Friederick was questioned on two other occasions that summer in
connection with the FBI's internal investigation of the handling of
Presser as an informant.
   The appellate court upheld Revercomb's finding that Friederick
was not warned during a Jan. 6, 1986, interview that statements he
made could be used against him.
   The prosecutors ``made a conscious decision prior to the
interview not to furnish Friederick with or even mention (the FBI
form); indeed they hoped that Friederick would make incriminating
statements that they could use against him in a subsequent
prosecution,'' the court said in an opinion by Judge Kenneth Starr.
   During the January interview, Friederick made statements
contradicting his previous assertion that he was aware that Presser
had been authorized to put ghost employees on the local's payroll.
The next day he failed a lie detector test.

<TEXT>
   The state Textbook Commission has rejected
American Indians' pleas to remove from elementary schools a book
containing stories by Washington Irving and John Smith that depict
Indians as blood-thirsty savages.
   The commission refused Thursday to withdraw approval for ``What
Joy Awaits You'' by Open Court Publishing Co., and said teachers
can offset negative images by teaching children to think critically.
   An Open Court representative said a supplemental text is being
prepared to help teachers discuss how perceptions of native
Americans have changed. The company also will revise the text in
1989 to include treaty violations and atrocities against native
Americans, but will not remove classical writings.
   The company said 10 other states have approved the book,
including Idaho and California.
   Commission member Clark Cox, superintendent of Alpine School
District, said removing or deleting offensive passages would ``make
pablum of literature.''
   Wil Numkena, education specialist at the State Office of
Education, said Irving's derogatory story of Indians may be
considered a classic, but ``at whose expense?''
   Numkena recalled that as a boy a teacher told his class that
Indians were bad, raided white people and took away white people's
land.
   ``Thanks to my mother and father who reinforced my understanding
of who I am, I was able to continue my education, understand my
identity and build self-esteem,'' he said. ``But many children
don't have that support system.''

<TEXT>
   The expense account was filed about 400 years late
and the government dispensed tea instead of money as a group of
people dressed as Elizabethans tried to recover the costs incurred
by Sir Francis Drake.
   Five Devonions from Drake's hometown, Tavistock, recited his
rhyming claim Thursday for 914 pounds, 17 shillings and 4 pence
from the British Treasury, to cover payments to officers and crew
aboard the Revenge.
   The five say Drake never got the money because Lord Burghley,
who conducted the war against Spain, thought he was being
overcharged. The expense papers were found in a museum in Plymouth,
Devon.
   At his office in Whitehall, the seat of government, Treasury
chief secretary John Major listened to the plea for repayment:
   ``And this, good Sirs, a tidy sum, was never paid to me.
   ``So we have come to you this day to settle up my fee,'' quoth
John Sterne, a shopkeeper dressed as Drake.
   ``Come up to my office for a cup of tea,'' responded Major, the
No. 2 man in charge of the nation's finances.
   ``After 400 years' inflation, this must be worth about 100,000
pounds ($184,000) now,'' he said. ``But I think it's out of time _
legally unenforceable.''
   After tea, Sterne, wearing doublet and hose, a tall hat and
carrying a sword, said, ``It seems that's all we're going to get.''
   Asked if his sword was real, Sterne, said: ``Oh, yes, you can
see it is _ it's my mother's.''
   Asked if he needed a permit to wear the sword, Sterne said:
``No, I wrapped it up until I got here.''
   The Tavistock Five said they were happy to dress for the
occasion.
   Pat Mildren was dressed as Queen Elizabeth I, Emma Nicholson as
Drake's second wife, and Pat Murray and Lis Lee as courtiers.
   Mrs. Mildren wore a crown, a floor-length green dress over a
hoop and lots of beads.
   ``I feel very good in this, but quite hot,'' she said. ``Excuse
me, my hoop is slipping.''
   The five said they will wear their costumes for most of this
year to celebrate the 400th anniversary of England's defeat of the
Spanish Armada.
   ``I'll do anything for my constituency, and Drake was my
constituent,'' said Mrs. Nicholson, legislator for Tavistock in the
House of Commons.
   Shopowner Mary Thompson said Mrs. Nicholson's costume took two
weeks and nearly $370 to make.
   The outfit, mostly from a brocade curtain, had one overskirt,
three underskirts, a roll to keep everything up above a hoop, a
stomacher with embroidered sleeves, lots of padding and a lace ruff
and cap.
   ``It's enormously comfortable. I'm laced in, stayed up and
covered in whalebone and I'm warm and wonderful,'' Mrs. Nicholson
said.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Dip 0.2 Percent In February</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices dipped 0.2 percent in
Feburary as both energy and food costs declined, including a
dramatic 70 percent tumble in the price of lettuce, the government
reported Friday.
   The decline in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
partially erased a 0.4 percent increase in January. Analysts said
it provided further evidence that inflation remains tame.
   For the first two months of 1988, wholesale prices have been
increasing at an annual rate of 1.1 percent _ just half of last
year's 2.2 percent rise.
   However, the producer index does not show two categories in
which price increases have been the most pronounced _ services and
imported goods. These items are included in the companion Consumer
Price Index, which was up 4.4 percent in 1987.
   At the wholesale level, food prices overall fell 1.1 percent
after a 1.7 percent rise a month earlier. Energy prices were also
down, but the 0.8 percent decline trailed January's 4.5 percent
drop.
   Gasoline prices fell 0.5 percent after an 8.4 percent plunge in
January. Home heating oil costs were off 4.2 percent after a 6.2
percent drop. Natural gas prices, up 0.8 percent in January, fell
1.4 percent.
   As for food, vegetable prices, which had increased 16.2 percent
in January, dropped 26.3 percent, a decline largely driven by the
drop in lettuce prices. The price of lettuce had tripled between
October and November because of shortages and crop infestation in
California.
   Fruits, down 3.0 percent in January, fell an additional 3.5
percent.
   Beef and veal prices were up 0.3 percent after a 3.4 percent
rise in January. Pork costs, up 13.2 percent in the previous month,
rose just 0.2 percent.
   Coffee prices fell 0.8 percent for the second consecutive month.
Alcoholic beverage costs were up 0.8 percent after rising 0.1
percent in the preceding month.
   Subtracting the usually volatile energy and food categories,
wholesale prices for all other goods increased a relatively sedate
0.3 percent.
   ``The stability which we continue to see in the (producer) index
is very good news,'' said Dirk Van Dorgen, president of the
National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. ``We don't need to
have to cope with a vexing inflation problem on top of all the
other basic economic problems we've got to deal with.''
   The producer index had declined as recently as last December,
when it was down 0.4 percent. The 0.2 percent February decline, if
continued for 12 consecutive months, would yield an annual
price-change rate of minus 2.2 percent.
   The teaming up of lower energy and food costs in February
``really was a break for the consumer,'' said Sandra Shaber, senior
economist for the Futures Group, a management consulting company.
``But there have been some strong increases in some services,
medical care, housing costs, which are not in the PPI.''
   ``We can't anticipate a continuing decline in lettuce prices,
unfortunately,' she added.
   Friday's report again showed there was little justification for
worries of a resurgence in inflation, analysts agreed.
   ``The news is clearly that we have very stable inflation
rates,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data
Resources Inc. ``We think energy prices will come back a little bit
in the next few months because they have dropped so far. But the
base inflation rate is going to remain very stable.''
   Other wholesale price activity in February included:
   _Prices for new automobiles fell 0.2 percent after a 0.2 percent
gain in January.
   _Capital equipment costs were up 0.2 percent for the third month
in a row.
   _Children's clothing prices fell 2.2 percent. Men's clothing
costs fell 0.1 percent. Men's apparel prices gained 0.5 percent.
   _Tobacco prices gained 0.9 percent after a 1.2 percent drop in
January.
   February's decline brought the overall wholesale price index to
105.9. This means that a selection of wholesale goods costing $100
during a 1982 base period would have cost $105.90 last month. The
index itself is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are other
figures in the report.
   The Labor Department recently switched from a 1967 base period
for both its producer and consumer price index figures.
   Using the 1967 base, the February index would have been 297.3.
That compares to a 292.3 index in February 1988. In other words,
goods costing $100 in 1967 would have cost $292.30 in February 1987
and $297.30 in February 1988.

<TEXT>
   Merrill K. Riddick, a colorful and quixotic
figure who campaigned for president three times as the candidate of
the Puritan Ethic and Epic, Magnetohydrodynamics and Prohibition
Party, has died at the age of 93.
   Riddick, who died Wednesday of cancer, also was a World War I
aviator and 1920s barnstormer before moving to Montana to prospect
for gold.
   He ran for president in 1976, 1980 and 1984, campaigning across
the country on the Greyhound buses where he also slept.
   ``I live on the bus,'' he said in 1981. ``I can get the bus
passes for less than $12 a day. It's cheaper than living in a
hotel.''
   He lost his presidential bids, obviously. But that was nothing
new for Riddick. He had been running for office since 1960 and
losing spectacularly just as long.
   But politics was a relatively late interest for Riddick, also
known as one of the nation's earliest aviators.
   He was a graduate of the Army Air Corps' first pilot class in
San Diego in 1917 and flew reconnaissance missions over Europe in
World War I. He became one of the nation's first airmail pilots and
instructed at the nation's first private flight school, alongside
fellow instructor Eddie Rickenbacker.
   Riddick also was a 1920s barnstormer, an itinerant pilot who
made a living giving air shows and selling rides, before moving to
Montana as a gold prospector.
   He launched his political career with a bid for the Montana
Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1960. He finished sixth in a
field of six. He tried again in 1968 with the same result.
   He switched parties to run for the Senate in 1972. He finished
fourth among four Republicans.
   And with that long political background, he launched his bids
for the presidency.
   His party was his own creation. The Puritan Ethic and Epic in
the title stood for moral values. Magnetohydrodynamics is a
high-tech process for turning coal into electricity. Prohibition
marked his personal belief.
   Perennial losing candidates are not unusual in American
politics. But Riddick's quests earned him a place in the hearts of
many in Montana, a state proud of its individualists.
   A restaurant freqented by politicians in Helena, the state
capital, named a private dining room after Riddick. The airport in
Philipsburg, his home, was named for him. And the 341st Strategic
Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls named him an
honorary missileman.
   ``He had a long, full life,'' said his sister, Ruth McClain.
``His mind was clear to the end.''
   Mrs. McClain said he probably would be buried in Annapolis, Md.,
near the grave of his father, former U.S. Rep. Carl Riddick.

   A Georgia Power Co. worker was electrocuted
Friday when he came into contact with a low voltage cable, and
electricity was shut off to some downtown office buildings, the
company said.
   Georgia Power spokeswoman Meg Reggie said Johnny Lane, a lead
cable splicer, was working in an underground vault behind the
offices of The Atlanta Newspapers Inc., when he came in contact
with the cable and was knocked unconscious.
   Lane, 35, died shortly before 10 a.m., Grady Memorial Hospital
spokeswoman Beverly Thomas said.
   Power was then shut off to allow rescue workers to reach him,
she said.
   The 90-minute outage interrupted power to CNN Center, which
includes studios of Cable News Network and offices of The
Associated Press, and to offices of The Atlanta Journal and The
Atlanta Constitution. CNN was knocked off the air for about four
seconds before emergency power kicked in, a producer said.

<TEXT>
   A man who held a teen-age girl captive
in a motel room and fired at FBI agents has been sentenced to 25
years in prison on extortion, assault and firearms violations.
   Richard Lee Brown received the maximum sentences in federal
court Thursday for charges stemming from the siege in September in
Lake City, about 50 miles west of here. Brown held 17-year-old
Stacey Ann Sapp of Savannah, Ga., hostage during the siege.
   Brown, who had been traveling around the country with Miss Sapp
for several weeks, called her father and threatened to harm her
unless the father paid $30,000 in ransom. But authorities
intervened after Miss Sapp's father called the FBI, and a 21-hour
standoff followed at the motel.
   In January, Brown pleaded guilty to two charges of assaulting a
federal officer with a deadly weapon, as well as one count each of
using a firearm in a violent crime and transmitting an extortion
demand across state lines.
   Brown, of Tallahassee, had told officials he was possessed by
demons and had angels inside his body. A court-appointed
psychiatrist said he suffered from several personality disorders.
   He was judged competent to stand trial, however, after the
psychiatrist said he understood right from wrong and the charges
against him.
   Brown also had been charged with extortion in Georgia, but those
were dropped as part of his plea-bargain agreement.

   Gary Hart ended his on-again, off-again bid for
the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination today, saying, ``The
people have decided and now I should not go forward.''
   It was the second withdrawal for the man who once was the
prohibitive front-runner for his party's nomination, coming 10
months after he quit because of questions concerning his
relationship with Miami model Donna Rice.
   Flanked by members of his family, Hart told a news conference
that when he rejoined the race last December, he wanted to ``let
the people decide.''
   ``I got a fair hearing and the people have decided and now I
should not go forward,'' he declared.
   The former Colorado senator departed with words of praise for
the surviving Democratic contenders, but with thinly veiled
criticism, as well.
   He said Democrats have won only a single presidential election
since 1964, and added, ``Those who cling to the past mask their
lack of direction with caution and platitudes. We can only be
prepared to govern if we challenge the future with bold new ideas.''
   He said the contenders must offer detailed budget proposals and
learn the details of military reform _ two points he made
repeatedly in his rerun for the nomination.
   Hart second exit contained only a trace of the defiance that
marked his departure in May, but he struck one similar note.
   ``To those of you in and out of politics who may face setbacks,
failures or defeats _ who are told to give up, accommodate or
compromise _ I hope you will simply say as I do _ `hell no,''' Hart
said.
   Hart also stepped back from the criticism of reporters that
marked his second try for the nomination, saying, ``I want to thank
members of the media who were fair and balanced.''
   Hart's announcement capped a story as bizarre as any in modern
presidential politics.
   He was the overwhelming favorite for the nomination when he
announced his bid a year ago, but his campaign self-destructed in
the springtime scandal.
   He plunged back into the campaign last December and briefly
soared in the polls, but it quickly became clear the voters were
deciding he wasn't their man, relegating him to the back of the
pack in the early primaries and caucuses.
   Hart failed to garner a single delegate to the 1988 Democratic
National Convention, and his vote percentage never reached double
digits in any contest. When the dust settled from this week's
20-state Super Tuesday contests, the Federal Election Commission
announced that Hart was no longer eligible for federal campaign
matching funds.
   Hart's undoing in his initial bid came when the Miami Herald
newspaper staked out his Washington townhouse and reported that
Rice, 29, a part-time model, spent a night there.
   There were questions about that, because the paper admitted it
did not have every entrance monitored all night. But then photos of
Rice sitting on Hart's knee aboard a yacht called the Monkey
Business on a trip to Bimini surfaced.
   Hart, however, repeatedly refused to discuss specifics of his
relationship with Rice, saying it was his personal business.
   Later he admitted: ``I never should have been on a boat with a
woman who was not my wife, but that's not the issue. It's
complicated. It's the system. It's all of us.''
   After seven months on the sidelines, he announced in December in
New Hampshire _ in a dramatic steps-of-the-Statehouse news
conference _ that he was back in the race and would ``let the
people decide.''
   He could not, he said, withhold his views on public policy and
issues during this presidential campaign. He vowed to run a
grassroots campaign, with little money and an informal organization.
   However, he sustained another serious blow in January when there
were reports that Hollywood video producer Stuart Karl improperly
bankrolled his campaigns.
   ``When we needed fliers printed or a chartered plane, Stuart
managed to get it done,'' one source told The Associated Press.
``(Dennis) Walto was a full-time advance man for Hart and he was on
Karl's payroll. ...Stuart picked up a variety of other things.''
   Hart said he was unaware of any wrongdoing, but: ``I will hold
myself responsible for whatever happened and not shift any blame to
anyone else. Obviously a candidate cannot know every detail.''
   He later acknowledged that several contributions from employees
of Karl were illegal and he was returning the money.

<HEAD>Justice Department Says It Will Close PLO Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States told Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar today it will move next week to close the
PLO's observer mission at the United Nations.
   Perez de Cuellar replied with a ``strong'' protest to U.S.
Ambassador Herbert Okun, according to U.N. spokesman Francois
Giulaini.
   Okun's letter to the U.N. chief says the Justice Department will
initiate legal action to close the Palestine Liberation
Organization mission around March 21.
   It also says the United States will not try to close the mission
until the litigation is resolved.
   Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar's legal staff is ``studying
options,'' but he refused to describe them or say if the United
Nations would join the litigation on behalf of the PLO.
   The United Nations released copies of Okun's letter to the
secretary-general during a press briefing after the two diplomats
met this morning.
   Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar ``strongly protested this
violation of the headquarters agreement'' during the meeting.
   The letter also says that the United States refuses binding
arbitration of the dispute over the mission, the worst
confrontation ever between the United Nations and its host country.
   The 159-nation General Assembly, in a special meeting last
month, asked the World Court in the Hague to rule on whether the
United States must agree to arbitration. Oral arguments are
scheduled for April 11.
   U.N. officials and diplomats regard the threat to the PLO
mission as a challenge to the independence of the United Nations.
   They and the State Department have said the 1947 treaty under
which New York became U.N. headquarters obliges the United States
to let all accredited missions operate.
   Even the United States' closest allies have denounced the
attempt to close the mission and several Arab diplomats have
suggested that the General Assembly move to Geneva if the mission
here is closed.
   It was not clear if the assembly would convene again to consider
the dispute.
   Last year, the State Department closed down the only other PLO
office in the United States, an information office in Washington,
in what turned out to be a futile attempt to head off legislation
ordering the U.N. mission closed.
   Despite this and despite the headquarters treaty, Congress
passed an anti-terrorism law in December ordering the mission
closed by March 21.
   The United States and Israel consider the PLO a terrorist
organization. But the United Nations recognizes it as the only
legitimate spokesman for Palestinians.

   Two people who claim they have
information that could clear a condemned murderer said today they
were disappointed the governor refused to meet with them to discuss
the case, which has become a rallying point for death penalty
opponents.
   The Rev. Sam Sparks, a Baptist minister, and Christine Bass, a
Lakeland secretary, appeared at a news conference with Amnesty
International officials to discuss about information they believe
might clear Willie Jasper Darden of murder.
   Darden is under his seventh death warrant and is scheduled for
electrocution Tuesday for the 1973 slaying of a furniture store
owner.
   No other Florida inmate has survived as many death warrants and
only one other prisoner has been on Florida's death row longer.
   ``I know Willie Darden is innocent. It is not a belief; it is a
knowledge,'' said Ms. Bass, who said her attempts to give vital
information to Darden's trial attorney 14 years ago were rebuffed.
   Gov. Bob Martinez refused to meet with the two, and an aide said
the governor is satisfied that the evidence Sparks and Ms. Bass
were talking about had been considered and rejected by the courts.
   ``This is not about public sentiment. It's about the law and
carrying out the law,'' press secretary Jon Peck said in explaining
why Martinez decided against the meeting.
   ``I think a lot of people in Florida are wondering why he won't
sit down for even 15 minutes with Ms. Bass and me. That seems
reasonable,'' Sparks said at the news conference.
   Sparks and Ms. Bass, who have signed affidavits that raise
questions about whether Darden could have committed the crime, have
appeared on television news programs to repeat those statements.
   Supporters say Darden, who is black, was the victim of racial
prejudice in his trial.
   He was convicted of killing Lakeland store owner James Turman
during a robbery that netted $15. A store employee also was shot
and permanently disabled, while Turman's wife had to fend off a
sexual attack as her husband lay dying.
   Sparks said Turman's wife had told him that all blacks looked
alike to her and that her identification of Darden was unimportant
because the lawyers had told her that Darden committed the crime.
   Helen Baum, formerly Helen Turman, recently denied having made
that statement to Sparks and reaffirmed her identification of
Darden as the man who shot her husband.
   Ms. Bass, a Lakeland secretary, said Darden's car had broke down
near her home, and he waited for a tow truck from 4 p.m. to 5:35
p.m. on Sept. 8, 1973. Her house was eight miles from the furniture
store. Prosecutors say the crime occurred about 6 p.m.
   As Ms. Bass and Sparks made their claims, a sixth warrant
against Darden was stayed and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
consider his appeal for the fourth time.
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Darden had
received a fair trial and had been properly sentenced.
   The governor siged a seventh death warrant Tuesday, which gave
the inmate's attorneys less than a week to prepare his case.
Usually, at least 30 days are allowed.
   Amnesty International officials said Martinez was rushing to
execute Darden for political reasons.
   ``I think what the governor is looking for some kind of
ritualistic sacrifice that he can go through to prove he's tough on
crime,'' said Magdaleno Rose-Avila, national director of Amnesty
International's campaign to abolish the death penalty.
   She said the governor's popularity waned after the controversy
last year over a state sales tax on services. The governor
originally backed the tax but later repudiated it.
   Peck, the governor's spokesman, said politics had no bearing on
the new death warrant.
   Peck said Martinez had instituted a new policy recently to
schedule executions on subsequent warrants within 20 days, rather
than 30 days, which he said would have put the execution near the
Good Friday and Easter holidays.
   ``It seemed like kind of an inappropriate time,'' Peck said.
   Darden attorney Mark Olive said he wasn't sure when he would
file an execution appeal.
   When Martinez signed the sixth death warrant in Darden's case
earlier this year, Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, American
actress Margot Kidder and British rock star Peter Gabriel urged
clemency for Darden.
   Darden, 54, has been on death row since Jan. 29, 1974. A
prolific writer, he is nicknamed the ``poet of death row.''

<HEAD>Smaller Silhouette, Revival of Pants Highlight Fashion Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEONORA DODSWORTH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's big league stylists said Friday that
five days of presentations of deluxe ready-to-wear clothes for next
fall and winter went better than expected.
   Strong trends such as the new, smaller silhouette and a revival
of pants caught the interest of the fashion traders in Milan.
Revitalized classics coupled with the high quality Italian fabrics
and workmanship contributed to the success.
   Fear of the low buying power of the dollar had caused the
Italians to step carefully. The result was a simplified silhouette
with plenty of commercially valid, wearable clothes.
   Rigid cost control and the use of less opulent materials by some
fashion companies kept price tags within reasonable limits. Fashion
houses reported price increases of never more than 10 percent above
last year's prices.
   Jitters regarding competition from avant-garde foreign designers
_ the French in particular _ also showed signs of subsiding as
orders rolled in.
   The general good health of Italian fashion houses is
demonstrated by their continuous expansion into profitable market
sectors outside their ready-to-wear lines. Perfumes, furs,
eyeglasses, footwear, pens and watches are just some of the
sidelines that stylists sign to promote their name and make money.
   Perhaps the most successful part of the Milan shows was the
renewed interest in pants.
   ``Pants are what it's all about,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, senior
vice president-fashion director at Bloomingdales.
   Sal Ruggiero, fashion director at Marshall Field and Company of
Chicago, called them ``a great option'' until skirt lengths settle
down.
   Armani, Mario Valentino and Krizia showed them in easy-fitting
versions. Ferre, Versace and Genny preferred a tighter look.
   Pants frequently were cut high to emphasize the waist.
   The new tiny jacket, cropped at the waist and with tight-fitting
sleeves, is a keynote of the well-bred trend. Equally important is
the tailored city coat modeled on riding jacket lines, flaring out
from a fitted top.
   Armani showed a winner in Glen plaid and then repeated it in
velvet for a formal evening. Chalk-stripe gray flannel was the
fabric choice used by other designers for this shape.
   On the same refined wavelength are the Dickensian-style frock
coats shown by Romeo Gigli, one of Italy's youngest designers in
the top slot. He continues to use his favorite knit fabrics for
styles that fit as tight as a second skin, a habit copied by many
of his colleagues.
   Lots of boots, clinging tight as stockings, came in flat- or
high-heeled versions and heralded a return of the footwear after
several seasons.
   Fake furs enjoyed another revival. Fendi, Byblos and Armani for
Emporio produced some of the most beautiful.
   Many of the biggest names in Italian fashion will participate in
``Moda Italia,'' in New York. The show promoted by the Italian
Trade Commission will run from March 31 to April 17 in New York and
then move to other cities.

<TEXT>
   Prince Charles today said he and
others in his party knew the risks of skiing off marked trails
before an avalanche killed a companion and injured another in a
``whirling maelstrom.''
   In a statement read to reporters shortly before the royal party
flew from Zurich airport to London, Prince Charles said:
   ``I would like to emphazise that all members of my party,
including myself, were skiing off the piste (trail) at our own risk
and we all accepted ... that the mountains have to be treated with
the greatest respect and not treated lightly.''
   The handwritten statement, read by a press spokesman, also
described Thursday's tragedy in the mountains near the alpine
resort of Klosters.
   The snow slide missed the prince but killed a close friend, army
Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34. Another friend, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson,
was knocked unconscious and suffered fractures of both legs.
   ``When the avalanche started, with a trememdous roaring, Bruno
Sprechter (a guide), Charles Palmer-Tomkinson, the Swiss policeman
and myself all managed by a great good fortune to ski to one side.
   ``To my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson just
failed to ski clear and were swept away in a whirling maelstrom as
the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past us to the valley
below,'' the prince said.
   ``It was all over in a terrifying matter of seconds,'' the
prince said.
   Charles, his wife, Diana, and sister-in-law, the Duchess of
York, landed at Northolt, a Royal Air Force base 11 miles west of
London, this afternoon aboard a Queen's Flight aircraft after a
1{-hour from Zurich. The plane carried Lindsay's coffin.
   Lindsay's pregnant widow, Sarah, was at Northolt when the royal
party, wearing black, arrived. The 34-year-old press officer at
Buckingham Palace watched from a VIP lounge as eight officers from
her husband's Royal Lancers regiment carried the coffin from the
aircraft.
   She is expecting her first baby in May.
   Earlier today, a doctor said Charles' quick rescue efforts
helped save the life of Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson, who was buried under
the snowslide with Lindsay.
   Elsa Rauch, a doctor who was flown to the scene, said Charles
and others dug out Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson.
   ``They were so fast that they dug her out in a few minutes and I
would say they saved her life,'' she told the BBC. ``He (Charles)
helped to dig her out with his own hands. He was very controlled.
He talked to the lady.''
   Witnesses said Charles was distraught, in tears and trembling
when a helicopter came to take him away from the scene.
   British newspapers clamored today for Charles and other royals
to abandon dangerous pursuits.
   ``Charles is the next king. ... That means he must be ...
safeguarded, if need be from himself,'' the Daily Mirror admonished
in an editorial.
   The loose snow cascaded down as Charles, 39, and five companions
were skiing at about 5,800 feet in an area that was off the main
skiing trails. Authorities earlier in the day had warned it was
prone to avalanches.
   Diana and the duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, were safe in a
chalet when the avalanche struck. Sarah is married to Charles'
younger brother, Prince Andrew, and is expecting the couple's first
child in August.
   Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson regained consciousness after
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the scene. A helicopter took her to
Davos, where she underwent surgery for multiple fractures of both
legs and was reported in satisfactory condition this morning in a
hospital intensive care unit.
   It was the royal family's worst accident since Prince William of
Gloucester, a cousin of the Queen, died when his sports plane
crashed during an air race in 1972.
   Lindsay, a former aide of the queen, was a close friend of
Charles and Diana, who attended his high-society wedding last July.
He frequently accompanied the royal couple on the annual ski
holiday.
   The Palmer-Tomkinsons also vacation with Charles and Diana
annually at Klosters.

<HEAD>Vietnam's Premier Dies of Heart Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's Premier Pham Hung, who joined
the communist movement when he was 16 and played a key role in
defeating the United States in the Vietnam War, has died of a heart
attack. He was 75.
   The domestic Vietnamese radio, quoting official communiques,
said Hung died early Thursday afternoon ``while working in Ho Chi
Minh City (formerly Saigon) and other southern provinces.''
   It said the Council of Ministers named a vice premier, Vo Van
Kiet, as acting premier until the national assembly chooses a
permanent successor.
   Kiet, in his late 70s, is chairman of the State Planning
Commission and is regarded by Western analysts as the leading
proponent of Western-style reforms aimed at resolving the country's
economic crisis.
   Hung was a member of the ``old guard,'' a small group of
revolutionaries who took up radical politics in their teens, joined
the Communist Party in the 1930s and over the next half-century
guided it to victory over the French, Japanese and Americans.
   Some Western diplomats say that in recent years, Hung had been
in bad health and did not have a central role in important policy
decisions.
   His death was the latest in a series of recent major upheavals
in the Vietnamese leadership.
   Party chief Le Duan died in mid-1986. His successor, Truong
Chinh, and two other top party officials resigned in December 1986,
when the Sixth National Party Congress elevated more pragmatic
party officials to positions of power.
   In June 1987, Hung replaced Pham Van Dong, who had been premier
since 1955.
   The radio said that ``in the last minute of his life, Comrade
Pham Hung ... has closed his eyes like a combatant who has fallen
in the battlefield.''
   The broadcast announced three days of national mourning, from
Sunday to Tuesday, when the funeral will be held.
   Hung was born on June 11, 1912 in Vinh Long province, now called
Cuu Long province, in the Mekong River Delta of southern Vietnam.
   At the age of 16, he declared himself a radical, his activities
eventually leading to his expulsion from secondary school.
   He joined the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, the year it
was founded by Ho Chi Minh. The following year, Hung was arrested
by French authorities and sentenced to death.
   After the penalty was commuted, Hung spent the next decade and a
half in hard labor at the notorious prison island of Poulo Condore.
   Hung was released when communist forces came to power in North
Vietnam in 1945 and spent the next nine years of the war against
the French in key party positions in South Vietnam.
   After the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, Hung rose rapidly in
party and government ranks and returned to North Vietnam. He
entered the Politburo in 1956 and two years later became vice
premier of North Vietnam.
   Hung played key roles in the 1960-75 war against the U.S.-backed
government of South Vietnam. He was sent south in 1967 as secretary
of the South Vietnam Commission of the party's central committee
and as political commissar of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed
Forces, commonly known as the Viet Cong.
   In 1975, he served as the political commissar of the Ho Chi Minh
Campaign, the final North Vietnamese offensive which climaxed with
the capture of Saigon on April 30.
   He became a vice premier in 1976, and in 1980 was named Interior
Minister, a powerful post that deals with internal security. At the
December 1986 party congress, he moved up to the No. 2 slot in the
party Politburo, behind the newly-chosen party general secretary,
Nguyen Van Linh.
   In 1987, he was replaced as Interior Minister in a major
government reshuffle. That June, the national assembly named Hung
to replace Dong, a veteran diplomat who was the only premier
communist Vietnam had ever had.
   Given his age and conservative reputation, Western diplomats
said Hung probably was elevated as a ``transitional'' figure who
would pave the way for younger technocrats to preside over economic
reforms.

<TEXT>
   The National Assembly on Friday extended a
state of emergency invoked Feb. 26 during post-election riots in
the capital of this western African nation.
   The violence broke out after the announcement that Senegalese
President Abdou Diouf, of the Socialist Party, had won re-election
to a second five-year term. Police waged running battles with
stone-throwing protesters, and city businesses and homes of
governing party officials were damaged.
   Diouf's chief opponent, Abdoulaye Wade, of the Senegalese
Democratic Party, was charged by the government Wednesday with 12
other opposition leaders in connection with the violence.
   Diouf's party holds 103 of 120 seats in the assembly. Under
Senegalese law, the president is required to gain its approval to
extend the state of emergency.
   Senegal has a democratic tradition with 17 political parties and
a press that often criticizes the government.

   Women who enter a public restroom have a
legal right to expect the same privacy they have in their homes or
offices, the state Superior Court ruled.
   The court rejected claims by a man convicted on felony trespass
charges after he entered the ladies' room of the Society Hill Club.
His attorney contended that Anthony White should have been found
guilty only of ``defiant trespass,'' a misdemeanor, because the
club was open to public access and, therefore, so were all
restrooms.
   ``We deem the ladies' room to be a separately secured or
occupied portion of the structure housing the Society Hill Club,''
the said Wednesday in upholding the felony trespass finding of a
lower court.
   ``The trial court stated that the criminal trespass statute
gives legal protection to the expectation of privacy that the
occupants of the smaller units (within a structure or building)
would realistically assume. The court concluded that the
legislature intended to afford occupants of a restroom the same
protection afforded occupants of an office.''
   In other words, ``All women in the restroom may exclude all men,
even those legitimately in the club,'' the court added.
   An aerobics instructor was alone in the restroom when White
entered it, according to the court. White rifled through the
contents of the woman's gym bag, made indecent propositions to her
and used obscene language and gestures, the court said.
   White was sentenced to 1{ to three years in prison after being
convicted of felony trespass and attempted robbery in Philadelphia
Common Pleas Court in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 6,000 political activists have
been imprisoned since the opposition launched its anti-government
campaign last October, it was reported Friday.
   Holiday, an independent English-language weekly, said that about
6,000 people were ``languishing'' in jails.
   Home Secretary Kamaluddin Choudhury denied the report and said
the figure was too high.
   ``Most of the political prisoners arrested in recent months have
been freed,'' he said.
   Choudhury, however, declined to say how many activists were in
jail.
   Bangladesh's top opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina and Khaleda
Zia, claim that more than 10,000 people have been detained by the
security forces since late October.
   The women have been spearheading an opposition campaign to oust
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, a former army general who seized
power in a bloodless coup in 1982. Their parties, the Awami League
and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, boycotted the March 3
parliamentary elections along with other major opposition groups.
   Ershad's Jatiya Party gained a majority in the polls.
   The opposition parties will observe March 16 as ``Release the
Detainees Day'' to pressure the government to release the political
workers, most of whom are being held under the Special Powers Act.
The Act allows imprisonment for one month without the filing of
formal charges.

<HEAD>Coroner Says Gibb Died of Heart Condition</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with hospital saying death
caused by inflammed heart. Pick up 4th graf pvs: ``There was...''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pop singer Andy Gibb died of an inflamed heart
caused most likely by a virus, not drug or alcohol abuse, doctors
said today.
   The Oxford coroner's office said an autopsy showed that Gibb,
30, died naturally of a heart condition.
   The statements came after Bee Gees singer Robin Gibb angrily
denied reports that his brother's death was related to drug abuse.
   Constable Michael Harvey of the Oxford coroner's office said
that since the cause of death was natural, an inquest would not be
conducted.
   ``Mr. Gibb died from inflammation of the heart of the sort
commonly caused by a virus. There is no evidence that his death was
related to drink or drugs,'' said a statement from the John
Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where the singer died Thursday.
   Gibb had followed his brothers, who formed the Bee Gees rock
group, to stardom in the late 1970s.
   ``There was no question of Andy using drugs. I don't know where
that story came from, but there is absolutely no truth in it. He
was not using cocaine again,'' Robin Gibb told reporters at
Heathrow Airport. British tabloids had said drug abuse may have
caused the death.
   ``It was so unexpected,'' he said. ``Andy had been ill with
stomach pains for about four days.''
   Robin Gibb, 39, was at the airport to meet his 72-year-old
father, Hughie, who was arriving from Los Angeles.
   Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said Gibb
was admitted to John Radcliffe Hospital on Monday, discharged, and
readmitted Wednesday night after complaining of stomach pains.
   A hospital spokesman said the two-time Grammy Award nominee died
at 8:45 a.m. Thursday in the hospital, 50 miles northwest of London.
   In 1982, Gibb acknowledged he became heavily involved in drugs
and dropped his career after the break-up of his highly publicized
relationship with television star Victoria Principal.
   Three years later, he entered the Betty Ford Rehabilitation
Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., for treatment of a cocaine habit.
   A spokesman for Island Records Ltd., who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Gibb signed a contract two months ago and would
have started working on a new album this spring.
   Gibb, who at times sang in a falsetto voice, had a string of
hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His chart-toppers included
``I Just Want To Be Your Everything,'' ``Love Is Thicker Than
Water,'' ``Shadow Dancing,'' ``Everlasting Love,'' and ``Our Love
(Don't Throw It All Away).''
   Despite his successful solo career, Gibb never fully emerged
from the shadow of his older superstar brothers, Maurice, Robin and
Barry, who formed the Bee Gees. Last year, Gibb went into
bankruptcy proceedings in Miami, where he had been living.
   But his Miami lawyer, John Kozyak, said Gibb's bankruptcy was
discharged in January, his debts were settled, and he ``was back on
his feet and in good spirits and trying to put together a record
contract.''
   Gibb was divorced from his wife, Kim, in 1978. The couple had
one child, a daughter, Peta, 12.
   In addition to his singing career, Gibb had a stint as a co-host
on TV's ``Solid Gold,'' the syndicated musical variety show, but he
was fired in 1982 for missing too many tapings.
   Chronic absenteeism also cost Gibb the title role of the
Broadway musical ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.''
After opening Dec. 1, 1982 to generally favorable notices, Gibb was
fired the following month for missing 12 performances.

<HEAD>President Tells Superpowers To Lay Off Central America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Oscar Arias, winner of the
1987 Nobel Peace prize for his Central American peace plan, said
the United States and Soviet Union should give the region a chance
to work out its problems on its own.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Arias said he also
has urged President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to include Central America as a topic in their next summit.
   Stressing that the purpose of his peace plan was to ``build
bridges,'' Arias said he had received indications from both United
States and Soviet Union that the superpowers will discuss the issue.
   ``I went to the U.S. Congress to ask congressmen to give us
Central Americans an opportunity to work out our problems,'' Arias
said in the interview, conducted Thursday. ``But I cannot do the
same thing in the Soviet Union because of the nature of its regime,
radically different from the pluralistic democracy system of the
West.''
   Arias said he was pleased that Nicaragua's Contra rebels had
agreed to meet with Nicaraguan government representatives inside
that country and without a mediator for cease-fire talks. Previous
peace talks have been held outside the country and were mediated by
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic bishop.
   Arias described a Nicaraguan cease-fire as the ``key ... that
would then open other possibilities'' for peace.
   But he expressed regrets that the Soviet Union continued to
provide aid to leftist guerrilla movements in Central America.
   ``I cannot use the Soviet Union's media and ask its government
to give us the same chance I requested from the U.S. Congress. I
see where the Soviet Union continues to help guerrilla movements in
Central America and, in the last few months, as never before, is
helping the Sandinista governemnt militarily,'' he added.
   The war in Nicaragua is one of the Central American conflicts
that Arias hopes will be resolved as a result of his peace plan,
which also seeks to end guerrilla wars in El Salvador and Honduras,
bring democracy to the entire region, and end foreign aid to
insurgents.
   The presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and
Guatemala joined Arias in signing the plan last August.
   Arias said that if the United States and Soviet Union include
Central America's armed conflicts in their summit agenda, ``it
would be very important for us to show between now and then that
some progress has been made toward reaching a regional political
solution.''
   ``We have an opportunity, as never before, to find peace in
Central America,'' Arias said. ``If we do not, those who come after
us will feel less of a commitment to search for it.''
   Arias said a problem with making the peace plan work has been a
lack of consistency between what is being said and done.
   ``There can be no peace without democracy in our region. They
must go hand in hand,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group formed by the Church of Scientology has
filed five medical malpractice lawsuits in Massachusetts against
physicians who prescribed the drug Ritalin to children to control
supposed hyperactivity.
   The Citizens Commission for Human Rights claims Ritalin is
dangerous and over-prescribed.
   The maker of the drug, not named in any of the suits, denied all
the group's claims Friday.
   Dennis Clarke, president of the commission that was formed in
1969, read aloud from medical and psychiatric journals to back up
the group's claims when the group announced the suits Thursday with
attorneys and two mothers who are plaintiffs. The suits do not
request specific damages.
   Too often, Clarke said, teachers and school officials complain
that a child is too active and suggest to parents that the child be
taken to a pediatrician who recommends Ritalin without careful
examination.
   Clarke said Ritalin use requires increased dosage over time.
Withdrawal results in depression and can sometimes result in
suicidal behavior, he claimed. He also cited medical journals in
his claim that Ritalin has been shown to cause psychotic episodes
in children.
   Such claims were all denied Friday by Ciba-Geigy Corp.
spokeswoman Gloria Martini in Summit, N.J., who said she has never
seen in medical journals any of the claims Clarke cited.
   ``Ritalin has been out there for over 30 years and it has a long
history of experience for physicians who use it,'' Mrs. Martini
said. ``There is no evidence that it is addictive when used as
directed.''
   She said it has a potential for abuse, however.
   Ciba-Geigy introduced Ritalin to the U.S. market in 1955. In
1987 it was used by an estimated 600,000 to 700,000 patients, Mrs.
Martini said.
   Clarke said he spoke briefly to attorneys representing Rod
Matthews, the 15-year-old Canton boy convicted of second-degree
murder in the bludgeoning a classmate with a baseball bat.
Matthews' attorneys claimed the teen-ager had been taking Ritalin
and that it may have triggered the violent episode.
   Susan Marshall of Hingham, mother of a child placed on Ritalin
and a plaintiff in one of the suits, said Ritalin was prescribed
for her ``normal, happy, well-adjusted'' son when he began to have
slight handwriting problems in the first grade.
   ``I was not given any diagnosis, I was never told about any side
effects,'' said Mrs. Marshall.
   Her son took the drug for six months and became angry, hostile,
moody and stopped eating most meals, she said. A neurologist later
discovered his problem stemmed from slight brain damage.
   Rita Lassiter of New Bedford said her son, Matthew, was first
described as ``too active'' by his kindergarten teachers and was
given Ritalin after a 10-minute examination by a pediatrician.
   Bernard Portnoy, who prescribed the drug for Matthew Lassiter,
said he was unaware of the lawsuit against him.
   Of Ritalin, he said, ``I think it can be of help when it's used
properly. It can be helpful in many cases.''
   Mrs. Lassiter said Matthew's condition worsened after taking the
drug but said she did not make the connection until a few years
later. When Matthew was taken off the drug, he became so
disoriented and troubled that he had to be hospitalized. Now 11, he
is unable to attend school, his vision is blurred and his growth is
stunted, Mrs. Lassiter said.

   A former top aide to Gov. Evan Mecham
testified today that he believed the governor was loyal to a state
official accused of making a death threat because the man had been
an effective campaign fund-raiser.
   Former special assistant Sam Steiger, who faces a criminal
extortion charge unrelated to Mecham's case, testified at the
governor's impeachment trial that Mecham has a ``dangerous tendency
of extreme loyalty'' to people who have helped him.
   Mecham felt such loyalty toward Lee Watkins, who is accused of
making a death threat against former Mecham aide Donna Carlson,
Steiger said. Ms. Carlson was about to testify before a grand jury
investigating the governor's campaign finances.
   Mecham is accused of trying to thwart an investigation of the
alleged threat.
   During Thursday's testimony, Mecham's defense lawyer angered
senators by accusing the Senate majority leader of showing
``overwhelming'' bias against the governor during his impeachment
trial.
   Jerris Leonard lashed out at Majority Leader Bob Usdane when the
Republican lawmaker questioned whether the impeached governor's new
lawyers erred when they said weeks ago they were ready to defend
Mecham.
   Usdane ``ought to show a little more impartiality,'' said
Leonard. ``His bias and prejudice are overwhelming,'' and under
normal trial circumstances he should be disqualified, the attorney
said.
   For months, Usdane has been accused by some lawmakers of being
too accommodating toward Mecham's GOP administration.
   Leonard's attack came during testimony on an accusation that
Mecham tried to block an investigation of an alleged death threat
by a state official. Testimony on that charge was expected to
continue today.
   Usdane called the lawyer's blast ``ill-conceived.''
   ``I don't think I'm biased,'' the majority leader added. ``I
swore an oath to go (make a decision) based on the evidence and
that's what I'll go on.''
   Minority Leader Alan Stephens also took issue with Leonard's
statement.
   ``Maybe they figured they've lost their case, and are going to
go one by one trying to create controversy,'' Stephens said. ``If
that's so, we're all in for a very unpleasant time.''
   The controversy arose when Usdane challenged Leonard's
contention that he should be allowed to question a witness on
matters not specified earlier because there had not been enough
time to prepare for trial.
   The senator asked whether that countered an affidavit by
Mecham's new lawyers certifiying they were ready shortly before the
trial began Feb. 29.
   Leonard joined Mecham's defense team a week before the trial
opened, and the governor's original defense lawyer resigned three
days later.
   Mecham, 63, is also accused of concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan and misusing $80,000 from a state protocol fund by loaning it
to his auto dealership. He faces an April 21 criminal trial on
charges of hiding the $350,000 loan, and a May 17 recall election.
   The governor is accused of ordering Department of Public Safety
Director Ralph Milstead not to cooperate with a probe of the
alleged threat last November against Ms. Carlson, a former Mecham
aide about to testify before a grand jury about the $350,000 loan.
   Peggy Griffith, head of the Governor's Office of Women's
Services, testified last week that Watkins, then the state prison
construction chief, threatened Ms. Carlson's life during the second
of two conversations Nov. 12.
   The defense sought Thursday to discredit Mrs. Griffith with
testimony from her secretary, Terri Fields, who said her boss
``tends to exaggerate things a little'' and was not thorough in her
work.
   When asked for an example of an exaggeration by Mrs. Griffith,
Ms. Fields said she could not think of one. Ms. Fields testified
she did not believe the second conversation between Mrs. Griffith
and Watkins ever happened.
   ``Maybe she did have the conversation with Lee Watkins, but I
don't believe that a threat came out of it,'' Ms. Fields said.
   Ray Russell, the only one of Mecham's original special
assistants still on his staff a year after the governor took
office, testified that administration officials felt that ``every
time you turned around it looked like somebody was investigating us
for breaking the law.''
   ``I know what's in his (Mecham's) heart,'' Russell said. ``I
find him to be an honest, sincere man.''
   Mecham is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades
and the first ever in Arizona. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member
Senate is required for a conviction that could bar him from ever
holding public office again.

   Favorite son Jesse Jackson, looking for a
warm homecoming in South Carolina in Saturday's Democratic
caucuses, said today ``it's get out the vote time'' in the state
that gave him one of his few 1984 wins.
   Jackson told about 250 supporters at the University of South
Carolina that the new challenge for the South is to ``find common
ground where the people can come together.''
   Most political experts and campaign officials in the state
agreed that Jackson was the clear front-runner in the caucuses.
   There's more suspense over how close Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. can come to Jackson and the division of delegates, 44 of which
are at stake Saturday.
   South Carolina's Democratic leaders decided against following
the crowd on Super Tuesday, when all of the other Southern states
held primaries.
   The candidates are relying on grass-roots organizing, telephone
banks and direct mail to lure Democrats to the caucus; Gore is also
buying television advertisements.
   Gore, who was campaigning in Greenville, Columbia and Charleston
today, has the largest organization in the state and the most
endorsements from elected officials, who wield strong influence at
the caucuses.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who traveled across the state
Wednesday and Thursday, has a skeletal organization. But his few
endorsements from elected officials are the biggest _ former Govs.
Dick Riley and Robert McNair and all of the South Carolina
Democratic congressmen who have chosen sides.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has an even smaller local
organization and virtually no endorsements from elected officials.
   But Dukakis' strong Super Tuesday showing will help earn him a
chunk of votes Saturday, Barry Weiner, Dukakis' national campaign
co-chairman, said Thursday in Columbia.
   All of the competing state campaigns except Gore's have conceded
that Jackson will win the lion's share of the 44 delegates at stake.
   ``I don't think there is any doubt that Jesse Jackson will
win,'' said Bill Prince, Gephardt's state coordinator.
   House Speaker Robert Sheheen, Gore's state chairman, said
``there's really no way of knowing'' whether the Tennessee senator
can upset Jackson. ``We're not conceding anything to anybody.''
   Gore is promoting his strong ties to the South and a strong
defense, which plays well in the Palmetto State.
   Gephardt is hoping to use his trade policy to gain votes in the
state, which has seen its largest industry _ textiles _ severely
weakened by cheap foreign imports. His first stop Wednesday was a
textile plant in Aiken County that is scheduled to close next month
and put 420 people out of work.
   Between a quarter and a half of South Carolina Democrats
traditionally remain uncommitted at the caucus meetings to give
themselves more maneuvering room through the nominating process.
They usually choose a candidate at the county or state convention.
   That leaves relatively few delegates for the candidates to
divide up Saturday. But in a tight national race in which no
candidate has been able to take a decisive lead, every one helps.
   ``This certainly increases the importance of South Carolina
because the delegate count is so close,'' said Kevin Gray, state
coordinator for Jackson.

   Thailand's envoy urged the United States on
Friday not to cut quotas for Indochinese refugees to make room for
Armenians fleeing the Soviet Union.
   If more Armenians are permitted into the United States the
quotas for Eastern Europe should be raised and the quotas for
Indochina should be left alone, Ambassador Arsa Sarasin told a news
conference.
   The U.S. budget currently permits the annual entry of 68,500
refugees from around the world, including 23,000 from Indochina.
Thailand, where 400,000 Indochinese refugees reside, mostly in
camps, is pressing continuously for higher quotas.
   ``The United States must not cut the quota and give it to
Eastern Europe,' Sarasin said.
   The Reagan administration is in the process of deciding what to
do about a massive increase in applications for entry from
residents of Soviet Armenia.
   According to State Department records, Armenians are applying
for asylum at a rate of 1,500 a month, compared with 200 applicants
in all of 1985 and 200 to 300 a month as recently as 1987. Up to
12,000 Armenians are reportedly waiting to come to the United
States.
   A current wave of ethnic protests in Armenia has highlighted
some of the dissatisfaction there toward Soviet government policies
in the region.
   Sarasin said he felt better about the situation after Jonathan
Moore, director of the State Department's division of refugee
affairs, told a congressional hearing Feb. 24 that no decision to
alter quotas had been made.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
however that changes were possible under some of the options being
considered by an interagency group.
   The group may decide to reallocate quotas, grant emergency
quotas for the Armenians, or slow down processing of refugees to
pay for the influx from Armenia.
   Relations between the United States and Thailand have been in a
somewhat sour state lately, mostly because of the refugee problem.
After years of providing asylum to people fleeing Cambodia, Vietnam
and Laos, resistance is growing in Thailand to the continuing
influx.
   Leaders there have accused the United States, Australia, Canada
and other resettlement countries of failing to live up to
commitments to find new homes for the refugees.
   ``Thailand cannot bear the burden indefinitely,'' Sarasin said.
``There is a limit to our capacity.''
   Moore and other U.S. officials have been sympathetic to
Thailand's concerns and have sought higher refugee quotas. At the
same time, they have criticized inhumane treatment of refugees in
Thailand.
   Such treatment has included the closing of some camps, the
pushing of boats laden with refugees out to sea and the forced
repatriation of Lao tribesmen seeking a haven in Thailand.

   The captain of a Continental Airlines
flight that crashed last November, killing 28 people and injuring
54, generally performed well when he was tested on a DC-9, a flight
trainer testified today at a federal hearing.
   However, the co-pilot, First Officer Lee Bruecher, 26, was at
the controls of Continental Flight 1713 when it crashed at Denver's
Stapleton International Airport on Nov. 15. Both the pilot and
co-pilot were killed.
   On Thursday, a different flight trainer testified that Bruecher
had trouble with takeoffs and landings during his simulator
training on the DC-9.
   In testimony today before National Transportation Safety Board
officials investigating the accident, Continental Capt. James
Edward Madsen said Capt. Frank Zvonek did a good job on a test ride
from Denver to Albuquerque, N.M., but he did not give himself as
long a final approach as Madsen would have liked and did not allow
enough visual clearance behind a small aircraft.
   ``I would have given myself another mile or two of spacing,''
said Madsen, but added, ``It was not a down or unsatisfactory
flight at all.''
   Continental pilot trainer J.E. Summerville's testimony Thursday
about Bruecher's performance highlighted the third day of the
four-day NTSB hearing. The board is trying to identify factors that
caused the DC-9 to crash moments after takeoff.
   Bruecher was a good student but had problems with takeoffs and
landings, and Summerville once had to ``freeze'' the training
simulator to avoid a crash during a practice landing, he said
Thursday.
   Bruecher ``had trouble controlling altitude and airspeed within
reasonable limits,'' Summerville wrote, and repeated one course of
the seven-part flight simulator training.
   However, at the conclusion of the training, Summerville said, he
recommended Bruecher for the Federal Aviation Administration
proficiency test needed to fly a specific kind of airplane.
   Bruecher finished a proficiency check on Sept. 14, 1987, with
another instructor who graded his performance ``average'' and began
his initial operating experience as a line pilot with Continental
on Oct. 2. At the time of the crash, he had only 36 hours piloting
DC-9s, NTSB investigators have said.
   Zvonek had 198 hours on a DC-9 with only the previous 33 hours
as captain.
   NTSB officials on Thursday also questioned Capt. Dave Dickerson,
manager of Continental's DC-9 program at Houston, about training
procedures. Dickerson said he saw no correlation between Bruecher's
level of experience and the problems he experienced.
   De-icing was another subject of testimony.
   Summerville said he instructs pilots during training to
re-evaluate the condition of their aircraft if 20 minutes or more
elapse between the time the plane is de-iced and takeoff.
   ``I tell them to look at the parts you can see from the cockpit,
including the nose, the windshield wipers, unheated windows and any
aircraft around you.''
   Depending on the weather conditions, Summerville said, he
sometimes would advise pilots to go into the cabin and look out at
the wings. ``But we all know that's not the best way to look to see
if you've got ice on the wings.'' A mechanic's inspection at the
gate would be better, he said.
   Earlier testimony showed that a mixup by air traffic officials
delayed Flight 1713's takeoff by minutes, but no conclusions were
drawn on whether that had any role in the crash.
   Also under investigation is the possibility that a wing vortex,
or swirling wind triggered by another plane's wing moving through
the air, could have contributed to the crash.

   If they can't have the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart,
Riverfront Coliseum officials say Bruce Springsteen will do. But
their offer may be too late.
   After Swaggart's last-minute cancellation, coliseum officials
are trying to book the singer March 24-26.
   Springsteen's agents previously had asked about those dates, but
he was turned away because of the Swaggart booking made a year
earlier.
   Now, however, Springsteen is booked March 26 in Lexington, Ky.,
and chances of getting him to make a Cincinnati stop are limited,
said Rich Neumann, vice president for marketing at Riverfront
Coliseum.
   ``We have approached them about playing us the 25th and
Lexington the 26th. We are guardedly optimistic,'' Neumann said
Thursday.
   Swaggart's agents canceled his engagement two weeks ago, after
disclosures of his alleged misconduct and admission of an
unspecified sin. The television preacher faces disciplinary action
by the national Assemblies of God for allegedly meeting with a
reputed prostitute in suburban New Orleans.

   Sandra Gubin, an American woman who
championed the cause of Soviets seeking to join their spouses in
the United States, has been divorced from her Soviet husband.
   District Judge Kenneth Bronson agreed with her contention that
Aleksei Lodisev married her solely to enter the United States.
   ``The defendant's entire testimony is shot through with
evasiveness and contradictions,'' said Bronson.
   Gubin and Lodisev were married in the Soviet Union in 1981,
while Gubin was studying in Kiev. She returned to the United States
and spent several years trying to get an exit visa for Lodisev.
   She became a spokeswoman for the Divided Spouse Coalition, a
group of Americans whose spouses have been denied exit visas.
   In January 1986, Lodisev arrived in New York. Eleven months
later, Gubin filed for divorce, saying he married her only to come
to the United States.
   Gubin was awarded $113,087 for lost wages, expenses for writing
to political figures and medical expenses. ``There is scant
likelihood of collection on the judgment,'' because of debts
pending against Lodisev, Bronson said in his ruling Tuesday.
   Lodisev's lawyer, Craig McKinnon, said he was unsure whether his
client wanted to appeal. Lodisev, who works for a computer company,
had no comment.
   Gubin, a doctoral student in political science at the University
of Michigan, said she felt vindicated, but sorry for Lodisev.

   Former astronaut James Irwin, who
made six unsuccessful trips to Turkey in search of Noah's Ark, has
begun searching for the Egyptian chariots swallowed by the Red Sea
when the Israelites fled Egypt.
   According to the Book of Exodus in the Old Testament, God parted
the Red Sea for the fleeing Israelites, then drowned the pursuing
Egyptians.
   Irwin, his wife, Mary, and three other Coloradans accompanied an
international team that spent about $250,000 and most of February
retracing the Israelites' steps. They spent a week diving
unsuccessfully for evidence of the Biblical episode.
   ``The purpose of the whole expedition was to retrace the Exodus
route from the region of Cairo to the real Mount Sinai,'' Irwin
said Thursday.
   Irwin said no date has been set for another expedition.
   Irwin, a member of the Apollo 15 crew who walked on the moon in
1971, searched Mount Ararat six times between 1982 and 1987 without
finding evidence of Noah's Ark.

   Elizabeth Taylor, a five-time divorcee,
has been named Ex-Spouse of the Year for bouncing back from years
of ``sulking and feeling sorry for herself.''
   Last year's winner of the Ex-Spouse of the Year was talk show
host Johnny Carson, who has been divorced three times.
   The Rev. Roger Coleman, who has launched a nationwide campaign
to observe April 1 as the second annual Ex-Spouses Day, said Friday
that Ms. Taylor ``is a symbol of broken relationships ... and made
such a comeback.''
   Coleman, a Disciples of Christ minister with the Community
Christian Church in Kansas City, has been divorced once. He said he
has mailed packets of information to 7,500 singles organizations
across the country.
   Coleman said that although there is an element of humor in
Ex-Spouses Day, he's also seeking more responsible behavior between
spouses ``so the children can be taken better care of.''
   Coleman said he chose Ms. Taylor because, ``For many years she
seemed to be sulking and feeling sorry for herself, but now she is
making contributions to society,'' such as fund-raising for AIDS
research.

   A truck driver surrendered to police
this morning after he stormed into his estranged wife's home and
fired six blasts from a shotgun, then jackknifed his rig on a busy
freeway, authorities said.
   One shot was fired a short time before the incident ended about
7:25 a.m., but police said it was not aimed at them and nobody was
injured.
   Ronald Stone, 34, was taken to Solano County Jail to be booked
for investigation of attempted murder, according to police Lt. Gary
Mallory.
   It was a replay of a similar incident from a decade ago,
according to police Chief Gary Tatum, who said Stone then held off
police with a gun in a domestic dispute and spent some time in jail
as a result.
   The truck driver had threatened to shoot anyone who approached,
police said. Officers from three agencies surrounded the section of
Interstate 80 where Stone sat in the vehicle with ``lots of
ammunition,'' said Mallory.
   A special weapons and tactics unit from the police department,
California Highway Patrol officers and Solano County sheriff's
deputies rushed to the area.
   ``He has a 12-gauge shotgun and he fired six rounds while at his
wife's home, four inside and two outside,'' Mallory said.
   Tatum said Jackie Stone first called police at 12:46 a.m. to
report her husband was at the door and appeared to be drunk. By the
time officers arrived, he was gone.
   Tatum said they received a second call about half an hour later
saying Stone had returned.
   Stone, who separated from his wife about a month ago, kicked in
the front door of the house.
   After telling the couple's three children it was time for their
mother ``and him to die,'' Stone began beating his wife, Mallory
said.
   His mother-in-law and the children fled from the house, and
Stone's wife managed to escape soon after, police said.
   When officers arrived, Stone threatened to kill himself, holding
the shotgun beneath his chin with a finger poised on the trigger,
Mallory said.
   Finally, he leaped into his unmarked tractor-trailer rig and,
with police pursuing, headed for the freeway, the officer said.
There, Stone jackknifed the truck, leaving the cab stuck in the
median and the trailer jutting into traffic.
   Police talked with Stone, first by CB radio and then, after he
stopped, via a field telephone tossed into the cab.
   After firing a final blast out the window of the truck, Stone
gave up. He suffered minor powder burns from the shotgun, but was
otherwise unhurt.
   The highway patrol closed the freeway in both directions,
jamming one of the main arteries leading to the San Francisco Bay
area and the state capital in Sacramento.

   Jesse Jackson finished first in
Alaska's Democratic precinct caucuses, posting a narrow victory
over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in a nonbinding preference
poll announced today.
   With about 90 percent of Alaska's 442 precincts reporting,
Jackson claimed 872 delegates, or 35 percent of the total, to
Dukakis' 769 delegates, or 31 percent.
   A close third, however, were 768 delegates, or 31 percent, who
were uncommitted.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. finished a distant fourth, with
47 delegates or 2 percent, followed by Illinois Sen. Paul Simon
with 18 delegates, less than 1 percent, and Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt, 16 delegates for less than 1 percent.
   Henry Lancaster, statewide coordinator for the Jackson campaign,
said that with blacks comprising just 3 percent of Alaska's
population, his candidate's appeal came from the anti-drug and
economic issues he's been voicing around the nation.
   ``This state has a lot of working-class people who've come from
the South, the Midwest and the Northwest,'' Lancaster said. ``In
down times, people are looking for solutions. And this is a down
time.''
   That reference was to the collapse of Alaska's oil-fired
economy. About 85 percent of the state's budget is supported by oil
revenues, and world oil prices are less than half what they were
three years ago.
   The Democrats chose 2,496 delegates in caucuses around the state
Thursday night. The caucuses were open to any registered Democrat
and anyone who wished to register at the door.
   The precinct delegates selected Thursday will meet at 27
district caucuses on April 9-10. They will select 390 delegates to
attend the state convention in Fairbanks on May 13-15.
   None of the delegates chosen before the state convention is
bound to a particular candidate.
   The 12 delegates emerging from the state convention will attend
the national convention in Atlanta in July. Those delegates will be
bound to a specific candidate for at least the first ballot.

   Democrat Gary Hart dropped out of the
presidential campaign today, saying ``I got a fair hearing and the
people have decided,'' as Republicans Bob Dole and Pat Robertson
vowed to stay in the race.
   Hart left the campaign last May after disclosure of his
relationship with model Donna Rice but then rejoined it in
December, declaring, ``Let the people decide.''
   Today in Denver, as he withdrew again, he said the people had
had their say: ``Clearly I should not go forward.''
   Hart failed to win any delegates in the primaries and caucuses,
polled no more than 5 percent of the vote in any of the Super
Tuesday primaries and lost his eligibility for further federal
matching funds.
   ``My friends and supporters have given the word `loyalty' new
meaning,'' he said. ``They've toiled tirelessly in an uphill
fight.''
   Dole said today in remarks to Illinois Farm Bureau leaders, ``I
want to make certain you understand I am in this race.'' Press
reports had noted he had taken his television ads off the air in
Illinois and had drastically cut his campaign staff after being
beaten by Vice President George Bush in 16 Super Tuesday contests.
   Noting those reports, he said today, ``It's hard to focus on the
issues sometimes because the press won't let us do that. They would
rather write about how many staff you reduced your numbers by. I
never thought that a campaign was a jobs program.''
   In Peoria, Robertson said, ``I'm in it until New Orleans (site
of the Republican National Convention). It looks overwhelming for
one of the Republican candidates, but Goliath was pretty
overwhelming as well. We're going to win.''
   Five days before the Illinois primary, Democratic candidates
participated in a televised forum Thursday night, but in contrast
to many of their joint appearances, not a cross word was exchanged.
   It was ``all sweetness and light,'' said Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon after the forum sponsored by WLS-TV and the Roosevelt Center
for American Policy Studies.
   Simon greeted people eating breakfast today at the Golden Nugget
Pancake House on the North Side of Chicago and predicted the
Democratic convention would need at least two ballots to choose its
presidential nominee.
   ``I think I have as good a chance as anyone,'' he said.
   Then Simon stopped by the Polish National Alliance where he
received the endorsement of the Polish Daily Zgoda, a Polish
language newspaper.
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll published today but conducted
Wednesday, the day after the Super Tuesday primaries and six days
before Illinois votes, said Vice President George Bush had the
support of 58 percent of Republicans.
   On the Democratic side, Simon was backed by 38 percent of the
likely voters surveyed and Chicago-based Jesse Jackson had support
of 33 percent. The figures for Simon and Jackson were well within
the 8 percentage point margin of error.
   In Alaska, Democratic officials said today that Jackson finished
first in the state's precinct caucuses, posting a narrow victory
over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in a nonbinding preference
poll, 34.9 percent to 31 percent.
   Uncommitted caucus delegates ran a close third, with the other
candidates far behind.
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York ended his presidential bid on
Thursday and said the idea of being the Republican candidate for
vice president was ``a very flattering and awesome thought.''
   Kemp declined to endorse any of the surviving candidates _ Bush,
Dole and Pat Robertson _ describing them all as ``Reagan
conservatives.''
   Dole scotched rumors that he was about to join Kemp on the
campaign sidelines.
   ``Bob Dole's no dropout,'' he said in a statement issued in
Washington and Illinois. ``I'm in this one to win.''
   Bush beat Dole in all 16 Super Tuesday primaries and now has 705
national convention delegates compared to 165 for the Kansas
senator.
   Dole did not say whether he would remain in the race if he loses
to Bush in Illinois but an aide said, ``I think it's clear to Dole
that it's do or die.''
   Dole canceled all television commercials in Illinois and ordered
deep layoffs in his staff. An aide said the campaign was
considering airing a 30-minute paid broadcast in the closing hours
of the campaign.
   One bright spot for the Kansas senator was the endorsement of
the Chicago Tribune which said that Bush's identification with
President Reagan, while a big help in Republican primary contests,
might be a handicap in the general election.
   ``Nowhere have the Republican candidates asked or answered the
kind of harsh questions the Democrats surely will raise in November
about the Reagan administration, whose colors Mr. Bush has been
able to wave more furiously than anyone else,'' the newspaper said
in an editorial headlined, ``Why Illinois Should Pick Dole.''
   Robertson, who also had a disappointing day on Super Tuesday,
also ordered deep staff cuts.
   ``We want to stay lean and mean,'' he said, declining to give
the number of employees laid off.
   The vice president also was campaigning in the state in advance
of Tuesday's primary. Illinois voters will elect delegates and also
express their preferences in a beauty contest on the ballot.
   Bush told a Governors Club luncheon in Chicago that he was
``tired of being embarrassed'' by scandals involving government
officials and he called for establishment of a White House ethics
panel.
   Bush has refused, however, to criticize any administration
officials, including Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who have
come under investigation by grand juries.

<DATELINE>PIERRE, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A snowstorm caused South Dakota Democrats to
postpone a statewide caucus called for Saturday, when the party was
to decide how to apportion 15 of the state's national convention
delegates.
   ``It's a quality snowstorm,'' said Rick Hauffe, acting director
of the South Dakota Democratic Party. ``It really dumped.''
   The Friday storm was expected to leave from 4 to 18 inches of
snow across the state.
   Hauffe said the caucus has been rescheduled for March 19.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt won the state's Democratic
primary on Feb. 23, but national party rules would not permit the
election to have any directly binding effect on the national
convention delegates.
   The dispute with the national party centered on the timing of
the primary, which came two weeks earlier than allowed by national
party rules.
   The statewide caucus, meeting within the time allowed by the
national rules, was to decide whether to allocate the delegates
among the presidential candidates in proportion to the primary
results. Under the rules, the caucus is free to use the primary
results or reject them entirely, basing the allocation instead on
the presidential preferences of the people attending the caucus.
   If the caucus decides to use the primary results, only Gephardt
and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis would qualify for any
delegates.
   Based on the primary results, Gephardt would receive nine pedged
delegates to the Democratic National Convention and Dukakis would
get six, party officials have said.

   A close aide to President Suharto was
sworn in as vice president Friday despite opposition from the
parliament's Moslem faction and some members of the military.
   State Secretary Sudharmono was elected to the post earlier in
the day, hours after Suharto was sworn in for a fifth five-year
term. The five factions of the People's Consultative Assembly
reached a consensus to elect Sudharmono after the Moslem United
Development Party dropped its candidate, party chairman Jailani
Naro.
   The decision to withdraw Naro's candidacy came after Suharto
named the 61-year-old Sudharmono as his choice for vice president
in a meeting with the assembly leadership.
   Sudharmono was formally nominated by the governing GOLKAR party,
an acronym for the Indonesian words ``Golongan Karya'' or
functional group. He was also supported by the assembly's
government-nominated military faction, the government-nominated
provincial faction and the nationalist Christian Indonesian
Democratic Party faction.
   Suharto, 66, reportedly told GOLKAR members last month that the
next vice president should be able to lead the nation should the
president become incapacitated.
   Military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said some
members of the army had opposed his nomination. They supported
instead the newly appointed armed forces commander, Gen. Try
Sutrisno, 52, a popular figure and a former Suharto aide.
   An army general took to the podium following Suharto's
re-election Thursday to protest nominating procedures for the vice
president.
   ``We Indonesian soldiers who believe in God and defend honesty
and justice have heard rumors that the nomination of the vice
president is not being fairly and correctly carried out,'' said
Brig. Gen. Ibrahim Saleh, an assembly member from the
government-nominated military faction.
   ``There are certain things that we feel are against our
consience,'' said Saleh, who was escorted out by assembly officials
before he could finish his statement.
   Sudharmono, a retired army lieutenant general, is a military
lawyer by training. He became one of the country's leading
bureaucrats after years of government apprenticeship, first under
the late President Sukarno and then as a founding member of the
Suharto administration.
   Addressing the parliament after he was sworn in, Sudharmono said
an ability to work closely with the president was of extreme
importance.
   ``I extend my deepest gratitude to President Suharto for giving
me this honor and trust to work with him in the coming five
years,'' he said.

   Authorities broadcast warnings Friday to Tibetan
rebels to turn themselves in by March 20 or face punishment,
according to a Western source in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa.
   The source, a Tibetan-speaking traveler, said vans with
loudspeakers were driving through the city every hour repeating the
same message.
   Police with machine guns, meanwhile, remained posted in front of
the city's holiest temple, the sprawling, white-washed Jokhang
Temple, and on the roofs of nearby buildings, Western tourists
said. It was at the Jokhang that last weekend's riots began.
   ``They're warning people to do their duty, report troublemakers.
They'll be rewarded if they give information,'' the
Tibetan-speaking traveler said in a telephone interview from
Beijing.
   She said one announcement called ``for people to surrender _
people who were involved in the disturbances _ before the 20th,
otherwise they would be punished.''
   Thousands of Tibetans demanding independence from China stoned
police and set bonfires throughout Lhasa last Saturday in a day of
violence triggered when one Buddhist monk stood up at a prayer
festival and began shouting anti-Chinese slogans.
   Official reports said one Chinese police officer and one Tibetan
were killed. However, an American traveler in Lhasa who saw some of
the violence said Tibetans estimate 21 Tibetans and three police
were killed.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said a hero's funeral was held
Friday in Lhasa for the dead policeman, 21-year-old Yuan Shisheng,
who was stabbed and thrown out of a second-story window. It said
more than 2,500 mourners attended.
   The Hong Kong branch of the China News Service, also an official
mainland agency, reported that a local Tibetan civil and religious
official and two 18-year-old Tibetans were arrested Wednesday. The
brief report said they were accused of taking part in violent
anti-Chinese protests in October.
   At least 14 people were killed in the largest of those protests,
when thousands of Tibetans stoned and burned a police station on
Oct. 1.
   The China News Service report did not say why the three were
arrested only now. It was the first official report of any arrests
since the March 5 uprising.
   Unofficial reports of wide-scale arrests continued to filter out
of Lhasa. Estimates ranged up to 1,000, but none of the figures
could be confirmed. Authorities have refused to allow foreign
reporters to visit Lhasa this week and have halted sales of plane
tickets to Lhasa to all foreigners.
   The approximately one dozen foreign travelers in Lhasa have been
virtually the only source of information on events in the remote
mile-high city surrounded by mountains.
   An ethnic Tibetan from Nepal who left Lhasa on Friday said
police came to his uncle's house several times in recent days,
making house-to-house checks for suspects.
   The Western woman reported 10 arrests among the families of her
Tibetan acquaintances. She said the Tibetans reported police
dragged suspects from their homes in the middle of the night,
beating them.
   She said she had stopped visiting Tibetan friends for fear of
drawing police attention to them.
   She said it was ``almost impossible'' to telephone outside of
Lhasa, and interrupted the interview several times to say, ``People
here (running the hotel) are getting very nervous'' about her
conversation.
   Trucks carrying armed police also drove through the city Friday,
but in smaller convoys than earlier in the week, the foreigners
reported.
   On Wednesday and Thursday, one American said he counted more
than 100 trucks, each carrying 20 to 30 police, driving in a parade
through the city in a show of force.
   Even under normal circumstances, Tibet is a heavily militarized
region because of its long border with India, with which China has
clashed several times. Large police and military installations rim
the capital city of about 150,000 people, and some Western experts
estimate there is one Chinese soldier for every 10 Tibetans.
   China claims Tibet has been part of its empire since the 13th
century. However, the remote region was effectively ruled for much
of that time by the Buddhist monasteries and the Dalai Lama, whom
Tibetans regard as a reincarnation of their protector god.
   The current Dalai Lama, regarded as the 14th in a line of
reincarnations, fled to India in 1959, nine years after Chinese
Communist troops entered Tibet. His flight was triggered by a
massive anti-Chinese uprising in which thousands of Tibetans were
killed.

<HEAD>Greek-Turkish Relations Apparently in U.S.-Greek Base Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Athens has linked its improving relations
with Turkey to its talks with the United States on military bases
in Greece, a government spokesman said Friday.
   Greece and the United States ended their fourth round of
negotiations on a new agreement to replace one expiring in December.
   ``The talks were also dedicated this time to the exchange of
views between the two sides on issues of principle that have been
put forward by the Greek government,'' said spokesman Sotiris
Kostopoulos.
   Kostopoulos apparently was referring to Greek demands linking a
new accord to progress on Greek-Turkish problems.
   Relations between the two neighboring allies have been steadily
improving since Premier Andreas Papandreou's recent meetings with
Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal. Greece and Turkey have
quarreled over Aegean airspace and seabed rights.
   The United States has said it wants to avoid regional politics
in the bilateral base negotiations.
   There are four U.S. bases in Greece: two near Athens and two on
the southern island of Crete. Greece receives more than $300
million a year in military credits as payment.
   More negotiations are scheduled in Athens next month and in
Washington in May.

<TEXT>
   Strong winds and unseasonably warm
temperatures whittled a 70-year-old musher's lead in the 1,150-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race to a matter of minutes, according to
standings this morning.
   At last report, Joe Redington, known as the ``Father of the
Iditarod'' because he helped organize the first race 16 years ago,
still was on the trail between Cripple and Sulatna Crossing today,
the seventh day of the race.
   It's only 47 miles between the two checkpoints, and the length
of time it was taking Redington to cover the distance was a
reflection of the weather. Normally, Iditarod teams average 8-10
mph.
   All 50 dog teams in the race from Anchorage to Nome were slowed
Thursday by temperatures that climbed into the 40s, turning the
trail soggy and overheating the cold-loving huskies who pull the
sleds.
   Redington waited 11 hours after reaching Cripple for more
favorable weather, and by the time he decided to move, second-place
Herbie Nayokpuk decided his team was rested enough to push on.
   Nayokpuk, known as the Shishmaref Cannonball, had arrived in
Cripple more than six hours behind Redington, but he left at 3:20
p.m., only five minutes after the leader.
   In third place was Martin Buser of Big Lake, who pulled into
Cripple at 2:50 p.m. He was followed by four-time Iditarod champion
Rick Swenson of Two Rivers at 3:20 p.m.; Joe Garnie of Teller at
3:22 p.m.; and defending champion Susan Butcher of Manley at 4:35
p.m.
   Redington, who arrived in Cripple, 525 miles from the start, at
4:50 a.m., tried leaving at 9 a.m. Thursday, but the sun-softened
snow turned him around.
   ``No use to fight that. Let it harden up a little bit,'' he said
just before leaving Thursday afternoon. ``The dogs were right up to
their bellies, going along about 4 to 5 miles an hour. I went out
about three miles and came back. Thought I'd wait a while.''
   The delay gave an advantage to teams that have been hounding
Redington since he took the lead 260 miles back in Rohn, but he
said there was little choice, given the soft trail.
   ``It doesn't hurt to give the dogs a little more rest,'' he said.
   From Cripple, the trail heads to Ruby, on the Yukon River, then
follows the frozen river to Kaltag and cuts over to Unalakleet on
the Bering Sea coast.
   The first musher to reach Nome will win $30,000. The next 19
finishers will split the rest of a $150,000 purse.
   Two teams have dropped out of the race, and two of the more than
800 dogs running have died, race officials said. Both deaths were
ruled accidental.

<HEAD>Top U.S. Officials Get Presents Ranging from Edible to Incredible</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Having friends in high places brought in a
load of booty last year for top U.S. government officials, who
collected $232,404 in presents that ranged from the edible to the
incredible.
   When Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to Washington to
sign an arms treaty in December, he brought 35 ounces of Russian
black caviar for President Reagan, worth $875.
   From West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Reagan received a $300
case of German wine; from Canadian Governor General Jeanne Suave, a
$10 bottle of maple syrup; and from King Hassan of Morocco, ``a
large basket of delicacies and foodstuffs'' with a price tag of
$100.
   First lady Nancy Reagan was given two enlarged photogrphs, taken
by a French satellite, of the Reagans' ranch in California's Santa
Ynez mountains. That and other gifts came from French Prime
Minister Jacques Chirac. Value: $1,500.
   Among other gifts from foreign officials, which were listed by
the State Department in Friday's Federal Register, was an AK-47
automatic rifle, ``with separate box of ammunition,'' given to
former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger by Chinese Gen. Yang
Shangkun.
   Secretary of State George Shultz's wife, Helena, was given a $20
``horse tail fly whisk'' by women from the Cameroon People's
Democratic Movement.
   And Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is being pressured by the
United States to step down as Panama's military ruler, sent a dozen
bottles of champagne worth $285 to the U.S. Army Southern Command
at Fort Clayton, Panama, last July 4.
   Edible gifts, like the syrup and the caviar, can be consumed by
the recipients. Less expensive items also can be kept, but federal
law requires that anything worth more than $180 be turned over to
the government to go into a museum or to be auctioned off. In many
cases, the gifts can be retained ``for official use'' in the
offices of the recipient.
   In each case, the gifts were accepted because ``refusal would
have caused embarrassment to donor and U.S. government,'' the State
Department said.
   The Reagans received a total of $81,178 in presents, the most
expensive of which was a $12,600 crystal bowl and platter from
Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson.
   Knowing of Mrs. Reagan's fondness for smart clothes, Semra Ozal,
wife of the Turkish prime miniser, gave the first lady a brown
leather dress with black velvet and gold bead decorations, a
matching fur-trimmed leather jacket and a black leather evening
suit, also trimmed with fur. The outfits were valued at $700.
   The prime minister, Turgut Ozal, gave the president a pair of
carved-wood walking sticks decorated with silver-colored metal and
bearing pictures of the Reagans. They were valued at $120.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir gave the Reagans a
calligraphic sculpture forming the Hebrew letters resh and nun,
which spell the word ``Ron'' phonetically and also stand for the
Hebrew characters for ``Ronald'' and ``Nancy.'' It was worth an
estimated $750.
   Many of the gifts were in some way identified with the donor
nation. African countries tended to give handmade craft items,
Middle Eastern countries often gave rugs, and some foreign leaders
gave pictures of themselves.
   At least one gift couldn't be appraised. Reagan was given a
stone launched by the Romans in the first-century seige of Masada,
in southern Israel, which Israeli President Chaim Herzog had
encased in lucite and mounted on black marble.
   Vice President George Bush reported receiving a pair of $4,475
``gyro-stabilized binoculars'' from Jordan's Gen. Zeid Bin Shaker
and a $5,700 set of Olympic commemorative coins from former South
Korean President Chun Doo-Hwan. Bush got his own caviar from
Gorbachev as well, 35 ounces also valued at $875.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas received from
Gorbachev a black lacquer box, worth $300 to $500, that was
decorated with a picture of Moscow. Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., was
given a pair of unappraised elephant tusks by President Hissene
Habre of Chad. And Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and two aides
received watches and cuff links worth a total of $8,500 from the
amir of Bahrain.
   CIA Director William Webster got a long list of items, ranging
from a $350 Indo-Persian silk wall hanging to a gold Egyptian
ceremonial sword worth $1,000. The identity of the donors was
deemed too sensitive to be disclosed.

<HEAD>Marine Fitness Campaign Just Got a Little Tougher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps, already renowned for its
rigorous physical conditioning, is about to make things tougher for
those who have already made it through basic training.
   A new training policy order, signed last week and now being
prepared for distribution to the field, will require all commands
to refocus their physical conditioning program so that it goes
beyond just staying in shape to pass the standard physical fitness
test.
   Among other things, all Marines are going to be expected to
start lifting weights or to engage in some equivalent type of
``progressive resistance training'' such as ``isometric exercises
or partner resistance exercises.''
   The new directive was signed by Brig. Gen. F.E. Sisley, the
corps' deputy chief of staff for training, but was really prompted
by Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr., the man who took over as the corps'
commandant last July.
   Gray, a stocky, tobacco-chewing general who rose through the
ranks by staying away from the Pentagon, complained shortly after
arriving in Washington he was sick and tired of seeing his Marines
jogging for exercise ``in cute little sneaks.''
   Marine headquarters ``looks like a morgue'' every afternoon
because everyone is out jogging to ``look nice,'' Gray added.
   ``I think if we would run a little more each day we'd be the
best looking outfit ever to get run off a hill.''
   Reflecting that philosophy, the new directive states:
``Historically, the purpose of many Physical Conditioning Programs
has been to prepare Marines for fitness testing, rather than
training them for the physical rigors of combat.
   ``The focus, therefore, of our programs must change. Each
commander must emphasize unit and combat fitness training, (instead
of) physical fitness testing, and reflect this distinction in
training plans and schedules.''
   The directive makes it clear the corps is not changing its
standard physical fitness test, which all Marines must pass at
least once every six months. That test requires Marines to meet
standards for a 3-mile run and performing sit-ups and pullups.
   Rather, the directive says commanders must ensure their Marines
face ``a minimum program of three hours per week'' of exercises
that can be divided between anaerobic conditioning, progressive
resistance training and aerobic conditioning.
   Anaerobic conditioning would include calisthenics and other
exercises ``to increase speed, flexibility and agility,'' while
aerobic includes running and any exercise that ``enhances
cardiovascular endurance.''
   Weight-lifting will fulfill the requirement for progressive
resistance training and is needed because of the ``correlation of
muscular strength and endurance to success in combat operations,''
the directive states.
   Moreover, when a Marine is finished with his regular physical
conditioning, his commander should make sure he gets some
``occupational conditioning,'' the directive continues.
   A Marine who is schooled as an infantryman, for example, should
face some ``progressive load-bearing marches, dry net training,
swimming, obstacle courses, confidence courses, etc.,'' the
directive says.
   And once the Marine is done with his occupational training, his
commander should include some ``competitive conditioning activities
... to foster competitive attitudes.''
   However, the directive does warn the commander to keep in mind
``the stark truth of the saying, `No enemy has ever been killed by
a basketball.'''
   The overall objective, the directive concludes, ``is to develop
in Marines a reserve level of physical fitness that will enhance
their chances of winning in a combat situation.''

<HEAD>Private College Group Urges Reagan to Sign Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private college group urged President Reagan
on Friday to sign the Civil Rights Restoration Act, even though the
act fails to include a broad exemption for religious schools.
   Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, said his organization was
the main proponent of efforts that failed in the House to add a
so-called religious tenet amendment to the bill.
   But the association of 800 private institutions, including
Catholic and other religious-affiliated colleges, still wants
Reagan to sign the bill, which restores the scope of civil rights
laws restricted by the Supreme Court in a 1984 case involving Grove
City (Pa.) College.
   Rosser, in a letter to Reagan, said it was made clear during the
House debate that the legislative intent of the new bill is ``to
give deferential treatment to requests for religious exemption
under Title IX.''
   ``As the lead organization seeking passage of a religious tenet
amendment ... we hope that the religious liberty concerns we
articulated can be addressed by the Congress at a future time,''
Rosser said.
   ``We want to reiterate our unqualified support for this
legislation,'' he added.
   Reagan has repeatedly threatened to veto the legislation, which
was passed by margins of 75-14 in the Senate and 315-98 in the
House _ easily enough to override a veto.
   The Senate approved the bill last month after adding an
amendment that says nothing in the bill or existing law requires
any institution to perform or pay for abortions.
   The House passed the bill March 2 despite a written warning from
Reagan that he would veto it ``if it is presented to me in its
current form.''
   He said then it ``dramatically expands the scope of federal
jurisdiction over state and local governments and the private
sector'' and ``poses a particular threat to religious liberty.''
   The restoration act specifies that entire institutions and
government agencies are covered by federal laws protecting the
civil rights of women, minorities, the handicapped and the elderly
if any program or activity within the institutions receives federal
aid.
   The bill exempts farmers getting crop subsidies, people on food
stamps and others receiving federal assistance.

<HEAD>Delegate Races, Not ``Beauty Contest'' Important in Illinois</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Sen. Paul Simon asked local
supporters this week to cast nine votes for him in Illinois'
Democratic primary, it wasn't an incitement to vote fraud.
   Simon's plea reflected Illinois' two-part presidential ballot: a
non-binding ``beauty contest'' preference vote and dozens of local
races for the Democratic and Republican delegate slots that are the
real prize on Tuesday.
   Unlike many states in which delegates are apportioned on the
basis of a statewide vote, Illinois' delegates are elected directly
by voters in congressional district races.
   It's a key feature of the political terrain for presidential
candidates in Illinois, offering advantages to Simon, George Bush
and Bob Dole and posing daunting problems for others, political
obervers say.
   The 82 Republican and 113 Democratic delegate slots to be filled
Tuesday are apportioned among the state's 22 congressional
districts on the basis of relative strength in previous primaries.
   For example, in the heavily Democratic 1st District on Chicago's
South Side, Democratic voters will select nine delegates and three
alternates, while Republicans will choose two delegates and two
alternates.
   Recruiting delegate-candidates is a key organizational hurdle
for the presidential campaigns. Without backers on the delegate
ballot, a candidate can't translate Illinois support into
convention votes.
   The system is further complicted this year by the crowded
presidential field, leaving voters in some areas to choose among as
many as 70 delegate candidates.
   ``I am asking for nine votes,'' Simon told backers at a
Springfield fund-raiser on Wednesday. ``Six for delegates, two for
alternates and one for that beauty contest. All nine votes are
important.''
   Simon's political roots in Illinois gave him an edge in
recruiting well-known delegate-candidates with a voter appeal of
their own. His slates are studded with state legislators, labor
leaders and party activists.
   ``Basically, we looked for people that have well-known names or
would bring in a supporting group: a labor-union leader, a person
from nuclear freeze, an elected official or party leader,'' said
Mike Kreloff, Simon's Illinois delegate coordinator.
   ``They'll help him hold off (Michael) Dukakis, but their impact
is minimized by the fact that the presidential candidate's name
appears on the ballot'' alongside the delegate-candidates, said
Steve Copple, Jesse Jackson's national delegate coordinator. ``The
bulk of the people are going to vote for their presidential
candidates' supporters.''
   Illinois' delegate selection system is a handicap for Jackson,
whose stronghold is three predominantly black districts in Chicago.
Those districts will elect 24 of the 113 Democratic delegates, but
his chances of success elsewhere are questionable.
   Simon's other Democratic foes had little success in recruiting
big names, and only he and Dukakis have full slates in every
district. Albert Gore has no supporters on the ballot in three
districts and Richard Gephardt is short of a full slate in five
districts.
   Even favorite son Jackson has no delegate slate in the heavily
Republican 12th District, and is short of a full slate in three
other districts.
   ``We were looking for people who had a fundamental commitment to
Al Gore and his philosophy,'' said Larry Perlman, who runs the Gore
campaign in Illinois. ``That meant we didn't get a lot of people
who have been around party politics for a long time.''
   On the GOP side, Bush and Dole both assembled impressive slates
with the help of their state chairmen, Gov. James R. Thompson and
Illinois House Republican Leader Lee Daniels. Pat Robertson also
has a full slate in every district, but virtually all of his
candidates are political unknowns.
   Bush operatives acknowledge that well-known Dole
delegate-candidates such as former Gov. Richard Ogilvie and former
U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb might help Dole revive his candidacy
   ``I don't think name recognition alone is going to win for the
delegates,'' said Ed Murnane, deputy director of Bush's Illinois
campaign. ``But in the really close, tight races, that's where name
recognition probably does have some impact.''

<TEXT>
   Half the Arab policemen in
the West Bank resigned by PLO order Friday and Israeli soldiers
closed the main Gaza mosque on the Moslem sabbath for the first
time worshipers could remember.
   The Al Amari mosque in Gaza City has been a rallying point for
protest since riots began Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, with prayer leaders sometimes calling over its loudspeakers
for resistance to the army.
   Israeli troopers shot and wounded nine Palestinians during
street battles after Friday prayers at other mosques in the
occupied territories. The army demolished the homes of four Arabs
accused of attacking either Israelis or Palestinians accused of
collaborating with them.
   Two alleged collaborators have been killed by fellow Arabs, one
of them a policemen. Israeli bullets or beatings have killed at
least 87 Palestinians in more than three months of violence, and
hundreds have been wounded.
   Army units turned journalists away from Hebron and Nablus but
the press restriction was not as widespread as on March 4, when
nearly all the West Bank was put off-limits.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir made his first public criticism of
new U.S. peace proposals Secretary of State George P. Shultz
brought to the region, declaring: ``The only word I agree with in
the U.S. plan is the name Shultz.'' About half the 500 Arab police
officiers in the West Bank resigned in response to a call from the
Palestine Liberation Organization and underground United National
Command of the Uprising, sources reported. The order was given in a
leaflet circulated Thursday.
   Mustafa Adani, 44, said he resigned after 25 years on the force
along with ``almost all the police in the Bethlehem station, about
50 to 55. The only ones who didn't quit were those who didn't know
about the orders.''
   A senior military official said the resignations would have ``a
negative impact on other Palestinians who work with Israel in the
territories. It is not very encouraging.''
   Leaflet No. 10 also demanded the resignations of West Bank
residents who serve in Jordan's parliament, apparently to reinforce
the PLO role as the sole representative of Palestinians.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan, and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt, in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Soldiers wounded eight Palestinians, two of them seriously,
during riots Friday at a mosque in Beit Ummar, 10 miles south of
Jerusalem, according to officials at Beit Jallah and Mukassed
hospitals.
   The confrontation began when troopers tried to disperse Arabs
protesting outside the mosque. They fired tear gas and one canister
broke a window, falling inside the mosque, Arab witnesses said.
   Half a dozen soldiers entered the mosque during prayers to ask
the imam, or religious leader, to urge protesters on the mosque
loudspeaker to go home, the witnesses said.
   ``The soldiers entered the mosque while we were still kneeling
barefoot on our prayer rugs. People started shouting Allahu Akhbar
(God is Great),'' Youssef Hassan Khalil, 30, said at Mukassed
Hospital. He lay on a cot with a wounded right ankle.
   Witnesses said the presence of Israeli soldiers in the mosque
during prayers inflamed the Arabs, who hurled rocks and bottles and
received volleys of tear gas, rubber bullets and gunfire in return.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers wounded a Palestinian in the leg
while trying to disperse protesters at the Jabaliya refugee camp,
hospital officials said.
   An army cordon around Al Amari in Gaza prevented a weekly prayer
service that normally attracts 2,500 worshipers.
   Jerusalem's mufti, the ranking Moslem religious leader, issued a
statement accusing Israel of blocking some mosques, raiding others
and confiscating loudspeakers used to call Palestinian Moslems to
prayer.
   Sheik Said Adin Alami called on worshipers ``to defend the
mosques by all possible means despite the attackers.''
   The army said it demolished three Arab homes overnight in
Biddya, 30 miles northwest of Jerusalem, to punish Palestinians
accused of involvement in an attack March 5 on an Arab suspected of
cooperating with Israel.
   Soldiers also blew up the home in Hebron of Ahmed Mahmoud
Abdullah Kawasmeh, whose 22-year-old son is accused of knifing an
Israeli settler from nearby Kiryat Arba five months ago.
   Israeli troops have destroyed 14 Palestinian homes since Dec. 8,
the Arab-run Palestine Press Service said.

   The Rhode Island Supreme Court on Friday
refused to block efforts to get a deposition from a priest
regarding talks he had with another pastor later convicted of
sexually molesting young boys.
   The Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence is being sued for $12
million by a Narragansett woman and her son who contend the diocese
knew the Rev. William C. O'Connell was molesting boys but did
nothing about it. As a result, the suit contends, the boy became
one of O'Connell's victims.
   The family's attorney, R. Daniel Prentiss, has been trying to
take a deposition from the Rev. Richard C. Bucci. But Bishop Louis
E. Gelineau and Auxiliary Bishop Kenneth A. Angell, named as
defendants in the suit with O'Connell, argued any conversations
between Bucci and O'Connell are privileged.
   The diocese contended the discussions are protected by a state
law that prohibits a priest from testifying about ``confidential
communication entrusted to him in his professional capacity.''
   Prentiss contended the state law is intended to prevent a priest
from divulging what he is told in confession.
   ``My interpretation was that a statutory privilege absolutely
does not apply and cannot be used to silence a witness the way they
were trying here,'' Prentiss said Friday.
   Monday, a Superior Court judge denied the diocese's request to
permanently block the deposition, but granted church attorneys a
temporary stay pending a Supreme Court appeal.
   Prentiss and diocese attorney William T. Murphy met in chambers
Friday with Supreme Court Associate Justice Florence K. Murray.
   ``About an hour later or less, I got a telephone call from the
court saying there was not going to be a stay of the deposition,''
Prentiss said.
   There was no elaboration on the decision, Prentiss said.
   He said Bucci is scheduled to give his deposition Monday.
   Murphy indicated he would not appeal the high court's decision.
   O'Connell was arrested in 1985 on charges of sexually assaulting
three boys. He was accused of fondling them in the rectory of St.
Mary's Church in Bristol and in his South Kingstown summer cottage
between 1982 and 1984.
   He pleaded no contest to 26 separate counts in 1986 _ seven of
them involving the plaintiff in the civil suit _ and was sentenced
to one year in jail. He also agreed to spend two years in therapy
at a church-run program for clergy members with alcohol and
psychological problems.
   The woman and her son contend the diocese and the bishops failed
to remove O'Connell from his position as pastor of St. Mary's after
being informed of his sexual involvement with boys, some of them
altar boys.
   Buccci, an assistant pastor at St. Mary's in 1984 and 1985, has
not publicly admitted discussing O'Connell's behavior with diocesan
officials. But he did file statements with police about O'Connell,
and he provided information to the state Department for Children
and Their Families.

<HEAD>Eradicating Polio The Goal For 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Forty million children in 34 countries
will be vaccinated in the next four years under a program to
eradicate polio in Latin America and the Caribbean, a doctor said
Friday.
   Dr. Ciro A. de Quadros, an adviser to the World Health
Organization, said governments in the region have committed $350
million to the project, which is expected to cost $450 million.
   The rest is to be donated by other groups such as the U.S.
Agency for International Development, UNICEF, WHO, and the private
Rotary International.
   Quadros spoke at a three-day meeting of development experts,
doctors and health ministers in this Alpine town. The conference is
sponsored by the Task Force for Child Survival, whose members
include UNICEF, WHO, the U.N. Development Program, the World Bank
and the Rockefeller Foundation.
   Quadros told the group that the polio campaign expects to reach
10 million of the 11 million children born in Latin America each
year between now and 1991. The goal is to reach 85 percent of the
children in every country in Latin America, either through
established health care systems or special immunization days.
   The campaign is an intensified version of a project already
under way.
   In Paraguay and the Dominican Republic, health workers have gone
door-to-door administering the oral polio vaccine. Nine countries
last year held special immunization days, including El Salvador,
where government troops and rebels called a one-day truce to allow
children to be immunized.
   ``We are four years away from wiping out polio and we are very
confident,'' Quadros said, adding that the incidence of the disease
is already low when compared to other childhood diseases.
   Fourteen Latin American countries last year reported about 900
cases of polio, he said, three times more than in Europe.
   The United States has been virtually free of the paralyzing
virus for a decade.
   ``So, the long-term goal of the polio project not just to wipe
out polio,'' Quadros said in an interview. ``It is to establish an
infrastucture, a health care system in developing countries that
can be used for other types of immunization and for delivering
other care.''
   In addition, success in fighting polio is expected to boost the
morale of health care workers and communities struggling against
the enormous medical problems that confront the impoverished Third
World.
   Dr. William H. Foege, executive director of the Task Force and
former head of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said
lessons learned in South America will be used to set a date for
eradicating the disease in Asia, Africa and elsewhere.
   Among those attending the meeting at a 16th century stone
monastery in the French Alps are World Bank President Barber
Conable, UNICEF Executive Director James P. Grant, WHO Director
General Halfdan Mahler, leaders of more than a dozen other
international aid agencies and health ministers from 11 countries.
   Since the early 1980s, Task Force organizations have been
cooperating to vaccinate children against diptheria, whooping
cough, tuberculosis and neonatal tetanus, in addition to polio. The
project, aimed at developing countries, has raised immunization
from 5 percent to 50 percent of the world's children in less than a
decade.

<HEAD>State Department Official Defends Nuclear Pact With Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior State Department official on Friday
defended an agreement giving Japan access to U.S. nuclear wastes
and disputed reports that negotiations with Congress to avert a
move to kill it had broken down.
   ``We're more than prepared to continue the discussions with the
Congress to see if there is a basis for moving forward on the
agreement,'' Fred McGoldrick, director of the Office of
Non-Proliferation and Export Policy, said.
   McGoldrick said the agreement concluded last November with Japan
and facing a disapproval vote next week in the Senate has adequate
safeguards against proliferation and terrorism.
   ``We think the agreement is very much in our interest,'`
McGoldrick said. ``If we do not have this kind of agreement, the
Japanese will simply go elsewhere to buy their enriched uranium.
That not only has commercial implications _ we would lose export
revenues _ it means we do not have nonproliferation controls and
influence that we have in this agreement.''
   Two former Pentagon officials and the congressional General
Accounting Office have been sharply critical of the pact, which
allows Japan to retrieve plutonium, the primary ingredient of
nuclear weapons, from U.S. nuclear fuel once the fuel has been used.
   Critics of the nuclear cooperation agreement said Thursday they
may move to kill the accord next week in Congress.
   The former Pentagon officials, Richard N. Perle and Frank J.
Gaffney Jr., said the Defense Department was not given a
significant role in negotiations and considers the agreement
``seriously flawed.''
   ``The strong position that the department has taken against
nuclear proliferation would have helped to shape the accord
differently,'' they said in a letter written to Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, and obtained by The Associated Press. ``That, we are quite
sure, is why the Department of State went to such lengths to work
around us.''
   Perle and Gaffney cited two provisions of the agreement as
``especially troublesome.'' First, they said, the pact gives Japan
advance U.S. consent for 30 years to reprocess and use American
plutonium in any Japanese facility without restriction on the
amount or the purpose.
   Second, they said, the pact ``imposes extraordinary and
unprecedented restrictions on the right of the United States to
suspend that prior consent.''
   Perle and Gaffney said they were the Pentagon officials
responsible for non-proliferation issues while the agreement was
negotiated.
   A GAO report, meanwhile, said the agreement would leave the
United States without ``effective control'' over reprocessing of
the hazardous material.
   The Feb. 29 report also found fault with the agreement's
provisions to guard against proliferation and said it deprived
Congress of its oversight function.
   Congressional opponents want the United States to have the right
to review Japanese use of plutonium on a case-by-case basis, and to
be able to suspend the agreement to counter terrorism threats or
address other national security concerns.
   The congressional foes also want the agreement to be reviewed
every five years.
   These changes would require renegotiating the terms with Japan,
which the State Department declines to do, said a congressional
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   McGoldrick said the United States has ``an unfettered right to
suspend our approval to use plutonium that would result in a
significant increase in the risk of proliferation or a threat to
the national security.''
   And, he said, the pact includes ``defined safeguards'' against
misuse of the plutonium.
   McGoldrick said Canada and Australia, which have strong
non-proliferation policies, have entered into similar agreements
with Japan and West European countries without case-by-case
restrictions.
   The GAO report said the agreement did not meet various
requirements of the Atomic Energy Act. It said giving blanket
approval to Japan for reprocessing plutonium ``would leave the
United States with no effective control over the life of the
proposed agreement.''
   In December, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 15-3
to return the pact to President Reagan and asked that it be
renegotiated. Opponents argued that it sets a precedent to
encourage potentially hazardous trade in plutonium, which is a
potent cancer-causing agent.
   Under the agreement, Japan would ship the spent nuclear fuel
from the United States to reprocessing plants in Britain or France,
which would separate plutonium from the waste. The plutonium then
would be shipped to Japan by air.

   Dogs that helped seize $135 million
worth of drugs in less than a year have enraged drug traffickers
who are offering $30,000 to anyone who kills the animals, federal
authorities say.
   The threats are aimed mostly at one dog, nicknamed Rocky, who
has become a sort of mascot in the fight against drugs and is used
in many drug awareness programs for children, according to Terry
McIntosh, deputy regional chief of the U.S. Border Patrol in Dallas.
   However, McIntosh said Wednesday, the threats made by telephone
a few months ago to the McAllen office cover all 14 dogs used by
the Border Patrol.
   ``The callers said they have put out the word they will pay to
have the dogs killed,'' McIntosh said.
   The dogs are stationed in McAllen and Laredo as well as in
Marfa, El Paso and Del Rio.
   McIntosh said the dogs have been guarded round the clock since
the threats.

   Informal meetings were held Friday in the
Afghanistan peace talks after what U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez
said was a week spent tackling ``enormous difficulties'' in the
proposed settlement to end nine years of fighting.
   He told reporters that he asked the Afghan and Pakistani
representatives to seek ``strengthened instructions'' for the next
session scheduled Monday in the indirect talks between the two
sides.
   This would be just one day before a March 15 target date set for
the negotiations by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last month. He
said Moscow would bring home its troops beginning May 15 if the
settlement was signed by March 15.
   However, sources close to the talks have said the date was not
meant as a deadline after which the Soviet pullout might be in
doubt.
   In Peshawar, Pakistan, meanwhile, a moderate faction that split
from the alliance of Moslem Afghan guerrillas last week rejoined
the alliance Friday.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddedi told members of his Afghan National
Liberation Front that assurances from other leaders and from
Pakistani officials persuaded him to rejoin the guerrillas' effort
to hammer out an interim government to oversee the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   Mojaddedi split with the alliance because he was worried that
Moslem extremists would dominate the interim government.
   In Geneva, Cordovez reiterated that agreement existed ``on the
substance of things.''
   The problem now concerns the sequence of actions in Afghanistan,
leading up to and including the withdrawal of the 115,000 Soviet
troops.
   It also hinges on Pakistan's insistence that an interim
government be ready to take control in Kabul before the Soviets
begin their withdrawal.
   Emerging with him from a closed-door meeting was the chief
Pakistani delegate, acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani, who said
the negotiations were ``inching slowly.''
   Pakistan's position about the interim government came under new
fire from the Soviet Union Thursday with Moscow's special envoy,
Nikolay Kozyrev, saying the talks had ``bogged down'' because of it.
   Kozyrev warned that Islamabad would bear the responsibility if
there was no final agreement despite completion of all the main
elements of the settlement.
   He also said that Moscow felt free to continue military
assistance to Afghanistan even after the troop withdrawal. He
rejected a U.S. demand that military aid should be cut off
simultaneously to both the Kabul government and the anti-communist
guerrillas. Kozyrev said assistance to the government was not
covered in the draft agreements.
   Sources close to the Pakistani delegation said the cut-off issue
was among items discussed with Cordovez at the informal meeting
Friday but they did not dsclose details.

   WASHINGTON _ President Reagan, stepping up U.S. economic
pressure on Panama, today ordered that a $6.5 million payment due
that country on Tuesday be put into escrow.
   The move was part of a series of sanctions designed to weaken
Panama's military-dominated government, which Reagan called
``illegitimate,'' and orce strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega from
power.
   Reagan called on Noriega to resign as commander of the
Panamanian Defense Forces and said in a statement that the United
States can no longer conduct business as usual with Noriega's
government.
   Reagan ordered that U.S. government payments due to Panama be
held in escrow until constitutional rule is restored in Panama. The
payment due Tuesday relates to operations of the Panama Canal.
   Reagan also ordered that the trade benefits Panama receives
under a special system set up for Third World countries be
withdrawn. Similarly, he suspended Panamanian participation in the
Caribbean Basin Initiaitve, under which some Panamanian products
receive duty-free access to U.S. markets.
   In addition, Reagan said he has ordered that Panama be subject
to intensified scrutiny by U.S. immigration and customs officials.
   The purpose of that move, he said, is to ``apprehend drug
traffickers and money launderers.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said there was no need to
impose an additional sanction relating to the fees Panama receives
from Alaskan oil shipments transferred to U.S. East Coast ports
through a Panamanian pipeline.
   Shultz told a news conference those fees already have been
frozen based on earlier court action.
   Shultz noted that the president's statement referred to the
Panamanian government as ``illegitimate.''
   ``That's a very strong word,'' Shultz said, underscoring the
seriousness with which the United States views the situation there.
   He accused Noriega of trying to impose a military coup in Panama
by deposing President Eric Arturo Delvalle, whom the United States
regards as the legitimate constitutional authority.
   Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, Panama and about 20 other
countries are eligible to sell most products duty-free to U.S.
markets.
   But this measure will have mostly symbolic impact because the
bulk of Panama's exports to the United States are not subject to
duties in the first place. Panama exported between $342 million and
$388 million worth of products to the United States last year,
according to figures provided by U.S. government agencies.
   On Thursday, the House voted 367-2 in support of a non-binding
resolution demanding Noriega's ouster.
   The resolution, which took note of allegations of drug
trafficking, murder, money laundering and racketeering against
Panama's Defense Forces, was approved shortly before the White
House meeting was convened.
   It called on Reagan to ``consider seriously'' additional
economic and political sanctions.
   Members on both sides of the political spectrum lashed out at
Noriega and gave the administration virtually carte blanche to
impose additional sanctions. Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said ``the
government of Panama is in the hands of a thug, a common criminal.''

<HEAD>Retail Sales Rise By 0.6 Percent In February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Friday that retail sales
edged up 0.6 percent in February, bolstered by strong demand for
autos, but economists expressed worries that sales in January were
much weaker than previously believed.
   In good news on the inflation front, wholesale prices fell 0.2
percent in February, pushed down by drops in both food and energy
costs.
   For the first two months of the year, the Labor Department said
prices have been rising at an annual rate of 1.1 percent, half the
modest 2.2 percent increase in 1987. Analysts said inflation should
remain moderate for the rest of the year.
   The Commerce Department report on retail sales said that
consumers purchased $128 billion worth of goods last month, up $714
million from January after adjusting for seasonal variations. While
the February increase was in line with expectations, many
economists focused on a sharp downward revision to the January data.
   Instead of a 0.5 percent rise in sales, the government said
sales actually fell 0.2 percent during January, showing that the
consumer sector is weaker than previously believed.
   Ever since the record collapse of stock prices in October,
analysts have been worried that consumers would become more
cautious and cut back on spending. Since consumer spending accounts
for two-thirds of overall economic activity, any significant
slowdown in this area could topple the country into a recession.
   ``The large downward revision in January shows that the consumer
sector is quite weak,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with
Merrill Lynch. ``Car sales are doing O.K. with the incentives but
other than that, nothing seems to be doing very well.''
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resouces Inc., a private
forecasting firm, said that since October, Americans have been
building up savings, reflecting worries about the future caused by
the stock market decline.
   But he said that strength in other sectors, reflected by the
strong employment gains in February, should provide enough momentum
to keep the country out of a recession. Wyss predicted that overall
economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, would
be an anemic 1.5 percent this year, less than half the 3.9 percent
GNP growth turned in during 1987.
   Auto sales in February increased 1.6 percent following an even
stronger 2 percent advance in January. February sales accounted for
almost one-fourth of total retail spending during the month.
   Without the strength in auto sales, which has been bolstered by
new incentive programs, total retail sales would have risen a
smaller 0.3 percent last month.
   The general merchandise category, which includes department
store sales, suffered a 1.6 percent decline in sales in February
following a 0.1 percent decline in January. January department
store sales had originally been reported as an increase and the
back-to-back declines in this key sector were particularly
disappointing to economists.
   ``Consumer spending is weaker than we had anticipated, but we
weren't looking for much strength in this sector this year
anyway,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group,
a Washington consulting firm.
   Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, were up 1.6 percent in February, boosted by the increase in
car sales, while sales of non-durable goods edged down 0.1 percent.
   Wyss said the car data indicated to him that dealers were having
trouble selling used cars and consumers should be able to find some
good deals in this area in the months ahead.
   Sales at building materials and hardware stores jumped a sharp
2.3 percent in February while sales at furniture and appliance
stores were up a more modest 0.3 percent.
   Sales at specialty clothing stores climbed 0.6 percent in
February, only a partial rebound following a giant 3.3 percent
January decline.
   Sales at gasoline stations fell 1.6 percent in February while
sales at restaurants edged up 0.1 percent and sales at drug stores
posted a 0.6 percent increase.
   Sales at grocery stores enjoyed a 0.7 percent rise in sales in
February, reversing a 0.6 percent January decline.
   The Labor Department report on wholesale prices said that food
prices declined 1.1 percent in February while energy prices dropped
0.8 percent. The cost of lettuce, which had skyrocketed through the
late fall and early winter, fell a dramatic 70 percent.

   Ford Motor Co. is recalling 214,900 cars of
various designs from the 1982 and 1983 model years to fix
pollution-control equipment, the Environmental Protection Agency
said Friday.
   The company has begun notifying owners of 185,000 cars from 1983
equipped with the 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine to bring them in
for adjustment of the exhaust air-injection systems. These cars
were sold as the Ford Escort, Escort EXP and Escort Wagon and the
Mercury Lynx, Lynx LN-7 and Lynx Wagon. About 4,000 cars originally
were sold in California, which has stricter standards than those
applying in other states.
   Cars with this engine equipped with fuel injection, or
designated ``high output,'' are not affected.
   These cars have been exceeding the federal emission standards
for carbon monoxide and unburned fuel, EPA said.
   The agency said Ford also will recall 29,900 cars from the 1982
model year to fix an exhaust gas recirculation system which can
cause excessive emissions of nitrogen oxides.
   The cars affected all have 2.3-liter four-cylinder engines and
automatic transmissions. They were sold as the Ford Mustang,
Granada and Fairmont and the Mercury Capri and Zephyr. Cars
originally sold in California are not affected.
   Dealers will check the carburetor spacer plates, which allows
some exhaust to enter the intake manifold, and clean them of
deposits if necessary.

   Alpine skiers who seek out daring runs
on unmarked trails accounted for half of all Swiss avalanche deaths
last winter and also pose problems for the environment, officials
said Friday.
   Maj. Hugh Lindsay, a close friend of Britain's Prince Charles,
was killed Thursday by a snowslide while skiing outside the normal
slopes above Klosters, Switzerland, the traditional royal winter
resort.
   The heir to the British throne escaped unhurt.
   The Swiss Federal Avalanche Research Institute had warned
Thursday of considerable avalanche danger above 5,250 feet in the
region. The party was skiing at about 5,900 feet.
   ``One obviously doesn't like seeing anyone getting killed. But
when you ski off the path, that is your own responsibility,'' said
David Bramwell, a British skier vacationing in this remote village
90 miles southeast of Zurich.
   In a statement before leaving Switzerland, Charles said everyone
in his group understood the dangers before they embarked into the
avalanche-prone area.
   ``I would like to emphazise that all members of my party,
including myself, were skiing off the piste (trail) at our own risk
and we all accepted ... that the mountains have to be treated with
the greatest respect,'' Charles said.
   But many vacationing skiers and residents in Klosters indicated
they thought Charles should have not been so willing to lead his
companions down the dangerous slope.
   Last winter, eight of the 16 people killed by snowslides in
Switzerland were off-trail skiers, said Claude Francois Jaccard,
director of the avalanche research institute atop Mount
Weissfluhjoch.
   Over the long-term, they make up about 30 percent of all
avalanche deaths. The toll is highest among ski hikers who tour
across mountains on skis often for days, Jaccard said.
   About 1 million skiers, including many foreigners, cut loose on
unmarked runs every year, the Swiss National Association for Sports
says.
   Christian Tischauser, chief ski warden at Corvatsch, about 30
miles south of Klosters, recently called on the Swiss government to
consider legislating curbs on off-trail skiing.
   Neighboring Austria has banned the practice as of this year,
with violators facing fines.
   Switzerland has not followed suit. But one recent outing became
expensive for three Swiss who set off an avalanche as they skied
off marked trails near Zermatt.
   A court last month made them pay the cost of sending out search
teams.
   Swiss authorities, tourism offices and sports associations have
taken the tack of appealing to skiers' responsibility when
venturing off regular runs.
   Some resorts in the Grisons region, where Klosters is located,
already have limited such skiing.
   A nationwide information campaign was launched late last year to
make off-trail skiers aware of safe areas to practice the sport.
   ``The basic capital for tourism is unblemished nature,'' said
Peter Anrig of the Swiss Tourism Association.
   Inexperienced skiers are known to rip through saplings,
ultimately killing off a future tree in a country concerned about
widespread forest damage from pollution, he said. Snow tourists
also tend to litter in the otherwise virgin areas.
   Alpine animals are jolted by off-trailers, experts say, citing
the example of the snow grouse. Skiers often scare the birds out of
snow caves in which they hibernate, leaving them to die of cold and
consumption in glacial temperatures.
   Swiss avalanches have killed an average of 27 people each year
over the past 50 years, according to the federal institute. Six out
of 10 victims are skiers.
   Lindsay's death brought this winter's toll to 12.

<HEAD>70 Israeli Legislators Ask Reagan To Pardon Pollards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy members of the Israeli parliament on
Friday presented a petition calling on President Reagan to pardon
Jonathan J. Pollard, the Navy analyst who was convicted of passing
secrets to Israel.
   The petition, presented to U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering, was
signed by most of the right-wing Likud bloc in the Knesset, or
parliament, and by the left-wing MAPAM faction. It was a rare
display of unity among Israel's divided legislators.
   The Committee for Justice for the Pollards released news of the
petition in the United States.
   It called on Reagan to pardon Pollard, a civilian Navy
intelligence analyst convicted last year of selling secrets to
Israel and sentenced to life in prison. The petitioners also asked
Reagan to pardon Pollard's wife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, who was
sentenced to five years in jail for being an accessory.
   ``It is very rare for an issue to so cut across party lines as
does the plight of the Pollards,'' according to the petitioners.
``All Israel is praying for their release.''
   The Israeli government was severely embarrassed by Pollard's
arrest outside its Washington embassy in 1985, saying it had not
authorized the spying operation. Public pressure, however, forced
the government to foot the bill for some of Pollard's legal fees.
   The Pollard committee noted that the Pollards' punishment was
particularly harsh in view of the fact that he spied for a U.S.
ally.
   In general, ``spies for allies are treated more leniently, if
they are prosecuted at all,'' the committee said.

<HEAD>Workers Across Norway Protest Proposed Wage Limitations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of workers across Norway left
their jobs for several hours Friday to protest a government
proposal to limit wage increases.
   The Labor government introduced the wage limitations in
parliament Friday, and Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland
condemned the protests as illegal.
   The bill would limit the average worker's increase on a weekly
paycheck to 3.5 percent. The government argued the move is needed
to make Norwegian products more competitive and curb last year's
8.7 percent inflation rate, more than twice the European average.
   The bill represents the most severe economic package since a
15-month wage-price freeze was approved 10 years ago. It would
limit pay raises to 15 cents an hour in the next two years.
   Bus drivers, municipal employees, nurses and thousands more
workers in Oslo and 10 other cities left their jobs. Norwegian
radio went off the air for two hours.
   About 1,000 people demonstrated against the bill outside
Parliament in Oslo. ``We do not accept being robbed of our right to
negotiate,'' said Jan Andersen-Gott, spokesman for a white-collar
trade union federation.
   Six trade federations representing about 400,000 workers were
involved in the protests, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported.
   The proposed law followed the lines of an agreement reached two
weeks ago between employers and Norway's largest trade union
federation, which represents about 350,000 members.
   The legislation would take immediate effect upon passage, which
could be within a week.

<TEXT>
   The Archbishop of Canterbury's office on Friday
attacked the ``Jesus is Alive!'' postmark that is being stamped on
millions of letters mailed in Britain, but the Post Office said it
would not withdraw the slogan.
   Bishop Ronald Gordon, Archbishop Robert Runcie's chief of staff,
said the Post Office's decision to frank letters with the Easter
message was inappropriate and an imposition.
   ``The belief that Jesus is alive is at the heart of the
Christian faith and Christians must be expected to wish to affirm
it on appropriate occasions,'' Gordon wrote in reply to a letter of
protest from the British Humanist Association.
   ``But the imposition of a postmark by a public monopoly is
hardly an affirmation of faith since the sender can exercise no
choice in the matter. In this respect the imposition may be
regarded as insensitive,'' he added.
   The Post Office said it was surprised by the criticism and said
many religious groups had used the postal service in the past to
spread religious messages.
   ``There has been a large measure of popular support for this
particular postmark,'' said a Post Office spokesman, speaking on
condition he not be identified.
   The postmark, which also has drawn protestfrom Jews, is being
stamped on nearly all letters mailed in Britain. It says ``Jesus is
Alive!'' next to a cross.
   Paul Slennett, an evangelist bookseller, paid the Post Office
the equivalent of $92,000 to use the postmark for six weeks
starting March 1. He says it is an Easter message and that God told
him to do it.

   Underworld assassins ambushed and shot to

   The town councilmen from Afragola, near Naples, were attacked
Thursday as they drove home from a council meeting, police said. An
undetermined number of assassins riddled their Volvo with gunfire
and fled in their own car.
   The victims were identified as Paolo Sibilio, 39; and Francesco
Salzano, 40. Both were Christian Democrats.
   Investigators said the killings appeared linked to attempts by
organized crime to gain contracts for reconstruction of buildings
damaged in an earthquake in the area in 1980. Sibilio was in charge
of awarding such contracts.

   A local official in southwestern China was
expelled from the Communist Party after his use of influence to buy
up scarce fertilizer led to a protest by 400 farmers, a newspaper
reported Friday.
   The party expelled Liu Xingdong, deputy secretary of Tiefeng
Township in Sichuan province, according to the official China
Daily. It said Liu was under investigation for using the ``back
door'' to buy up chemical fertilizer.
   Such fertilizers are in chronic short supply in China, and there
are reports in the official media of widespread corruption in their
sale and distribution.
   The report said Liu last October asked the local supply
cooperative to sell him 990 pounds of fertilizer for family
members. The report said cooperative workers and truck drivers took
that cue to use their own connections to obtain fertilizer before
it was distributed to local farmers.
   When distribution began in December, farmers reportedly broke
into the cooperative to get fertilizer and remained there for three
days until county officials persuaded them to hand it all back, the
daily said.
   The report said four farmers who led the protest will face trial.

<HEAD>American Senators Suggest Soviets Cut Tanks, Artillery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of U.S. senators told Mikhail S. Gorbachev
on Friday that Soviet superiority in tanks and artillery scared the
West into a nuclear defense, so cutbacks in those arms should
precede strategic missile reductions.
   The senators said they sensed the Soviet leader is less worried
about President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, but they
said they doubted that signaled greater tolerance of it.
   ``I think there has been a lessening of Soviet apprehension
about SDI,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee. ``I think they recognize that it is a long-term
project.''
   The senators met with reporters after a weeklong exchange with
high-level Soviet military and political officials.
   The Kremlin wants to link a superpower agreement on reduction of
strategic weapons to compliance with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty. The treaty outlaws space-based defense systems like
that seen under SDI, popularly known as the ``Star Wars'' program.
   Nunn said the Americans pressed for ``delinkage'' of the two
issues, but they ``did not get any encouragement at all along that
line.''
   The official news agency Tass, in its account of the meeting,
said Gorbachev reiterated the Kremlin's ``allegiance to its
position on a direct linkage'' of missiles cuts with ABM compliance.
   ``Violating it destroys the entire machinery of the agreement,''
Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying. ``We shall never be able to bridle
the rabid charger of the arms race if it is let loose in outer
space.''
   Gorbachev and Reagan signed an agreement eliminating all
medium-range nuclear weapons at their Washington summit in December.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said he assured Gorbachev that the
treaty was likely to be ratified this spring ``with no crippling
amendments'' and that the concern of the Congress and
administration had turned to the issue of how to cut strategic, or
long-range nuclear arms.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators are at work in Geneva on a proposed
treaty to eliminate 50 percent of the superpowers' long-range, or
intercontintal nuclear missiles.
   Both sides have said they would like the treaty ready for
signing in late May or early June when Reagan visits Moscow, but
the senators expressed doubt it would be ready in time.
   Nunn said the Kremlin should first cut its overwhelming
superiority in conventional weaponry such as tanks and artillery.
   ``There is a great correlation between our first-use reliance on
nuclear weapons and their massive conventional forces,'' Nunn said.
   He said he explained to Gorbachev during the group's meeting,
which lasted more than three hours, that a Soviet rollback of tanks
and artillery from Eastern Europe would go far in reducing the
fears of America's European allies about a Soviet military threat.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations, which will lose
their medium-range missiles under the agreement signed in December,
have balked at further nuclear cuts without prior reductions in
Soviet conventional arms.
   ``We would like to see the Soviet Union save some money so it
can devote it to their economic development,'' Nunn said he told
Gorbachev.
   The Senate group, which also included Sens. William Cohen,
R-Maine, Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., also met in
the past week with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
Communist Party foreign affairs secretary Anatoly F. Dobrynin and
Army Chief of Staff Sergei F. Akhromeyev.

<TEXT>
   Zbigniew Nowakowski jumped ship in the dead of
winter with little more than the clothes on his back and hope. Less
than two months later, he and fellow defectors from Polish vessels
are working to build their personal American dream.
   Nowakowski and 16 other Polish seamen walked off four ships
docked in or near Boston in late January, saying they wanted to
flee oppressive political and economic conditions at home.
   Most left wives and children. None spoke English. They have had
their share of struggle. But they say they have no regrets.
   ``I knew it would be difficult at first, and I expected
hardships,'' said Nowakowski, 36. ``I have no intention of ever
leaving.''
   Defector Artur Misiaczuk shook his head vehemently when asked if
he ever considered returning to Poland during the darker moments of
his adventure.
   ``Return? No, this is my home now,'' he said.
   The two men, both of whom say they were members of the outlawed
Solidarity free trade union, spoke Friday through an interpreter.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is processing asylum
requests from the 17. While declining specific comments about the
applications, INS District Director Charles Cob said requests from
Soviet bloc countries ``have a higher percentage of approval than
those from other countries do.''
   Sitting in a booth of the Polish-American Citizens Club in
Dorchester, a tough, working-class section of Boston, Nowakowski
and Misiaczuk chainsmoked American cigarettes, a luxury in their
homeland.
   ``Our initial dream has come true, and that is to have the
freedom of mobility,'' said Misiaczuk, 25, who left his wife and
11-month-old daughter in the seaport of Szeczin.
   ``We want to fullfil our personal American dream, which is the
American dream of all immigrants who come here, to eventually bring
our families here and to continue living and working and geting
acclimated to American society,'' he said.
   Nowakowski, a fellow Szecziner, who left behind his wife, a
2-year-old son and a daughter, 12, looked even further ahead.
   ``I intend to work very hard in the next 20 years,'' he said.
``To me, the most important thing is that I am free now and I will
be free in 20 years.
   ``Our overall goal is to be with our families, and yes, to have
our own homes eventually, a nice place to live and for our families
to live with us.''
   The two now share a two-bedroom apartment in South Boston with
two fellow Polish defectors. Nowakowski works nights in a food
processing plant, while Misiaczuk is a general laborer for a
construction contractor.
   Neither the cramped quarters nor the hard work draw complaints.
Nowakowski, a trained refrigeration technician who attends English
classes by day, spoke with relish about working his way up.
   ``Eventuallly, through school and my own personal ambition, I'd
like to have my own business,'' he said.
   Several of the Poles spent their first night in America in the
office of Mayor Raymond S. Flynn, and Nowakowski and Misiaczuk
spoke enthusiastically of the financial and moral support given
them since, both by the city and Boston's sizeable Polish community.
   But all the help cannot bridge the occasional loneliness.
Misiaczuk's voice trembled when he described his first telephone
call with his wife.
   ``We cried as soon as we heard each others' voice, because we
knew in our hearts that we would not be seeing each other in the
near future, and she told me that they laid her off from work
because of my defection,'' he said. ``I miss them tremendously.
   ``But they are heartened by my stay here and ... about the fact
that things are working out better here than initially expected.''
   He brightened when asked about his favorite things in America.
   ``Pizza,'' he laughed. ``And Madonna.''

<HEAD>Dissident Reports Tanks, Soldiers in City Hit By Ethnic Riots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet dissident said Friday he saw scores of
tanks and soldiers, police and militia keeping order in a
frightened southern city where ethnic rioting killed at least 32
people.
   Andrei Shelkov, who works on the independent political
publication Glasnost, said residents of Sumgait were still
``hysterical'' about the rioting that broke out there two weeks ago.
   Shelkov told a news conference in Moscow that he was in Sumgait,
in the republic of Azerbaijan, for about five hours on Wednesday.
He returned to Moscow the following day.
   Shelkov said that on one street, ``there was a solid line of
light tanks. I counted 47 of them.''Nearby were about 40 civilian
buses full of soldiers, he said.
   Streets were full of soldiers, police and civilian militia. A
curfew was in effect, but businesses and schools were operating,
Shelkov said. He said he talked to Azeris, as the natives of
Azerbaijan are called, and Russians in Sumgait but did not meet any
of the estimated 18,000 Armenians who lived in the industrial city
of 160,000 people.
   Tensions between Armenians and Azeris, whose republics are next
to each other, erupted in violence in Sumgait on Feb. 28. The
rioting was believed sparked by Armenians demands that
Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-dominated region of Azerbaijan, be
annexed to Armenia.
   An hour-long general strike had been proposed in Armenia on
Friday, but a Communist Party official in the Armenian city of
Kafan told The Associated Press it was canceled to avoid stirring
up unrest.
   Gamlet Kocharyan, a member of Armenia's party Central Committee
and of Kafan's governing body, said by telephone that tanks and
troops remained in regions where ethnic tensions had erupted, but
that ``the situation is quieting down a little.''
   ``We are waiting for the 26th,'' when a party and government
meeting on the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh is to be held, he said.
   Kocharyan said Armenians are convinced the Moscow leadership
will make ``the only just decision'' and return Nagorno-Karabakh
region to Armenia.
   Former political prisoner Sergei Grigoryants, the editor of
Glasnost, said he traveled to the Armenian capital, Yerevan, to
witness a march Tuesday by hundreds of thousands of fellow
Armenians in memory of those killed in the Sumgait rioting.
   He showed journalists photographs of streets packed with people
and said they were taken at the march.
   Some Armenians claim the death toll in Sumgait was 350 to 400,
but the government has put the official death toll at 32.
   Shelkov said he could not reach the cemeteries in Sumgait
because they are outside the city, and roads were blocked off.
   Western reporters have not been allowed to travel to the region.
   Shelkov said he was told by a nurse who worked in a maternity
hospital that Azeris broke in during the riots and threw babies out
the window, and that one woman had been disemboweled.
   A man who addressed a gathering of Armenians in Moscow on
Tuesday also said he had seen the body of a slain pregnant woman
and her mutilated unborn baby.
   Neither report was confirmed.
   The army arrived on March 2 to restore order to Sumgait, Shelkov
said.
   ``It was simply a hysterical scene,'' he said of his
conversations with residents of the city.
   The Russians and Azeris claimed that the violence was the work
of Azeris who came to Sumgait from throughout Azerbaijan.
   Grigoryants said Armenians at Tuesday's memorial march did not
blame average Azeris for the killings.
   ``Almost every Armenian family will recall how Azerbaijanis hid
them or tried to hide them,'' he said.
   But he said Armenians were angry with the Moscow media for
portraying as extremists those who demonstrated in favor of
annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Azeris are predominantly Shiite Moslems and most Armenians are
Christians.

   Seven knife-wielding men robbed a watch company
Friday and stole about $2.3 million in spare parts in the biggest
recorded robbery in Hong Kong's history, police said.
   Police said the robbers entered the watch company on the 12th
floor of a factory building and tied up five employees before
escaping with 13 cartons of watch movements.
   No one was injured in the heist which occurred in the Kwai Chung
industrial area in the New Territories. There were no arrests
reported.
   Friday's robbery broke a record set last month when a gang of
masked men snatched $1.65 million in gold and cash from a trading
company's van on its way to the airport.

   A clergyman who is a leading
anti-apartheid activist said Friday he received two death threats
in the past week and that his house and office were stoned.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, said he received a call Friday on his private
telephone line from a man who said: ``We are going to kill you.''
   A similar call was received Monday, Boesak said.
   Boesak said a stone was thrown through a window of his office
near Cape Town while he was at a meeting there Thursday night. His
children called 15 minutes later from the family home nearby to say
a brick had been thrown through a front window, Boesak said.
   Boesak, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other church
leaders have pledged to lead opposition to the white-led
government's recent crackdown on black anti-apartheid organizations
and activists.
   In a series of tough moves starting last month, the government
banned political activity by 18 groups, imposed restrictions on
individual activists and introduced legislation to prohibit foreign
funding of political activity.
   The clergymen plan a series of protest rallies Sunday and have
indicated they may defy any attempt by authorities to stop them.
   Pro-government newspapers have assailed the church leaders'
stance and suggested that authorities should not tolerate civil
disobedience.
   Boesak, 42, is of mixed-race and is one of the co-founders of
the United Democratic Front, the nation's largest anti-apartheid
coalition. The UDF was one of the 18 organizations banned from
political activity.
   The ban was challenged in court papers filed Thursday by three
of the groups _ the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the
Detainees Parents Support Committee and the Release Mandela
Committee.
   Peter Harris, a lawyer involved in the challenge, said the
groups contend that the new restrictions ``comprise so fundamental
an inroad into the ordinary rights of citizens that they could
never have been contemplated by Parliament.''
   A Supreme Court hearing on the challenge is expected in late
April or early May.
   The country's Roman Catholic bishops held a news conference in
Johannesburg to express ``profound dismay'' at the crackdown.

   The drive-in church can move, but
when the spririt moves its members, they'll have to keep their
hands off the horn.
   The city's planning commission on Thursday approved the new
location for the drive-in church on the condition that its mobile
worshipers abandon a tradition of honking their horns when they are
compelled to make a joyful noise.
   For 18 years, Sunday services have been held at the Woodland
Drive-in theater. But the drive-in is being torn down, causing the
Fifth Reformed Church to hunt for a new locale.
   City officials said the threat of increased Sunday traffic and
the possibility of a particularly moving sermon causing a racket at
the new site prompted some opposition to the plan.
   So church officials said they'd tell the faithful to flash their
lights when they felt particularly illuminated during services.
Commissioners thought that idea was OK, but wrote a no-horn-honking
provision into the resolution supporting the proposal.

   The wheels of bureaucracy sometimes
grind slowly, but the passage of a 199-year-old resolution that has
``more mold on it than 6-month-old bread'' may be setting a record.
   The West Virginia Legislature has approved the legislation, 197
years after the mother state endorsed it. The 1789 federal
constitutional amendment allows Congress to approve a pay raise for
itself, but the raise would not be effective until the following
congressional session.
   The amendment was approved by eight states before it dropped by
the wayside in the 1790s, said the sponsor, Del. David McKinley.
Virginia, which divided to form West Virginia in 1863, approved it
197 years ago.
   But Congress neglected to put an expiration date into the
proposal and it has hung around ever since, McKinley said.
   The House of Delegates approved it last month and the Senate
followed suit on Thursday, endorsing it on a 34-0 vote.
   Del. Jim Humphreys balked at the proposal. ``It's got more mold
on it than 6-month-old bread,'' he said. ``I just don't think it's
serious. It's a waste of our time is what it is.''
   But McKinley defended the resolution. ``It's a classy little
piece,'' he said. He added of the nearly 200-year-old proposal,
``It's a sleeper.''

   The news around Newport News isn't good

   Lawmakers in the southeastern Virginia city have rejected a
proposal that would drop the cryptic ``News,'' making the city's
name simply Newport.
   ``Based on historical facts and information, it would serve no
good purpose to change the name of Newport News to Newport,'' the
city's Historical Commission said Thursday.
   The suggestion for the name change came from Councilman Joseph
C. Ritchie, who said he was tired of going on business trips and
saying he was from Newport News, which invariably brought the
response, ``How do you like working for a newspaper?''
   The committee discovered that around the turn of the century,
the city tried to persuade officials of Newport, Va., near
Blacksburg, to change their hamlet's name. Then Newport News could
become the Newport.
   But the original Newportians resisted, taking their case to
court, where, as the current names suggest, they won.
   In its research, the commission also established that the
``Newport'' in the city's name came from explorer Capt. Christopher
Newport, but where the ``News'' came from is anybody's guess.

<HEAD>Premier Goria Resigns; Third Time In Seven Months</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Cossiga asking Goria to remain as caretaker
premier and ADDS details. ADDS byline. No pickup.</NOTE>

   Premier Giovanni Goria resigned Friday as the leader
of Italy's 47th postwar government, saying there was no reason to
delay the fall of the shaky coalition for talks to smooth the
transition of power.
   It was the third time the Christian Democrat quit since taking
office in August, but President Francesco Cossiga rejected his
earlier resignations and persuaded him to stay on.
   Goria handed in his latest resignation to Cossiga on Friday
night. Cossiga asked him to stay on as a caretaker premier until a
new government can be formed.
   Goria, who at 44 was Italy's youngest premier, resigned for the
first time in November in a dispute with the tiny Liberal Party.
   He quit again Feb. 10 after defectors in his own party caused
him to lose a series of secret votes on the budget. However,
Cossiga talked him into returning to office to help pass the
national budget before the April 30 deadline.
   The lower house of Parliament gave final approval Thursday night
to a budget that includes a deficit of 122 trillion lire, or $98.8
billion. The spending plan was very different from the original
proposed by the coalition, which forecast a deficit of $83.3
billion.
   With the budget passed, Goria's days were numbered as the head
of the coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Republicans,
Social Democrats and Liberals.
   Throughout Goria's seven months in office, political infighting
and defections in secret votes made it difficult for him to govern.
   Goria was expected to resign next week with the start of
consultations among leaders of the various political parties about
his successor.
   But Goria said he decided to step down immediately because it
was clear that the ``intentions of some parties was not to reach an
understanding that had the interest of the country'' at heart.
   He did not specify any political party, but Cabinet ministers
from various parties said Goria quit because of Socialist Party
opposition to the government's plan to resume construction at a
nuclear power plant.
   The government announced a moratorium on the construction of the
plant after voters in a referendum expressed their opposition to
nuclear power.
   The government's decision Wednesday to go ahead with the project
angered the Socialist Party leaders.
   At the time of his resignation in February, analysts suggested
some Christian Democrats wanted to undermine Goria and make party
secretary Ciriaco De Mita the premier.

   Why do Americans have different beers for
different times of the day, asked a visiting Soviet public
relations executive who was confused by some U.S. advertizing
techniques and wound up confusing his hosts.
   Valentin V. Kozitsyn, who is traveling with a Soviet cultural
exhibit now at Cincinnati's Union Terminal center, had some
questions for members of the Cincinnati public relations company he
visited Thursday.
   Employees at Smith Kaufman Public Relations were confused by his
beer question.
   They understood when Kozitsyn explained that he had seen a
television commercial saying ``the night belongs to Michelob.''
   And another thing: ``Why is K mart America's favorite store?''
he asked.
   Any advertising or public relations effort in the Soviet Union
is ``done very slowly, with much care and deliberation,'' Kozitsyn
said. He described the American media as fast, colorful and timely.
   ``There is much to learn about the methods here,'' he said.
   Much of Thursday's informal discussion was spent explaining to
Kozitsyn the distinctions between U.S. advertising, public
relations and journalism.
   ``In our country, it isn't so important to explain everything,''
he said.
   Kozitsyn said interest in public relations methodology is
increasing in the Soviet Union because the country, under Communist
Party leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is taking a hard look at its
traditions.
   ``We have not only successes _ we have mistakes,'' Kozitsyn
said. ``There is a need for us to explain our mistakes in history
and modern life. ... There is the need to understand truths.''
   ``There is much we need to teach our own people, and much to
learn about accomplishing that,'' Kozitsyn said.
   Lora L. Doerr, an account supervisor with Smith Kaufman, said
the Cincinnati firm first came in contact with Kozitsyn while
arranging publicity for the exhibit.

   Former national security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane pleaded guilty today to four misdemeanor charges of
withholding information from Congress about Reagan administration
efforts to help Nicaraguan Contra rebels during a statutory ban on
military aid.
   McFarlane, standing before U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.
Robinson Jr., admitted that he withheld information about the
activities of Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and other members of the
National Security Council staff in three 1985 letters to House
committees.
   He also admitted withholding information from the House Foreign
Affairs Committee when he told the panel on Dec. 8, 1986, that he
was unaware of any efforts to solicit donations for the Contras
from a third country.
   Each of the four charges carries a maximum penalty of one year
in prison and a $1,000 fine.
   After entering his plea, McFarlane told reporters that he did
withhold information from Congress on the occasions cited in the
charges, but added:
   ``My actions were motivated by what I believed to be in the
foreign policy interest of the United States.''
   McFarlane said that since the Iran-Contra affair became public
in late 1986, he had spent more than 200 hours testifying privately
and publicly without immunity from prosecution. He promised to
continue cooperating ``until this matter is finally resolved.''
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said he could have sought
more serious perjury charges against McFarlane, but settled for the
misdemeanor charges because the former White House aide had shown
remorse and had tried to correct his original testimony.
   President Reagan, boarding a helicopter for a weekend at Camp
David, Md., refused to comment when asked about McFarlane. ``It's
in the court,'' Reagan shouted to reporters.
   Each charge carries a minimum sentence of one month in prison,
but Robinson reminded McFarlane he could receive a maximum
four-year sentence.
   ``You understand that imprisonment could be consecutive?'' the
judge asked.
   ``I understand that,'' said McFarlane, who spoke in a very soft,
subdued voice.
   Q. ``This is the action you knowingly took with respect to
writing the letters?''
   A. ``It is, your honor.''
   Referring to testimony McFarlane gave the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, the judge asked, ``That was a knowing response?''
   ``It was, your honor,'' McFarlane replied.
   Robinson filed under seal a letter of cooperation that McFarlane
and his attorney, Leonard Garment, had signed as part of plea
bargain struck with Walsh, who is investigating the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Robinson did not set a date for sentencing, indicating that he
will assess McFarlane's degree of cooperation with the prosecutor
before making a decision.
   McFarlane was released on his personal recognizance.
   The charges of withholding information from Congress were
detailed in a criminal information, which is filed when a defendant
hs agreed to enter a guilty plea to charges.
   Secretary of State George Shultz, asked at the White House about
McFarlane's guilty plea, told reporters that ``if he has made some
mistakes, I don't know about that. ... Bud McFarlane continues to
have my strong friendship.''
   The document filed today alleges that McFarlane made false
statements in letters sent in 1985 to the House Intelligence and
Foreign Affairs committees and a Foreign Affairs subcommittee.
   The charges involve assurances to Congress that members of
McFarlane's National Security Council staff, specifically Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North, were not involved in private efforts to help the
Contras.
   In an Oct. 7, 1985, letter to the House Intelligence Committee,
McFarlane wrote that ``Lieutenant Colonel North did not use his
influence to facilitate the movement of supplies to the
resistance,'' the information said.
   In addition, it said, McFarlane assured the committee there was
``no official or unofficial relationship with any member of the NSC
staff regarding fund raising for the Nicaraguan democratic
opposition.''
   Another charge states that on Sept. 5, 1985, McFarlane withheld
information from the House Intelligence Committee when he wrote:
``I can state with deep personal conviction that at no time did I
or any member of the National Security Council violate the letter
of spirit'' of the Boland Amendment, which banned U.S. military aid
to the Contras.
   The Sept. 5 letter also stated that ``we did not solicit funds
or other support for military or paramilitary activities either
from Americans or third parties.''
   The charge notes that the letter ``unlawfully withheld material
information'' from the panel because McFarlane ``then and there
knew and believed that a member of the NSC staff had violated the
letter or spirit of the Boland Amendment by, among other things,
soliciting support for military and paramilitary activities of the
Contras and offering certain advice for the conduct of the Contra's
military activities and organization.''
   The letter was written in response to an Aug. 20, 1985, letter
from the panel's chairman, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., requesting
information about news reports that the NSC staff was helping the
Contras.
   Another charge relates to Dec. 8, 1986, testimony in which
McFarlane told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that he was not
aware of any third country or citizens of a foreign nation helping
the Contras.
   ``The concrete character of that is beyond my ken,'' McFarlane
told the committee.
   The court documents said McFarlane was withholding his knowledge
that ``since 1984 the nationals of the third country referred to
had expressed willingness to contribute millions of dollars to the
Contras,'' and that McFarlane gave a ``representative of that third
country with the number of a Contra-controlled bank account into
which the funds could be deposited.''
   The plea bargain was negotiated by McFarlane's attorney, Leonard
Garment, and Walsh, who is expected to seek a round of indictments
in coming weeks from a federal grand jury that has been
investigating the arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to
the Contras.
   McFarlane has testified extensively before the grand jury
impaneled by Walsh. Last year, McFarlane tried to kill himself with
an overdose of the tranquilizer Valium the day before his scheduled
testimony before a presidential commission that investigated the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Two other Iran-Contra figures have entered guilty pleas in
Walsh's investigation and are cooperating with the independent
counsel.
   Two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz'' Channell and
Richard Miller admitted last year that they participated with North
in an illegal scheme to use a tax-exempt foundation to raise money
for the Contras.
   McFarlane, who resigned as White House national security adviser
on Dec. 4, 1985, traveled with North to Tehran in May 1986 aboard a
plane that delivered spare parts for Hawk missiles that had
previously been shipped to Iran by the Israelis.
   McFarlane carried a cake and a Bible to give to the Iranians
during negotiations over the release of American hostages being
held in Lebanon.
   During testimony before congressional investigators last summer,
McFarlane said he ordered his NSC staff not to solicit private
funds for the Contras.
   North, however, testified that ``I never heard those
instructions.'' He said McFarlane had asked him to help keep Contra
forces operating after Congress imposed a ban on direct U.S.
military aid.
   McFarlane said he was not aware that arms sale proceeds were
being diverted to the Contras until North told him about it during
their return trip from Iran.
   North testified that McFarlane told him to include false
information in a chronology of the arms deal which was prepared in
the fall of 1986, while the Iran-Contra affair was uraveling.
   McFarlane denied he knowingly falsified the chronology, and said
incorrect information was given to him during a meeting led by
North.

   The state Board of Regents began an
investigation Friday of a board member and a state Education
Department employee who wrote a guidebook designed to help students
pass a new Regents-required examination.
   A statement issued by board Vice Chancellor R. Carlos Carballada
said a four-member Regents committee would investigate
circumstances surrounding publication of the book and any
possibility of a conflict of interest.
   The guidebook, designed to improve student performance on the
new social studies evaluation test required of all sixth-graders,
was written by Regent Louise Matteoni and Renee Levitt, an
Education Department employee.
   State Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol said he was
investigating Levitt's role in the development of the book, which
is published by Scribner Laidlaw.
   A brochure from the publisher promoting the book says it
``offers test-taking practice in multiple-choice formats, identical
to those on the New York State Program Evaluation Test.'' The test
was first given last May.
   The promotional literature does not identify Matteoni as a
member of the Board of Regents.
   The 16-member Board of Regents sets education policy for the
state. The board members, elected by the state Legislature, serve
without salary.
   In an interview with the Albany Times-Union, Matteoni said she
didn't perceive any conflict of interest in what she had done.
   ``I thought I was doing something for the children of the state
and teachers of the state,'' said Matteoni, a Brooklyn College
education professor.
   Levitt, reached at her New York City office, refused to talk
about the book, which is sold to schools in packages of 30 for $140.
   Levitt is a $49,094-a-year associate in reading education and
has worked for the Education Department for almost 15 years, said
department spokesman Chris Carpenter.
   Carballada's appointment of the panel to investigate production
of the book came after complaints by the chairmen of the
Legislature's education committees.

   Panicked soccer fans fled knife-wielding
ruffians and triggered the collapse of a sports stadium in Libya,
killing at least 20 people, according to news reports Friday.
   Malta's state radio said two Libyans were arrested in Tripoli
after the collapse.
   Newspapers in Belgrade, quoting a report from the Yugoslav state
news agency Tanjug from Tripoli, said at least 20 people were
killed and hundreds injured when a stadium dividing wall fell
Thursday during a match between Malta and Libya.
   Joe Sacco, the general secretary of the Maltese Football
Association who was in Tripoli with the Maltese team, said Friday
there was speculation in the Libyan capital that the death toll
could be higher.
   The Libyan news agency JANA said a row of seats collapsed at the
June 11 Stadium and that a ``number of spectators were injured.''
The stadium reportedly has a capacity of 70,000, it was not
immediately known how many people were at the game.
   The Times of Malta said panic occurred when someone in the
stands brandished a weapon and the spectators rushed to get out.
   Politika Ekspres, a Belgrade daily, said the incident began when
several fans pulled out knives during a quarrel.
   Some spectators returning to Malta told reporters at the airport
the same story while others quoted people in the stadium as saying
a man was terrorizing the crowd with a snake.
   Politika Ekspres said spectators seeking safety toppled an iron
fence. At the same time, a six-foot thick, 15-foot long wall
dividing the second from the third level of the stadium also
crashed down.
   ``It is hard to believe that anyone under it could have remained
alive,'' Politika Ekspres said, quoting eyewitnesses.
   Several hundred people reportedly were injured when the crowd
from the third level surged down, creating panic that soon spread
to other parts of the stadium.
   People rushed to all exits, and that caused more injuries, the
paper said.
   Finally, about 5,000 fans in the field started chasing the
culprits. One of them was captured but police managed to drag him
free from the hands of the crowd, Politika Ekspres said.
   Malta's Department of Information said the Foreign Ministry was
informed that no Maltese nationals were involved in the accident.
   The Libyans were leading 1-0 in the exhibition game between the
two national teams. The game was stopped and did not resume.
   Maltese Prime Minister Edward Fench Adami sent a message Friday
to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi extending ``our condolences
and deepest sympathies to the familes of the bereaved and to all
those hit by this tragedy.''
   ``The people of Malta join me in sharing your profound grief at
this unhappy moment during the sports festival,'' Fenech Adami said
in the message.

   Arnold F. Willat, who developed the
first cold permanent wave for women, has died. He was 102.
   The Detroit-born electrical engineer, who died Monday, boasted
in 1952 that he would pay $1,000 to the first woman whose hair he
couldn't curl. A newspaper story at the time said no one collected.
   At age 95 he was named to the Cosmetology Hall of Fame.
   Willat manufactured and sold his own solutions and equipment for
permanent waves for 50 years, and only last year his Willat Co. of
San Francisco discontinued manufacturing cold wave solutions.
Willat curl papers and dispensers are still found in beauty shops.
   One of the nation's early electrical engineers, with a degree
from Georgia Tech in 1907, Willat traveled the East Coast after
graduation, and came to San Francisco with his wife in 1913.
   At a manufacturer's request, Willat developed an
electricity-and-heat permanent wave machine for beauty shops but
eventually found a better way to curl hair.
   Willat's son, Forest of Greenbrae, Calif., said his father gave
up rights to several patents in the 1960s after winning large
settlements from major manufacturers. The younger Willat said
scores of companies soon were making and selling cold wave kits.
   Willat is survived by two other sons, Thoreau of New Mexico and
Leon of Mill Valley, Calif.; 11 grandchildren and six
great-grandchildren.
   Services will be private.

   Iran and Iraq stopped nearly two weeks of
attacks on each other's cities Friday, but the Iraqis said they got
in the last volley with 11 missiles fired before their afternoon
truce deadline.
   Hundreds of civilians have been killed or wounded since the
exchange began Feb. 29.
   Eight rockets were aimed at Tehran on Friday and three at the
Iranian holy city of Qom, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
It said the last missile left its launcher at 3:44 p.m., just 16
minutes before time Iraq said it would stop shooting.
   An Iraqi military communique said Iranian leaders would ``be
sparing the blood of their people'' if they also observed a
cease-fire, but if they did not, ``By God, we will make them taste
bitter defeat, and we will deal them unprecedented, violent blows.''
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said eight
civilians were killed and 20 wounded Friday, bringing the toll
since the missile exchange began Feb. 29 to 165 killed and 440
wounded. Iraq has reported many deaths and injuries, but has not
given figures.
   Thousands of people have been killed in periodic rounds of the
``war of the cities'' since the Persian Gulf neighbors went to war
in September 1980.
   Iraq said its jets raided an Iranian tanker in the gulf and
seven cities in Iran, but maritime officials said they could not
confirm the ship attack. Iran said civilians were killed in the air
raids.
   In Washington, U.S. military sources said Iran had begun
building launch pads for Silkworm anti-ship missiles on Abu Musa,
one of its gulf islands, potentially increasing its ability to
menace shipping.
   There were no reports of Iranian missile attacks after two were
fired Thursday night, but Iran said its artillery pounded Basra and
other southern Iraqi cities and its warplanes bombed Iraqi troop
concentrations. Iraq said women and children were killed in the
shelling.
   A military spokesman said on Tehran radio later Friday that Iran
had stopped its ``deterrent attacks'' on Iraqi cities, but would
respond if Iraq attacked Iranian residential areas.
   Turkey was instrumental in arranging the truce, which it had
intended to begin Thursday. The Turks have good relations with both
sides and represent the interests of each on the other's territory.
   Iran had said it would start its cease-fire Thursday afternoon,
but presumably continued its attacks when Iraq did the same.
   Manuser Mottaki, Iran's ambassador to Turkey, said Friday in
Ankara that the Iranians would honor the truce if Iraq did. Both
combatants had made similar statements while Turkey was arranging
the cease-fire.
   Iraq reported firing 71 missiles in the 12 days, 59 of them into
Tehran, and Iran said it launched 29, all but two at Baghdad.
   Tehran was safe from attack by surface-to-surface missiles until
now because it is 290 miles from the border and Iraq did not have
rockets capable of reaching it. Iran periodically fired missiles
into Baghdad, which is only 80 miles from the frontier.
   Iraq said it developed its own long-range missile, but military
analysts say it is using Soviet-made Scud-Bs with strap-on boosters
for added range. They say Iran also uses Scud-Bs, which can fly 190
miles without boosters.
   The defense officials in Washington, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said U.S. intelligence had not yet detected efforts by
Iran to move any of its Chinese-built Silkworms to Abu Musa.
   Iran has batteries of Silkworms, which have a range of about 50
miles, on its shore of the narrow Strait of Hormuz, southern
gateway to the Persian Gulf.
   It also has fired missiles believed to be Silkworms into
Kuwait's main anchorage from the Faw Peninsula, which it captured
from Iraq early in the war.
   In Washington, the Pentagon announced that the 16th convoy
operation of 1988 had ended quietly Friday with two reflagged
Kuwaiti tankers steaming out of the Persian Gulf into the Gulf of
Oman.
   ``The Sea Isle City and Chesapeake City, which began the
southbound transit (from Kuwait) through the Persian Gulf on
Tuesday, were escorted by the guided-missile frigate USS Simpson,''
the Pentagon said.

   A man convicted in the slaying of a drug
dealer later fell in love with a police officer's daughter and
lived with her family for several months before his secret was
revealed.
   Ross Basurto, 24, was sentenced Thursday to 10 years to life in
prison for his role in the November 1985 killing of Mark B.
Borgerson, 25. Basurto admitted in January that he was present when
Borgerson was killed.
   Officer Jose R. Lopez and his daughter, Rachel, testified for
leniency on behalf of Basurto at sentencing, before Multnomah
County Circuit Judge Richard L. Unis.
   Lopez, a 20-year police veteran, told the judge Basurto, using
the name Jay Adams, came to live with his family in July 1986.
Basurto, who met Rachel after the killing, was her boyfriend before
he moved in with the family.
   ``He told me that he had just moved up from California,'' Lopez
said. ``He lived with us four or five months.''
   As a police technician, Lopez had collected evidence at the
scene of the Borgerson killing. But Lopez said he never suspected
Basurto of wrongdoing.
   Basurto, he said, had a good record as an employee of a gas
station and later a towing company.
   Testimony indicated that Rachel Lopez, who is nine months
pregnant with Basurto's child, learned her boyfriend's real name
and read police reports on the killing while working that summer at
the Police Bureau's records department. She said she hopes to marry
Basurto.
   She never revealed what she had discovered to her father, who
learned Basurto's real identity only after his arrest last October.
Basurto was recognized by an individual who had read an item about
the crime in a newspaper.
   Between the time he moved in with the Lopez family and his
arrest, Basurto also lived in Yuma, Ariz., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Basurto is the third and last defendant convicted in the killing.
   Basurto admitted carrying a gun and being present when a
co-defendant shot Borgerson after the two had gone to the victim's
apartment to steal drugs.
   Defense lawyer Gary Carlson said Basurto was a peaceful,
industrious person ``who got swept away'' by an unfortunate
friendship.
   But prosecutor John Foote characterized Basurto as a man of many
sides who had shown his best side to his family and friends.

   Two former bank executives were portrayed Friday
as greedy men hungry for wealth as prosecutors began presenting
their case in a fraud trial linked to the near-demise of
Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Co.
   U.S. District Court jurors, who may sit through six weeks of
testimony, listened to detailed descriptions of alleged fraud that
involved millions of dollars and stretched from the oil fields of
Oklahoma to Continental's offices in Chicago.
   The government has accused former Continental Vice President
John Lytle of buying high-risk loans from now-defunct Penn Square
Bank in Oklahoma City in exchange for nearly $600,000 in kickbacks
between 1980 and 1982.
   Defendant William Patterson, former head of energy lending at
Penn Square, gave the kickbacks to Lytle in the form of unsecured
loans, the government contends.
   A third defendant, Tulsa oil driller Jere Sturgis, is accused of
making payments to Lytle in hopes of getting future loans from
Continental.
   The three men have pleaded innocent.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, you're going to hear evidence that will
prove that John Lytle was not serving the interests of his
employer,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark L. Rotert said.
   He contended Lytle ``was completely financially dependent on
Bill Patterson.''
   Lytle's lifestyle, Rotert said, involved the kind of
``consumption of goods that is associated in this country with the
wealthy, the well-off.''
   ``He was adding rooms to his home in Northbrook. He took
vacations _ not one-week vacations, not two-week vacations, but
month-long vacations,'' Rotert said.
   Lytle, who worked at Continental from 1959 until his dismissal
in 1982, bought furs and rare automobiles, took trips to the French
West Indies and stayed in a luxurious condominium in Vail, Colo.,
where he liked to ski, the prosecutor said.
   ``He had a hot tub there with a retractable roof. He could sit
back and see the craggy peaks of the Rocky Mountains,'' Rotert said.
   Patterson, meanwhile, was the third-largest shareholder in the
First Penn Corp., parent company of Penn Square Bank, the
prosecutor said.
   ``The success of Penn Square Bank was his future, his career,
his livelihood,'' Rotert said.
   Patterson is accused of paying Lytle to ensure Continental's
involvement in loans with Penn Square.
   Continental would be the principle lender in most cases, but
Penn Square benefited from finder's fees worth thousands of
dollars, Rotert said.
   Continental and Penn Square became lending partners on millions
of dollars in loans, largely because of the relationship between
Lytle and Patterson, the prosecutor said.
   Lytle's job as the head of Continental's gas and oil lending
operation in Oklahoma did not involve routine loan approvals, but
he constantly overruled loan officers who opposed risky deals with
Penn Square.
   ``Mr. Lytle did what Mr. Patterson wanted him to do,'' Rotert
said.
   Lytle, 52, and Patterson, 37, are charged with misapplication of
bank funds and wire fraud.
   Sturgis, 40, charged with wire fraud, is acccused of joining the
alleged scheme by helping Lytle cover the unsecured loans from
Patterson after Continental discovered Lytle's personal dealings.
   Penn Square collapsed in July 1982 under the weight of energy
loans it could not collect. In 1984, Continental survived the
largest run on deposits in banking history, with the help of a $4.5
billion government bailout.

<HEAD>Kennedy Supports Increasing Minimum Wage To $5.05 Per Hour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of
the Senate Labor and Resources Committee, expressed his support
Friday for increasing the minimum wage to $5.05 per hour over four
years but said he still remains committed to raises tied to
inflation.
   ``I continue to support indexing,'' said Kennedy, in a statement
released by his Washington office. ``It's the best way to make the
minimum wage a living wage.''
   Kennedy said his committee has scheduled action on the minimum
wage bill during the week of April 11.
   The House Education and Labor Committee voted Thursday to raise
the federal minimum wage to $5.05 an hour in several steps over the
next four years.
   The vote to increase the minimum wage to $5.05, instead of the
$4.65 voted last week by the House labor standards subcommittee,
was seen as an attempt by supporters of an increase to gain a
bargaining chip that will assure the minimum wage will be at least
$4.65 when the measure leaves the House.
   Last week, the subcommittee approved a bill to raise the
$3.35-an-hour minimum wage to $3.85 in 1989, $4.25 in 1990 and
$4.65 in 1991. At the same time, the subcommittee voted to strip
the bill of a controversial proposal that would have indexed or
tied future increases to the rate of inflation.
   ``A fourth year increase is less satisfactory, but it could make
a stronger package, given the president's veto threats,'' said
Kennedy. ``The last time Congress raised the minimum wage in 1977,
we enacted a four-step increase, too.''

   A 25-year-old Albanian oil company
employee seeking political asylum in Greece crawled under an
electric wire fence and gave himself up to authorities, police in
this northern town said Friday.
   The man, identified as Spetim Kenai, from the southern Albanian
town of Fier, crossed the border in daylight Wednesday before
presenting himself at the local police station in the border
village of Pogoniani, a police spokesman said.
   ``He has now been moved to the United Nations refugee center
outside Athens and plans to ask for political asylum,'' said the
spokesman, who requested anonymity in accordance with Greek
practice.
   According to a report in the conservative Athens daily, Free
Press, the man said 17 soldiers and an army officer also recently
fled the self-isolated Balkan state by crossing the border into
Yugoslavia.

   A man who apparently was living in the
attic of a Marshall University dormitory and told students he was
the football team's new quarterback was arrested as a fugitive,
police said Friday.
   Perzell Dinkins, 22, was taken into custody Thursday on a
fugitive from justice charge, said campus Security Capt. Gene
Crawford. Dinkins was being held Friday pending $500 bond,
officials said.
   Dinkins faces felony charges in Lawrence County, Ohio, for
allegedly receiving stolen property, Crawford said. He also has
outstanding arrest warrants in Ashland, Ky., and Jackson, Miss.,
but the charges in those cities were not immediately known, he
added.
   Campus security searched the attic of Hodges Hall after
residents reported a man living there, Marshall's student
newspaper, The Parthenon, reported Friday.
   ``He had some clothing there _ he left it there and would come
in frequently to take a shower and change clothes,'' Crawford said.
   The Parthenon reported that Dinkins told residents of Hodges
Hall he was the new quarterback for the football team. The mens'
dormitory houses most of the school's male athletes and residents
had seen Dinkins there for several days, the paper said.
   Crawford said Dinkins didn't tell police he was on the football
team, ``but he did say he was trying to get a football
scholarship.''
   Dinkins said he had been living in the Huntington area since
January but denied living in the dormitory, police said.

   A Baptist minister and a secretary
insisted Friday that a convicted killer who has escaped Florida's
electric chair six times is innocent and should not be executed
next week.
   The Rev. Sam Sparks and Christine Bass also said they were
disappointed that Gov. Bob Martinez refused to meet with them
Friday to hear evidence they hoped would clear Willie Jasper Darden.
   ``I think a lot of people in Florida are wondering why he won't
sit down for even 15 minutes with Ms. Bass and me. That seems
reasonable,'' said Sparks.
   Meanwhile, Darden's attorneys filed a last-ditch appeal on his
behalf Friday in the Florida Supreme Court. No immediate ruling was
issued.
   The governor said he was satisfied the courts had reviewed
Darden's case thoroughly.
   ``There is nothing that would change my mind. ... The evidence
was clear, the rulings were proper by the courts,'' Martinez said.
   Sparks and Ms. Bass appeared at a news conference called by
Amnesty International, which has tried to focus international
pressure on the governor, who signed a seventh death for Darden
this week, one day after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an
appeal.
   Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, American actress Margot Kidder
and British rock star Peter Gabriel are among those opposing his
electrocution.
   Amnesty International delivered to the governor's office
petitions bearing the signatures of 10,000 people in the
Netherlands who opposed Florida's system of capital punishment. The
group also urged its supporters to call or cable the governor's
office Friday.
   ``It is a violation of human rights,'' said Magdaleno
Rose-Avila, head of the group's campaign to abolish the death
penalty.
   Darden, 54, has survived more death warrants and has been on
Florida's death row longer than any other inmate except one. His
case has become a focal point for capital punishment opponents who
say his trial was tainted by racial prejudice. Darden is black, and
the man he was convicted of killing was white.
   Sparks and Ms. Bass have issued affidavits about the events of
Sept. 8, 1973, that conflict with the versions of the killing
related by the victim's wife and prosecutors.
   Darden was convicted of killing Lakeland furniture store owner
James Turman during a robbery that netted $15. A store employee
also was shot three times and crippled, and Turman's wife had to
fend off a sexual attack.
   Sparks said Turman's wife had told him all blacks looked alike
to her and that her identification of Darden was unimportant
because the lawyers had told her that Darden committed the crime.
   Helen Baum, formerly Helen Turman, recently denied having made
that statement to Sparks and reaffirmed her identification of
Darden as the one who shot her husband. Mrs. Baum said it was her
sister who made the statement Sparks quoted, but Sparks insisted
that it was Mrs. Baum.
   Ms. Bass, a Lakeland secretary, said Darden had an accident near
her house and that he waited for a tow truck until 5:35 p.m. Her
house was eight miles from Turman's store and prosecutor say the
crime occurred at about 6 p.m.
   ``Willie Darden is innocent, and I know it,'' Ms. Bass said.
   Ms. Bass said she tried to meet with Darden's attorney to tell
him what she knew, but was rebuffed.
   Sparks said he did not come forward sooner because he had been
told by Mrs. Baum about a month after her husband's death that
Darden confessed to the crime. Sparks said he didn't know otherwise
until he started talking to Ms. Bass and they compared notes on the
crime.

   A doctor who taped a suicide note to
the wheel of his van at Niagara Falls and disappeared after he was
charged with attempted murder of his estranged wife has telephoned
his father.
   ``He has contacted me and I told the FBI and the court and so
forth,'' Howard Johe, a Charleston architect, said Friday of his
son, Dr. David Johe. ``I don't know what will happen now. I think
the less said, the better.''
   Johe said his son got in touch with him in the past few weeks.
   Until that call, the family had believed that David Johe, 35,
had committed suicide in July.
   In June, authorities arrested Johe and accused him of breaking
into the Bradford, Pa., home of his estranged wife, Blair Plott
Johe, and trying to strangle her.
   Several days after his release on bond, police in Niagara Falls
found Johe's van parked in a motel parking lot. A note taped to the
steering wheel read: ``Goodbye. I hope the water's not too cold. I
guess I'll never know. David.''
   Both the elder Johe and his daughter, Sara Johe, said a note
left in David Johe's home and articles sent to the family convinced
them he had planned to kill himself.
   A body was never recovered.
   Bradford Township, Pa., Police Chief David Doyle has maintained
that he didn't believe the doctor was dead.
   Johe, an orthopedic physician, specialized in reattaching
severed limbs, fingers and toes.

<TEXT>
   About 50 conservationists and residents
of this scenic Philadelphia suburb gathered Friday to protest a
planned power line through a farm made famous by artist Andrew
Wyeth.
   Wyeth, who is from Chadds Ford, used the Kuerner farm for more
than 1,000 studies and at least five paintings over 45 years.
   ``He spent as much time here as I did farming. He painted while
we worked,'' said Karl Kuerner Jr., 61, who raises cattle and grows
hay on the 35-acre farm.
   Philadelphia Electric Co. plans to place wooden utility poles on
a 250-foot stretch of the farm as part of a 11-mile power line
between a Concord substation and Kennett Square, said Bill Jones, a
spokesman for the company.
   Growth in the area southwest of Philadelphia near the Delaware
state line makes the new line necessary before peak demand in the
summer, he said.
   ``The existing lines in the area were overloaded almost daily
when the temperature got over 90 last summer,'' Jones said, adding
that there were several brief blackouts because of the demand.
   Philadelphia Electric serves 1.4 electric customers in
southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Maryland.
   A power line already traverses the Kuerner farm, with three
100-foot metal towers standing on a meadow near a shingled barn.
The new line would come within 35 feet of the barn, Kuerner said.
   Demonstrators holding signs outside the entrance to the Kuerner
farm said an alternate route along a nearby highway would have less
of an impact on the environment.
   ``Route 1 has already got poles and everything. It's not going
to affect the aesthetics,'' said Harry G. Haskell Jr., a former
mayor of Wilmington who grew up with Wyeth in Chadds Ford.
   Wyeth was ill with the flu and could not attend the
demonstration, said John Sheppard, a spokesman for the Brandywine
River Museum, where many of Wyeth's paintings are displayed.
   J.L. Peters, a division manager for Philadelphia Electric, said
the route over the Kuerner's farm had the least impact.
   ``We are cognizant of the natural beauty of the Chadds Ford area
and we have spent considerable time and effort looking at all the
possible routes through the area so as to minimize the impact on
the aesthetics,'' Peters said.
   ``We are convinced the route we have selected achieves that,''
he said.
   Wyeth's paintings using Kuerner's farm include ``Snow
Flurries,'' which is on display at the National Gallery in
Washington; ``Evening at Kuerners''; ``Trodden Weed''; ``Pine
Baron''; and ``Young Bull.''
   ``He has a special feeling for the land,'' Haskell said.
   Kuerner said Wyeth still paints at the farm.
   ``He comes quite often, mostly snow scenes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Increased Loans Predicted For Latin America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outgoing President Antonio Ortiz Mena of the
Inter-American Development Bank predicted on Friday that its loans
to Latin America will increase from last year's $2.361 billion to
between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in 1988.
   ``We can continue on this level until the end of the century,''
Ortiz Mena told a news conference.
   The bank, owned by 44 governments, is a major source of loans to
raise the living standards of Latin American countries, most of
which have seen declines in recent years from their already low
levels.
   After 17 years with the bank, Ortiz Mena is returning to his
native Mexico. He will be succeeded by Enrique Iglesias of Uruguay.
   Ortiz Mena blamed the drop in the bank's lending in part on the
drop in the value of the U.S. dollar, which he said cost the bank
$1.2 billion last year and will cost it another $2 billion in 1988.
   The bank is deep in a dispute with the U.S. government, its
biggest shareholder, which is seeking more control over its lending.
   Ortiz Mena denied that he had blocked a U.S. effort to place a
new man as the bank's executive vice president _ James W. Conrow,
deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for developing nations.
He said the report was a ``fabrication.''
   Ortiz Mena will not be going to a meeting of the bank's board of
governors to be held in Caracas, Venezuela, on March 21. He said
there would be discussion there of additional resources for the
bank from Japan. He would not give a figure.
   He added that there would also be discussion of increasing
Japan's voting strength in the fund, now 1.08 percent of the total.
The United States, the largest contributor, controls 34.5 percent
of the votes.
   Ortiz Mena said the major challenge for the inter-American bank
is to help reverse the present situation in which capital is
flowing out of Latin America instead of into it. The outflow, much
of it interest on old debts, is estimated at $15.7 billion for 1987.
   ``Latin American countries can not fulfill theur debt
commitments unless there is economic growth,'' Ortiz Mena said.
``To achieve growth, it needs investment. There can be no
investment if it is exporting capital. It needs to import capital.''

<TEXT>
   Lyndon LaRouche's attorneys demanded access Friday
to information a prosecutor relied on when he said a top FBI
official conferred with a key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal
about an effort to collect information against LaRouche.
   The attorneys said the information might help them prove their
contention that former White House aide Oliver North asked the FBI
and CIA to infiltrate LaRouche groups because they were interfering
with North's private Contra-resupply effort.
   Also Friday, the trial judge again delayed the resumption of
testimony in the fraud and conspiracy case against LaRouche, six
aides and five organizations because of pending searches of
government records, including those of the White House and Vice
President George Bush, for any evidence suggesting infiltration of
LaRouche groups.
   A prosecutor said the records searches ordered by U.S. District
Judge Robert E. Keeton would take up to three weeks.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham urged the judge to allow
testimony to continue in the interim, but defense lawyers said they
would be unable to competently question witnesses without first
having all evidence of possible government infiltration of LaRouche
groups.
   Keeton said the earliest the jury would be called back to court
was Tuesday. He also said he would decide Monday if a longer delay
was necessary.
   Also Friday, the LaRouche attorneys unleashed several new
allegations of prosecutorial and government misconduct. They
charged the government withheld documents favorable to defense
claims that evidence against LaRouche and followers was fabricated
by government agents working undercover in the political
extremist's organizations.
   In a memo sent to North by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord, one of North's principal operatives in the Contra-resupply
network, Secord said that ``our man'' told him retired Army Sgt.
Maj. Fred Lewis had gathered ``info against LaRouche.''
   Lewis is the executive vice president of Rhyolite Management
Systems, a Texas company the LaRouche lawyers contend was one of
several private companies run by former military officers used by
the CIA to carry out covert activities.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham had told LaRouche defense
lawyers that ``our man'' referred to Oliver ``Buck'' Revell, a top
FBI official involved in counterintelligence operations. Markham
since has said he was mistaken and that the reference was to John
Cupp, a Secord associate who worked in the resupply effort.
   Secord and Cupp, in interviews this week, also have said the
reference was to Cupp. Both denied any role in or knowledge of a
government effort to spy on LaRouche.
   ``If `our man here' is in fact Oliver Revell, it would create a
motive for high-level forces in the FBI and National Security
Council to conceal that in order to protect Mr. Revell,'' the
defense motion said.
   Markham did not immediately respond to the request for
information concerning Revell. An FBI spokesman earlier this week
refused to relay questions from The Associated Press to Revell,
saying the agency would not comment on matters that were at issue
in a current trial.
   An FBI document declassified this week quotes Lewis and two
other men as saying top FBI and CIA officials asked them to
infiltrate LaRouche groups. LaRouche lawyers said they had evidence
the three asked LaRouche aides to assist them in illegal activities.
   Markham contended in a document filed Friday that Lewis and the
two other men were lying when they said they had been asked to
infiltrate LaRouche groups.
   LaRouche attorney Odin Anderson also said Friday that he had
evidence showing Revell intervened to block a planned meeting
between LaRouche and William Clark, who at the time of the alleged
incident was President Reagan's national security adviser.

   A woman was being held Friday on charges
she tried to smuggle a gun, hidden in a lemon pie, into the county
jail, authorities said.
   Sherry Spencer, also known as Lea Spencer, 24, of Elkview is
charged with two felony counts of aiding an escape attempt and one
misdemeanor count of carrying a dangerous weapon, Sheriff Robey
Knight said. He would not identify the prisoner to whom Spencer
allegedly was trying to smuggle the weapon.
   Sheriff's Department Sgt. Russell Goodwin said Spencer was
arrested after she showed up at the Roane County Jail on Sunday and
dropped off a lemon pie for a prisoner.
   The pie was in an aluminum dish, and because prisoners are
prohibited from receiving metal objects, a guard transferred the
pie to a paper plate. As he did, Russell said, a .22-caliber pistol
and 13 rounds of ammunition dropped out.
   The gun and ammunition were wrapped in plastic, Russell said.
   Spencer was being held in the Wirt County Jail pending $12,500
bond, Knight said. A preliminary hearing is scheduled Wednesday.

<HEAD>Angry Over Coeducation, Wheaton Alumnae Plan to Fight in Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nine Wheaton College graduates go to court Monday
in an attempt to prevent the school from using funds raised by
alumnae for new coeducational purposes.
   The group claims to represent hundreds of alumnae around the
country upset by the school's plan to admit men this fall for the
first time in its 154-year history.
   At issue is $10.7 million raised by alumnae from 1983 to 1985 in
a telephone fund drive marking Wheaton's 150th anniversary, says
alumna Mary Anne Marsh.
   ``The theme of the drive was preparing women for the 21st
century,'' said Marsh. ``We had been given no idea they planned to
make the school coed.''
   Alumnae first received letters informing them of the plan to go
coeducational in January 1987, Marsh said. But she added, ``It's
very clear that this plan was conceived before the first phone was
picked up.''
   The trustees of this college of 1,200 students 30 miles south of
Boston endorsed the move last May. At that time, President Alice
Emerson said the change was not being made for financial reasons
but because of a nationwide decline in high school graduates and
studies showing a waning interest in single-sex colleges.
   Nancy McCann, another of the nine alumnae, expressed anger about
the plan.
   ``It's important to keep women's colleges alive,'' she said.
``There should be options. Women's colleges afford women the chance
to take a real leadership role while they are trying out their
wings before they go into the real world.''
   Wheaton spokeswoman Lisa Byrnes said the school would ``seek
judicial approval to use these funds for coeducational purposes''
at Monday's hearing in Bristol County Probate Court.

<HEAD>Government Says Biaggi and Co-defendants Plundered Wedtech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi and six co-defendants
were greedy thieves who plundered a now-defunct Bronx defense
contractor for millions of dollars, the government charged Friday
as the Wedtech Corp. racketeering trial unfolded.
   ``This is a case about corruption and greed and the purchase and
sale of public offices. It is a case about public officials who
want to get paid twice, once by the people who elected them to do
their job, again by someone else,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard
Wilson told the jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   ``This case involves the story of the rise of a little company
in the Bronx'' that began in 1965 as a machine shop and grew by
1978 to $1.5 million in sales by taking advantage of laws that
promoted the growth of minority-owned enterprises, Wilson said.
   ``Seven years later, this company had grown like Topsy'' to a
defense contractor with 1,000 employees and $117 million in
revenues, becoming ``the biggest single employer in the Bronx,'' he
said.
   ``The success was achieved through corruption and lies.''
   This case is part of a scandal that also led to the indictment
of former White House aide Lyn Nofziger and two former associates
of Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Nofziger was convicted last month of lobbying former White House
associates within one year after he left the government on matters
including a federal contract for Wedtech.
   Defendants in the Manhattan trial are Biaggi, 70: former Bronx
Borough President Stanley Simon, 57; Bernard G. Ehrlich, 59, of
Bedford, Biaggi's former law partner and a former major general in
the New York National Guard; Biaggi's son Richard, 38, of Fort Lee,
N.J.; Peter Neglia, 39, of Armonk, the former regional
administrator of the Small Business Administration; John Mariotta,
57, Scarsdale, former Wedtech chairman; and Ronald Betso, 39, of
Brooklyn, a former cop and friend of Neglia's.
   ``They all treated this company like a gold mine,'' said Wilson.
``Some took a lot. Some took a little. But they all took.''
   They engaged in the scheme by saying that Mariotta, who is
Hispanic, was the majority owner of Wedtech, and thus the company
was entitled to a federal program that allowed companies to get
government business without bidding, the government says.
   The minority member of the company must own more than 51 percent
of the firm. But in fact, Wilson charged, Mariotta owned less than
half.
   Biaggi at one point demanded 5 percent of Wedtech's revenues,
but that was too much for Wedtech officials, Wilson said, who then
gave him 5 percent of Wedtech stock that was put in his son's name.
   At another point, Biaggi asked for $50,000 for expediting a
lease before the city's Board of Estimate, the prosecutor said, and
the law firm his son worked for received the money the day after
the lease was signed.
   In addition, the law firm earned $1 million in retainers' fees
from Wedtech from 1978 to 1985, Wilson said.
   Simon, who was borough president from 1979 to 1987, demanded and
received over $50,000 that came in cash in envelopes, meals, chips
for gambling in Atlantic City casinos, pink marble in his home, a
trip to Rome and contributions in his name to charities, Wilson
said.
   He also got a job for his brother-in-law at Wedtech and took
half his raises over the years, Wilson said.
   Neglia as regional SBA head and then as acting chief of staff in
Washington was Wedtech's ``paid-for friend,'' Wilson said.
   Among other things, Wilson contended, Neglia warned the company
about a congressional inquiry, provided Navy specifications for
bidding on a pontoon contract Wedtech wanted and helped Wedtech
obtain contracts of increasing value.
   Neglia was paid with stock options, frequent meals,
contributions to the Republican Party in his name and the promise
of a job once he left office, Wilson said. Less than a month after
leaving the government in early 1986, he went to work for the law
firm Biaggi and Ehrlich.
   Mariotta embezzled about $1 million and sold Wedtech stock worth
between $6 million and $8 million, Wilson charges. Ehrlich was
``Mario Biaggi's partner in the plunder of Wedtech. When he got it,
he split it,'' Wilson charged.
   Richard Biaggi became a lawyer in 1982 and ``became the front
man in this case,'' Wilson said, sometimes taking money or stock in
his father's name. Betso was a smaller player who took stock
options in his name for his friend Neglia, Wilson alleged.
   Wilson said he would present testimony from Wedtech accountants,
supervisors, workers, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, and four former
officials who have pleaded guilty to crimes involving Wedtech.
   Defense attorneys begin presenting their arguments Monday.

<TEXT>
   In life, Bill Britt's refusal to budge from
his makeshift hut in the woods earned him the image of cantankerous
eccentric. But friends and family on Friday mourned the 52-year-old
hermit as a free spirit who loved nature.
   ``My father never really was a hermit,'' said his tearful
daughter, Ingrid Boughner, 28. ``He was a naturalist. ... He was
the most colorful and articulate human being. He loved me for being
me and he gave me the courage to be myself.''
   ``Bill Britt was a truly rare human being. There are not enough
accolades to describe him. He had a zest for life, a passion for
freedom, independence and the beauty of the woods,'' said Bill
Baird, the abortion activist who befriended Britt 20 years ago.
   Britt's daughter and son, Britton Steven Boughner, 30, as well
as his mother, Marion, 86, two brothers and many other relatives
gathered with his friends for the memorial service at a funeral
home.
   The oak casket at the front of the room was bedecked with
flowers. Someone had also placed on it a photograph of the hermit
hugging one of his beloved trees. There was also a stuffed toy
raccoon, a memory of the man's love for wild animals, and a
hand-made card written by his son and daughter.
   The family planned to cremate the body. Baird said he would
scatter the ashes Saturday at Britt's favorite tree despite
objections that a license is needed.
   Britt was once a married man with a house, three children and a
job in an office. It all crumbled when he divorced in 1969.
   Britt cast off his three-piece suits and his three-piece name,
Britton William Boughner. He began to spend time in the woods at
the state-owned Chestnut Hill reservoir, near the affluent suburb
of the same name where he was born and raised. They called him the
``Hermit of Chestnut Hill.''
   But he was hardly a recluse.
   Britt was shrewd and stubborn, given to tears when he didn't get
his way. He resembled a tall child as he rode the trolleys and
hunted for pay phones to call reporters, clad in cast-off clothing
and dragging a clattering armful of plastic buckets that served as
his portable office.
   Bear-shaped and nearly toothless, Britt had blind eyes swollen
with infection. He refused welfare and lived on the nickels he got
for empty bottles and cans.
   Two years ago, Britt became the subject of legal efforts to pry
him from the patch of state land.
   Britt fought back by cultivating the image of misunderstood
hermit who wanted only to be left alone among the trees. It landed
him a spot on ``Late Night with David Letterman.'' Actor Mickey
Rooney suggested making a TV movie about Britt's life.
   A sympathetic judge respected Britt's wish for a suburban Eden
and ordered the state to find a suitable alternative site.
   Britt refused them all.
   Last July, he was finally forced from state land and moved to
the adjacent Boston cemetry.
   Officials said Britt froze to death about two weeks before his
body was found Monday at the Chestnut Hill cemetery. His remains
were found by his daughter and son, inside the lean-to where he
lived.

<TEXT>
   An American peace activist held by
Contra rebels for nine days said Friday the experience was ``the
most terrifying'' of his life and his captors threatened to kill
him if he tried to escape.
   Richard Boren, a 30-year-old Witness for Peace volunteer from
Elkin, N.C., said he was forced at gunpoint to go with the Contras
after they captured him during an attack March 1 on a northern farm
cooperative.
   They freed him Wednesday night, suffering from a cold but
unharmed.
   Witness for Peace, based in Durham, N.C., opposes U.S. policy on
Nicaragua and support for the rebels, and seeks to document Contra
human rights abuses.
   ``The explosions sounded like they were all around, literally, I
thought we'd end up getting killed,'' Boren said of the rebel
attack on the cooperative.
   ``I heard a shot right at the door to the house I was staying
in,'' he said. ``I looked up and saw Isabel Ramos, the 13-year-old
girl, was wounded.''
   He said he left the house with his arms raised and was taken,
along with 12 Nicaraguans, by the Contras. ``I asked them if they
were going to kill me and their response was `yes' if I ran'' away,
he added.
   Boren said his release Wednesday night near Quilali, a village
170 miles north of Managua, surprised him. He said he plans to go
back to the United States for a while to see his family and friends.
   ``I have now personally experienced the terror the Nicaraguan
people are subjected to at the hands of the Contras,'' he said.
``It has been the most terrifying experience of my life and I doubt
the emotional scars from the experience will ever completely heal.''
   He was the second American member of Witness For Peace captured
by the Contras. Last October, the rebels held Robert Fisher for two
weeks in central Chontales province.

<TEXT>
   The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee said Friday it has asked Attorney General Edwin Meese III
to place Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on its border
``watch list'' and order that he not be allowed to enter the United
States as a private citizen.
   The committee also filed suit in federal court demanding U.S.
government documents relating to Shamir's activities as a member of
the militant Stern Gang which waged guerrilla warfare in the
struggle for an independent state in what now is Israel.
   ``We believe in the ADC there should be one stand for
terrorists, one for friend and foe alike,'' said Abdeen Jabara,
president of the committee. ``We believe the U.S. government should
have one yardstick.''
   Shamir is to visit the United States next week, meeting with
President Reagan on Wednesday. Even if he were on the watch list,
Shamir would not be turned away since he is coming in an official
capacity.
   The United States last year placed Austrian president Kurt
Waldheim on its watch list because of his suspected participation
in Nazi war crimes during World War II. The watch list is so called
because U.S. consular officials around the world check the list
before issuing visas for visits to the United States.
   ``The basis for this request rests on the long history and
involvement of Mr. Shamir as a leader of the infamous Stern Gang
which was responsible for numerous acts of terrorism,'' said the
ADC's letter to Meese, dated Thursday. The Department of Justice
had no comment on the letter.
   The court petition, also filed Thursday, asked for documents in
the possession of the Departments of Justice, Defense and State,
the CIA and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``Shamir's violent opposition to the British forces in Palestine
led to his imprisonment on at least two occasions,'' the court
complaint said. ``Shamir was in charge of organization and
operations of LEHI (the formal name of the Stern Group) which had
adopted a policy of individual acts of terror.''
   Jabara said his group wants the documents to back its efforts to
have Shamir declared persona non grata.
   ``Shamir has never renoucned his participation with the above
mentioned groups nor has he ever denounced their use of
terrorism,'' the ADC complaint said. ``Shamir is legally excludable
from entering the United States.''

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Friday questioned the
right of the Soviet Union to provide arms to the government in
Afghanistan, denouncing the regime in Kabul as ``a faction in the
Afghan civil strife.''
   In a strong statement, department spokesman Charles E. Redman
said U.S. aid to the Afghan rebels who have waged a civil war for
more than eight years would not be halted until the Soviets stopped
their assistance to the Kabul government.
   ``There will be no cutoff of support for the resistance under
any other circumstances,'' Redman said.
   On Thursday, Nikolai Kozyrev, the Soviet foreign ministry's
adviser on Afghan affairs, declared that Moscow would not stop
arming the Kabul government as part of an agreement for an Afghan
cease-fire.
   The official accused Pakistan and the United States of holding
up a peace agreement that would end the war and allow the Soviets
to withdraw an estimated 120,000 troops from the country.
   It was not immediately clear what impact the U.S. and Soviet
disagreement on aiding the rival groups would have on negotiations
the United Nations is holding in Geneva between Pakistan and
Afghanistan.
   Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev had offered to
begin a troop withdrawal on May 15 if an agreement was concluded by
next Tuesday.
   The Geneva draft agreement calls for ``noninterference'' in
Afghanistan.
   Redman said it was ``only logical'' that the provision apply to
the Soviet Union as well as the United States.
   ``The Soviets cannot claim a right to aid a faction in the
Afghan civil strife just because that particular faction tries to
call itself the government of Afghanistan,'' the spokesman said.
   ``The war in Afghanistan, in fact, is on this central issue,
concerning the very legitimacy of the Kabul regime,'' he said.
   Even with Soviet support, Redman said, ``the present Kabul
regime has been barely able to secure the capital and a few other
cities.''
   The U.S. official did not mention the U.S. weapons, including
Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, that Washington has sent the rebels
through Pakistan.
   The Stingers have downed Soviet and Afghan aircraft and
helicopters and forced pilots to fly higher, reducing the
effectiveness of air power against the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Tass Accuses Washington of Trying to Crush Independent Panama</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tass charged Friday that U.S. economic sanctions
against Panama are an attempt to subjugate that Central American
nation and reclaim the Panama Canal.
   The official Soviet news agency said in its commentary,
``Reports on developments around Panama leave no doubt that the
Washington administration intends to crush the independence of that
country and perpetuate U.S. domination over its territory, first of
all the Panama Canal Zone.''
   It described drug-trafficking accusations against Panama's
military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, as ``a convenient
pretext'' for interfering in internal Panamanian affairs.
   ``It is only a short time ago that Gen. Noriega was regarded in
Washington as `one of ours,''' Tass stated.
   President Reagan stepped up economic pressure on Panama Friday,
ordering that a $6.5 million payment due Panama next week be put
into escrow.
   Trade benefits were suspended earlier and Reagan ordered
intensified scrutiny of Panama by U.S. Immigration and Customs
Service officials.
   On Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a
non-binding resolution demanding Noriega's ouster. Reagan has
refered to the Panamanian government as ``illegitimate.''
   Tass said the United States is trying to pressure Panama into
renegotiating agreements requiring U.S. soldiers to leave by the
year 2000.
   ``What Washington would really like is to do away with Panama's
independence, make it back into the obedient U.S. puppet it used to
be, and seal the U.S. right forever to own part of Panamanian
territory and keep U.S. military bases there,'' Tass said.
   Noriega was indicted by U.S. grand juries in Florida in February
on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. He has denied the
charges.
   The Tass commentary lectured Washington it should ``look first
at what is happening under its very nose,'' and accused Lt. Col.
Oliver North and former National Security advisers Robert McFarlane
and John Poindexter of ``direct involvement in drug-related
crimes'' as part of the Iran-Contra scandal.

   Here, at a glance, are developments in the economic picture
Friday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RETAIL SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales edged up 0.6 percent in February, but sales in
January were much weaker than previously believed.
   Instead of a 0.5 percent rise, sales actually fell 0.2 percent
during January, showing the consumer sector is weaker than
previously believed.
   Auto sales in February increased 1.6 percent following a 2
percent advance in January. February sales accounted for almost
one-fourth of total retail spending during the month.
   Without the strength in auto sales bolstered by new incentive
programs, total retail sales would have risen a smaller 0.3 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHOLESALE PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices fell 0.2 percent in February, pushed down by
drops in both food and energy costs.
   For the first two months of the year, the Labor Department said
prices have been rising at an annual rate of 1.1 percent, half the
2.2 percent increase in 1987. Analysts expect inflation to remain
moderate for the rest of the year.
   Food prices declined 1.1 percent in February while energy prices
dropped 0.8 percent. The cost of lettuce, which had skyrocketed
through the late fall and early winter, fell a dramatic 70 percent.

   The U.S. dollar fell against other major currencies in quiet
European trading. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.80 Japanese

fell to 127.80 yen.
   The British pound continued to climb against the dollar, trading
at $1.8535 up from $1.8435 late Thursday. The pound has leaped by 4
percent in value against the dollar this week.
   Dealers said trading was light and without direction both in
typical pre-weekend fashion and because traders were waiting for
the January U.S. trade report to be issued next Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Federal aviation officials on Friday
unveiled a regional air traffic control center's new computer
system, part of a $197 million nationwide system they say will
improve air safety even though it will be replaced within 12 years.
   Published suggestions that the new computers already are
outdated are ``very, very misleading'' because the agency wanted
computers with proven reliability, not the newest models available,
said Ed Harris, an associate administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   ``We would have been crazy to gamble on a system that was
unproven,'' Harris said before the dedication of the new computers
at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center.
   The center, in Palmdale about 50 miles north of downtown Los
Angeles, controls instrument flight operations in 177,000 square
miles of airspace over Southern and Central California, southern
Nevada, southwestern Utah, northwestern Arizona and the Pacific
Ocean out to 250 miles off California's coast.
   Attention has been focused on the region's heavy mix of
commercial and general aviation aircraft since a small plane flew
into restricted airspace over suburban Cerritos and collided with
an Aeromexico jet on Aug. 31, 1986, killing 82 people. Cerritos is
20 miles southeast of the airport.
   Since the crash, several reviews of FAA records indicated its
radar and tracking network was a jumble of different computers and
outdated electronics, many of which were inoperable or down for
repairs a considerable amount of time.
   The Los Angeles center is the 13th of 20 FAA traffic control
centers nationally to activate the new computer system, made by
International Business Machines Corp.
   But the FAA will start replacing the new computers _ as well as
display screens and other equipment used by controllers _ with a
highly advanced, $2 billion to $4 billion nationwide system by
1995, and intends to complete installation by the end of 1999, said
William Carson Jr. of IBM.
   Thousands of IBM 3083s like the ones unveiled Friday were sold
to banks and businesses until IBM stopped making them last year,
Carson said.
   Computer technology ``is advancing so quickly that if you waited
for state-of-the-art, you'd never buy anything,'' said Nobby Owens,
an FAA deputy associate administrator. ``The old (IBM 9020) system
was at capacity. The reliability of this (IBM 3083) equipment
offers use exactly what we want.''
   FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said IBM 3083 computers already have
been activated at traffic control centers in Oakland, Calif., which
covers the San Francisco Bay area; Seattle; Houston; Denver;
Boston; Washington; Chicago; Albuquerque, N.M.; Memphis, Tenn.;
Cleveland; Atlanta; and Miami.
   Scheduled to get the computers by mid-year are centers in New
York City; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Mo.; Indianapolis;
Jacksonville, Fla.; Fort Worth, Texas, including the Dallas area;
and Salt Lake City, she said.
   ``The new IBM mainframe computers are up to 10 times faster and
have four to five times the storage capacity of the equipment they
will replace,'' FAA Administrator T. Allan McArtor said in a
prepared statement.
   ``This will allow the air traffic control system to keep pace
with projected traffic growth over the next decade and accomodate
the introduction of new automation functions that will both enhance
safety and increase controller productivity,'' he added.
   The Los Angeles center's system was activated March 1, but was
formally dedicated Friday by H.C. ``Mac'' McClure, FAA regional
director.
   The IBM 3083s will be equipped with conflict-alert programs to
give controllers flashing warnings if two planes start to get too
close, even if one of the planes isn't under a controller's
jurisdiction, Owens said, adding other software will help improve
traffic flow.
   The 600-employee center in Palmdale handled about 1.9 million
flights last year and is the fifth busiest in the nation.
   The FAA said the new computers are only one aspect of its $12
billion, 20-year modernization plan, which also will include new
landing systems, better radars and a major upgrading of weather
reports for pilots. Fourteen percent of the modernization project
has been completed nationwide, with 70 percent of the work under
contract.

   Robert C. McFarlane left congressional
Iran-Contra investigators in little doubt last spring that he had
deliberately misled Congress about efforts inside the Reagan
administration to sidestep a ban on aid to Nicaragua's Contra
rebels.
   Some committee members said at the time they felt the former
national security adviser's under-oath testimony must have been
true because it was so self-damaging.
   McFarlane put the seal on that judgment Friday when he pleaded
guilty to four misdemeanor charges accusing him of withholding from
Congress the fact that the administration had helped the Contra
movement stay alive, in part through soliciting secret
multi-million dollar contributions from third countries.
   By pleading guilty, McFarlane in effect admitted he made false
statements in letters sent in 1985 to the House Intelligence and
Foreign Affairs committees and in testimony in December 1986 before
the Foreign Affairs panel.
   In that testimony McFarlane made this statement: ``I did not
solicit any country at any time to make contributions to the
Contras. I have seen reports that various countries have.''
   That was challenged by John Nields, chief counsel of the House
Iran-Contra panel, who referred to the country involved as
``Country 2'' although it had been independently identified as
Saudi Arabia.
   ``Now in fact, you did have a pretty good idea of Country 2's
funding of the Contras, didn't you?'' Nields asked.
   ``Yes,'' McFarlane replied.
   Nields: ``In fact, as you've testified yesterday and today, you
had a hand in obtaining contributions totaling approximately $32
million from country two?''
   McFarlane: ``Yes.''
   Nields: ``But you did not tell that to the Foreign Affairs
Committee at that time?''
   McFarlane: ``No, I was trying to use some tortured language,
inappropriately I think. ... It wasn't a full account. ... This
isn't as full an account as I could have given.''
   Later, he said that testimony and his statements in the 1985
letters were ``clearly too categorical on my part.''
   In other portions of his Iran-Contra testimony, McFarlane said
he had helped alter documents, failed to shut down an
out-of-control covert operation and did nothing when Marine Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North told him he planned to hold a ``shredding
party.''
   McFarlane said repeatedly that if anyone was at fault in all of
this, it was he.
   Summing up, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House
committee, rejected McFarlane's attempt to take all of the blame.
   ``As the national security adviser you are the spokesman for the
president of the United States,'' Hamilton told the witness.
   ``And when we write to you, we do not write to Mr. McFarlane, we
write to you as the representative of the president.
   ``And when you spoke to the Congress and when you wrote to the
Congress, we accepted your words and your assurances as those of
the president.
   ``You spoke for the president,'' Hamilton said. ``And the
responsibility must rest with him, as well as with you. You cannot,
it seems to me, accept responsibility for mistakes, as admirable as
that may be, and thereby absolve the president of any
responsibility.''
   ``There is no rebuttal,'' McFarlane replied.
   McFarlane, who has testified at length before the grand jury
empaneled by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, attempted
suicide last year by swallowing 30 to 40 Valium tablets one day
before his scheduled testimony before a presidential commission
that also investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   Walsh was not permitted to use McFarlane's testimony before the
Iran-Contra panel as evidence in his case, since McFarlane
testified before the congressional committee under a grant of
limited immunity.
   After resigning as national security adviser on Dec. 4, 1985,
McFarlane was asked the following May to lead a secret mission to
Tehran to open contact with so-called moderate Iranians thought to
have influence with Lebanese radicals holding several kidnapped
Americans.
   With North as a member of the party, the group traveled aboard
an aircraft carrying spare parts for Hawk missiles previously
shipped to Iran by Israel.
   The cake and the Bible signed by President Reagan, which
McFarlane also carried as gifts, were to become celebrated symbols
of the affair.

   Koko, the cover girl gorilla who
communicates through sign language, may be bred with Colossus,
reputed to be the largest lowland gorilla in captivity, a zoo
official said Friday.
   Koko, whose ability to use sign language and doting upon a pet
kitten landed her on the cover of National Geographic magazine, has
signed to her keepers that she wants to have a baby, said Penny
Patterson, director of the Gorilla Foundation at Woodside, Calif.,
where the ape lives.
   She may get that chance with the aptly named 600-pound Colossus,
who is moving Sunday from New Hampshire to Florida, said Pat Quinn,
president and director of The Zoo near this Panhandle city.
   An initial attempt at breeding may be through artificial
insemination, but Quinn said he hoped Colossus eventually would be
able to mate naturally with Koko and other females.
   Semen will be obtained from Colossus just before he is flown in
a chartered DC-3 from Benson's Animal Park in Hudson, N.H., to
nearby Pensacola and then trucked to The Zoo, Quinn said.
   ``We are hoping to obtain some of that for use with Koko because
she is very anxious to become a mother,'' said Ms. Patterson.
   Koko's original pet kitten, which she named All Ball because the
Manx cat had no tail, was hit by a truck and killed after the
National Geographic story. But Koko was given a replacement she
named Smokey, now full-grown.
   Koko, 16, and a male gorilla, Michael, communicate with sign
language to express their feelings, ask for food and certain
teachers and inquire about other animals.
   Colossus' sperm may be used because captive gorillas sometimes
develop incest taboos against cage mates so Michael would be
unsuitable, Ms. Patterson said. Also, Colossus was captured in the
wild as an infant 20 years ago and isn't inbred with zoo gorillas.
   ``We hope to socialize him so he will breed naturally with
females,'' Quinn said.
   Colossus has never seen another gorilla outside his original
family. The socialization process would start by letting Colossus
see, smell and touch a male chipanzee, said Quinn. Then he would be
introduced to another bachelor male gorilla or a non-productive
female before trying to mate him.
   Quinn said he is working closely with Lester Fisher, director of
Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo and chairman of the Gorilla Species
Survival Plan for the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
   Fisher, a veterinarian, said nothing definite has been decided
on breeding yet, but that he was happy to see Colossus remain
within the zoological community because he is the first gorilla in
a long time to go on the auction block. He would provide a new gene
pool because he was born in the wild.
   The plan is designed to develop a self-sustaining captive
breeding program in North America because the number of animals in
the wild are dwindling and threatened by encroaching civilization.
   After his arrival Sunday night, Colossus will be kept isolated
for several days, with a coming-out news conference scheduled for
Friday, Quinn said.

<HEAD>Father of Dead Teen Dancer Waives Rights To TV Movie About
Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of a teen-age nude
dancer who killed herself said he signed away his rights to the
story ``to clear my conscience for being a failure,'' a newspaper
reported Friday.
   Robert Mancini said he signed the waiver for South Florida
promoter Ron Sachs, who is negotiating with Warner Brothers on a
made-for-television movie about Tina Mancini. The 17-year-old
killed herself two years ago.
   Last October, Theresa Jackson, Tina's mother, was convicted on
three felony child abuse charges by jurors who agreed she had
coerced her daughter into working in nude-dance bars.
   Mrs. Jackson is free on bail while she appeals the convictions
and one-year jail sentence. She has been prevented from profiting
from her daughter's suicide under the state's so-called ``Son of
Sam'' law, in which a felon can be denied some or all of the money
or ``any other thing of value accruing ... for an accounting of
that convicted felon's crime.''
   Mancini, 47, who said he and Mrs. Jackson divorced while she was
pregnant with Tina, their second child, said he waived his rights
``to clear my conscience for being a failure ... for failing to
reach Tina.''
   He said in an interview from his home near Los Angeles that he
didn't see his daughter until she was 14 when she visited him for a
few months.
   ``I tried to give her a normal life for a while _ Disneyland and
hiking in the mountains,'' Mancini said. ``I always wish I'd have
been smart enough to keep her here. It would be nice if we could
save some other kids.''
   Sachs told the Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel that Warner
Brothers made an offer to make a television movie based on a
proposal he presented and would co-produce. He can now depict
Mancini in the movie about Tina.
   Mancini said he will receive no money for the waiver.
   ``We're pretty much in accord on the story,'' said Sachs, who
owns the story rights of Tina's grandfather, Charles Gouveia. ``I
am almost certainly going to make a deal with Warner Brothers.''

<HEAD>Survey Finds Concern Over Staff Cuts, Poor Morale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty-three percent of Social Security
managers said in an internal survey that they were uncomfortable
with deep staff cuts and most said staff morale was poor, a union
reported Friday.
   Kenneth T. Blaylock, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, released what he called a bootleg copy of the
survey and said, ``Dorcas Hardy got more than she bargained for in
this survey.''
   He said it backs up union complaints to Congress about the
Reagan administration's cuts in Social Security's staff. The
agency, which had nearly 80,000 workers in 1984, is now down to
69,345, with 6,000 more jobs slated for elimination by 1990.
   Phil Gambino, a spokesman for the Social Security
Administration, confirmed that Commissioner Dorcas Hardy ordered
the survey of her managers last August ``and it showed there is
quite a bit of concern and anxiety.''
   ``We're aware there are a lot of anxieties and we're going to
act on that,'' said Gambino. Hardy plans to start meeting in April
with managers in each of Social Security's 10 regions to discuss
their concerns.
   At the same time, Gambino said, ``the performance of our
employees is excellent and client satisfaction has never been
higher.'' A recent check by the General Accounting Office indicated
that most people are pleased with the service they get from Social
Security.
   According to AFGE, the survey was distributed to all 9,000
Social Security supervisors grades 14 or below, and more than 4,700
responded.
   Asked if they were comfortable with the way the agency was
managing staff cuts, 67.2 percent said they were not, 14.2 percent
said they were comfortable and 18.5 percent were undecided.
   Asked to judge employee morale, 53.5 percent said it was poor or
extremely poor. Fifty-five percent said they would not recommend
Social Security to friends as a good place to work.
   The union said some of the responses to the survey corroborated
AFGE's charges that Social Security encourages ``cheating'' to meet
productivity deadlines.
   It quoted one anonymous supervisor as writing on the
questionnaire: ``Everything looks great on paper, but the reality
is SSA is going to pot.''
   AFGE represents 60,000 Social Security workers.
   Blaylock said the survey was ``a strong testimonial for an
independent Social Security Administration run by competent career
federal employees instead of political appointees who know little
or nothing of what SSA is all about.''

<HEAD>Heart Inflammation Killed Pop Singer Andy Gibb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andy Gibb, the British-born pop singer and former
teen idol, died of heart inflammation and there was no evidence
that drugs or alcohol were involved, doctors said Friday.
   Constable Michael Harvey of the Oxford coroner's office said no
inquest would be held because Gibb died of natural causes.
   Gibb died Thursday at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, after
complaining of stomach pains. He was about to resume singing and
start recording for Island Records after years of personal and drug
problems.
   Brothers Robin, Barry and Maurice of the Bee Gees singing group
said the body ``will be flown back to his home in Los Angeles as
soon as possible and a memorial service will be held there.''
   ``All friends and family mourn the passing of this exceptionally
talented and well-loved artist,'' they said in a statement issued
through Robin Gibb's personal assistant, Ken Graydon.
   A hospital statement Friday said: ``Mr. Gibb died from
inflammation of the heart of the sort commonly caused by a virus.
There is no evidence that his death was related to drink or drugs.''
   The Bee Gees statement said: ``The family and friends of the
Gibbs are shocked by the untimely death of Andy Gibb. His passing
was completely unexpected.
   ``He died of myocarditis, a rare viral infection of the heart
muscle. This tends to occur without any warning and there is no
effective treatment. The pathologist found no evidence that alcohol
or other substances were implicated in any way.''
   Rob Partridge, publicist for Island Records Ltd., said Gibb
became ill last weekend and was admitted to the hospital
``essentially for observation.''
   ``Prior to him falling ill, I'm unaware of any heart condition
at all,'' Partridge said.
   Asked whether the record company was disturbed by speculation
about a drug-related death, he replied: ``Of course we are. We
wouldn't have signed anyone if there was the slightest suspicion of
any kind of drug use.
   ``The Andy Gibb we knew was bright and optimistic and very
ambitious for his new recording deal. He had just gained a pilot's
license. ... Those are not the kind of things drug addicts do.''
   Robin Gibb, 39, spoke to reporters Friday at London's Heathrow
airport. He was meeting his 72-year-old father, Hughie Gibb,
arriving from Los Angeles.
   ``There was no question of Andy using drugs,'' he said. ``I
don't know where that story came from, but there is absolutely no
truth in it. He was not using cocaine again.''
   The Oxford hospital said the two-time Grammy Award nominee died
at 8:45 a.m. Thursday.
   ``It was so unexpected,'' Robin Gibb said. ``Andy had been ill
with stomach pains for about four days.''
   In 1982, Andy Gibb said he became heavily involved in drugs and
dropped his career after the breakup of his highly publicized
relationship with television star Victoria Principal.
   Three years later, he entered the Betty Ford Rehabilitation
Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., for treatment of a cocaine habit.
   An obituary Friday in The Times of London said Gibb's ``immense
success could hardly have been founded on vocal qualities alone.''
   ``What sent the young fans wild was his pretty face, flowing
blond locks, and his lithe figure, which radiated the healthy,
tanned sex-appeal of a male Farrah Fawcett-Majors,'' the daily said.

<HEAD>Jackson Stumps South Carolina Ahead of Caucuses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson campaigned across his native
state on the eve of its Democratic presidential caucus, stressing
that his candidacy stands for blacks and whites.
   Jackson emphasized issues he said blacks and whites alike
believe in: raising the minimum wage, cleaning toxic waste dumps,
reducing the flow of drugs into the country, subsidizing day care
and saving the family farm.
   ``It's not so much black versus white as it is barracudas eating
us small fish. They don't eat fish by color. They eat fish by size.
   ``What makes South Carolina one today? We meet not in
confrontation. We meet at the plant gate ... we meet at the toxic
waste dump ... we meet on the corner where drugs are being
distributed and killing the people.''
   The candidate said a new challenge for the new South is to
``find common ground where the people can come together.''
   The South Carolina Education Association conference at a
Columbia motel was at a standstill as teachers waited in the halls
and entrances for more than an hour to see Jackson. The cooks and
maids stopped working to join the greeting line when the Greenville
native arrived.
   When he arrived, they screamed, cried, reached out to shake his
hand or just tried to touch him.
   ``I'm delighted to be home again,'' Jackson said as he stood on
a chair in an impromptu speech.
   ``You taught me,'' said the candidate who was educated through
high school in Greenville. ``You can have somebody in the White
House that you taught. Send me...''
   Jackson told crowds Friday that half of the states have held
primaries or caucuses and he has finished first or second in all
but a few of them.
   South Carolina and Louisiana were the only states Jackson won in
1984. Most political experts and campaign officials concede that
Jackson should win the lion's share of 44 delegates at stake
Saturday.
   A survey of Democratic chairmen and vice chairmen indicated
Jackson is the front-runner, with Gore a distant second.
   Twenty-five said Jackson was likely to win their counties, five
indicated they thought Gore would win their counties, two said Rep.
Richard Gephardt might win and none predicted Dukakis or Sen. Paul
Simon would win their counties.

<TEXT>
   When he became President Reagan's national
security adviser in October 1983, Robert C. McFarlane epitomized
the success that can come from a combination of luck, hard work,
smarts and having the right mentors.
   As the son of a Texas congressman, a U.S. Naval Academy
graduate, career Marine officer and protege of former secretaries
of state Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig, McFarlane had reached
the pinnacle of power.
   He mediated fights between the state and defense departments at
home and between Israel and its neighbors abroad, helped salvage
the MX nuclear missile and put out fires for the administration on
Capitol Hill.
   ``More than anyone else in this administration, Bud McFarlane is
the guy who has the confidence of members of Congress,'' Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., and chairman of the House Armed Service Committee,
said at the time.
   He had gotten the job despite opposition from conservative
ideologues who wanted it to go to former U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick. And no sooner did McFarlane get the job than it began
to unravel.
   Within a week, 241 U.S. Marines were killed in Beirut, and
McFarlane lost his first major dispute as national security chief.
Reagan sided with Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger to pull
out the Marines rather than retaliate militarily as McFarlane and
Secretary of State George P. Shultz urged.
   It only got worse. Disputes between McFarlane and new White
House chief of staff Donald T. Regan erupted, eventually leading to
McFarlane's resignation in December 1985.
   While citing personal reasons and the desire to spend more time
with his family as his reasons for resigning, McFarlane later told
interviewers that White House infighting made the job ``no longer
fun and professional'' and he complained that Reagan ``did not have
a great interest in foreign affairs.''
   Then there was Iran-Contra _ a scheme through which the
administration sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to finance
Nicaraguan rebels in violation of a congressional prohibition on
aiding them militarily.
   Although no one knew at the time, McFarlane was a central player
in those events both before and after he left the White House.
   On Friday, McFarlane, 51, agreed to plead guilty to four
misdemeanor charges of withholding information from Congress on the
administration's secret help to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   His plea was an appropriate epilogue to two years of drama that
included a secret flight to Tehran in May 1986 with plane load of
missile parts to be swapped for U.S. hostages, a suicide attempt
and sorrowful confessions that he bore the brunt of the blame for
the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``What really drove me to despair was a sense of having failed
the country,'' McFarlane told The New York Times upon his release
from the hospital after taking a overdose of the tranquilizer
Valium in February 1987.
   ``If I had stayed at the White House, I'm sure I could have
stopped things from getting worse,'' he said.
   Two months later in televised hearings, McFarlane told inquiring
congressmen and the nation how ``I regret and continue to regret
the mistakes I have made.''
   Because of his suicide attempt just two months earlier,
congressmen did not bore in on McFarlane as much as they did some
other witnesses. Maintaining a stoic presence, McFarlane complained
of being treated like ``a fragile flower'' and told his
questioners: ``Shoot your best shot.''
   While his testimony was viewed as being fuzzy on the details, he
became a model for the psychotherapy community.
   Psychologist Joyce Brothers praised him as a man ``who, though
there was nothing left for him ... is very heroic on the stand.''
   ``He's shown a great deal of ego strength ... after being
through the worst that life has to offer, near death,'' Ms.
Brothers said. ``People can see someone else who has been through
the valley and come out safely on the other side.''
   McFarlane also has been a model, as an achiever, in his earlier
secondary posts. After graduating from the Naval Academy in 1959,
he began a 20-year Marine Corps career that included stints at
strategy schools and war colleges here and abroad between tours of
combat duty in Vietnam.
   While still a Marine, he was brought into the White House as a
military and legislative aide to President Nixon, switching to then
national security adviser Henry Kissinger's staff and remaining
there when Brent Scowcroft succeeded Kissinger under President Ford.
   After President Carter's election, the Marine Corps sent
McFarlane to Okinawa. Unhappy with the assignment, he resigned in
1979 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and took a staff job with
the Senate Armed Services Committee, working primarily for Sen.
John Tower of Texas, then the panel's ranking Republican and later
its chairman.
   With Reagan's election in 1980, Secretary of Haig, as secretary
of state, hired McFarlane as his military counselor. When Reagan in
1982 named Undersecretary of State William P. Clark as his national
security adviser, McFarlane moved back to the White House as
Clark's deputy assistant.
   Twenty-one months later, Clark decided he would rather be
interior secretary and McFarlane was elevated to the top national
security job.

<HEAD>President Renews Threat To Veto Trade Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday renewed his threat
to veto trade legislation under consideration by a House-Senate
conference committee if it is ``anti-consumer, anti-jobs and
anti-growth.''
   Speaking to representatives of a trade coalition gathered in the
auditorium of the Old Executive Office Building, Reagan said, ``I
would note that on Tuesday, those who had predicted that
protectionism would be embraced in the South were proven wrong.''
   Reagan was referring to election returns on Super Tuesday in
which Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., a proponent of tough trade
sanctions against other nations, managed to win only one of 20
states, his homestate of Missouri.
   ``Too many backers of the trade bill talk about making America
more competitive but support provisions that would bench some of
the best competitors on our team,'' the president said. ``They talk
about saving jobs, but they want provisions that have the potential
to destroy thousands if not millions of American jobs.''
   Reagan said that any trade bill passed by Congress should not
violate accords the United States has signed in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   He also said the provisions of any such legislation should not
``provoke retaliation against our bombing export business,''
bringing a roar of laughter from the audience. Reagan quickly
corrected himself, saying, ``wait a minute _ our booming export
business.''

   Alaska Democrats gave Jesse Jackson a
narrow victory over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in a
precinct caucus preference poll, announced Friday.
   But it was the large bloc of uncommitted delegates that
generated the most interest among the presidential campaigners.
   With about 90 percent of Alaska's 442 precincts reporting,
Jackson claimed 872 delegates, or 34.9 percent of the total, to
Dukakis' 769 delegates, or 31 percent. A close third were the 768
delegates, or 30.8 percent, who remained uncommitted.
   The winners will attend 27 district caucuses on April 9-10,
selecting 390 delegates to attend the state convention in Fairbanks
on May 13-15.
   The 12 delegates emerging from the state convention will attend
the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta in July and will be
bound to a specific candidate at least for the first ballot. In
Atlanta the state also will have five ``super delegates,'' the
governor and four members of the Democratic National Committee.
   Commenting on the results of the preference poll, conducted
among delegates selected at the precinct caucuses Thursday night,
Bob Speed, executive director of the Alaska Democratic Party, said,
``That huge uncommitted figure represents a lot of people who want
to support a Democratic candidate but who haven't made up their
minds.''
   He added, ``The strong showing by the Jackson and Dukakis people
shows the level of their campaigns. It was the lack of organization
by the other candidates rather than apathy on the part of the
delegates that made them go uncommitted.''
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. finished far back with 47
delegates or about 2 percent, followed by Illinois Sen. Paul Simon
with 18 delegates, and Missouri Congressman Dick Gephardt, who had
16 delegates, less than 1 percent each.
   Russ Meekins, state chairman of the Dukakis campaign, said
organizers will be trying to sway the uncommitted delegates before
next month's district caucuses.
   As of now, counting the Gore, Simon and Gephardt supporters as
uncommitted for purposes of selecting national delegates, the
breakdown is five for Jackson, three for Dukakis and four
uncommitted.
   Henry Lancaster, statewide coordinator for the Jackson campaign,
said with blacks comprising just 3 percent of Alaska's population,
his candidate's appeal was based on the anti-drug and economic
issues he's been voicing around the nation.
   ``This state has a lot of working-class people who've come from
the South, the Midwest and the Northwest,'' Lancaster said. ``In
down times, people are looking for solutions. And this is a down
time.''
   That reference was to the collapse of Alaska's oil-fired
economy. About 85 percent of the state's budget is supported by oil
revenues, and world oil prices are less than half what they were
three years ago.
   The Democrats chose 2,496 delegates in caucuses around the state
Thursday night. The caucuses were open to any registered Democrat
and anyone who wished to register at the door.

<HEAD>Principal Miami Police Corruption Witness Gets 10 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former officer who was the principal witness in a
series of Miami police corruption trials was sentenced Friday to 10
years in prison for his part in a cocaine ripoff ring.
   Rodolfo Arias, 32, had pleaded guilty to tax fraud and
conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.
   ``His testimony has opened many cans of worms,'' U.S. District
Judge Kenneth Ryskamp said of Arias, who helped convict three
officers of drug-related corruption in the so-called Miami River
Cops trials in recent months.
   The case was named after the officers' most highly publicized
theft, a 1985 raid on a smuggling boat on the Miami River in which
three drug guards drowned after jumping into the water. The
officers stole millions of dollars in cocaine for resale.
   Arias' cooperation was also instrumental in obtaining a dozen
guilty pleas before the trials, as well as the suspension or
investigation of nearly 100 Miami officers whose names surfaced
during the investigation.
   ``When this plea agreement was signed, we never realized what
that cooperation will be. There will be more indictments yet to
come,'' said special federal prosecutor Russell Killinger.
   Arias could have received up to 20 years, but Ryskamp honored
the government's recommendation for a 10-year maximum.
   Arias will receive credit for time spent in the federal witness
protection program and could be free in five years, said his
attorney, Eugene Sauls.
   ``This court has ambivalent feelings about this case,'' said the
judge, acknowledging Arias' cooperation but adding that the former
officer's crimes ``cry out for retribution.''
   Another officer who cooperated with prosecutors received a
15-year sentence Friday. Carlos Pedrera, 27, had pleaded guilty to
the same counts.
   Arias and Pedrera were among a large group of officers the
Police Department was forced to hire quickly after the Mariel
boatlift and Liberty City riots in the early 1980s.
   Many of the officers worked the midnight shift, and Arias
testified that his increasingly corrupt group turned Miami's
streets into its private crime kingdom.
   The officers routinely took small quantities of drugs and cash
from suspects they detained, then expanded into stealing drugs
directly from dealers.

<HEAD>Eastern Forced to Cancel Some Flights Because of Pilot Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, embroiled in labor problems,
has been forced to cancel numerous flights because of a shortage of
pilots, and there is no sign the pilot drain is easing, an Eastern
executive testified Friday.
   Eastern's loss of pilots and details about the impact of that
loss were disclosed during testimony in a federal court hearing on
whether Eastern should be allowed to go ahead with plans to lease
26 Eastern jets to Orion Air, a North Carolina cargo carrier.
   The Air Line Pilots Association is asking the U.S. Court of
Appeals to stop the Eastern-Orion deal, claiming it is designed to
circumvent the pilots' labor contract. Eastern has said it wants
Orion to fly the planes with non-union pilots in case of a strike
at Eastern.
   In an attempt to show that Eastern is planning to lease only
spare aircraft to Orion, the Miami-based carrier produced internal
documents showing a sharp increase in the number of pilots who have
left the company.
   The departures and a high rate of sick leave by pilots at the
airline are leaving aircraft sitting idle, testified William R.
Croucher, Eastern's director of planning and administration.
   Eastern submitted to the court internal documents showing that
500 pilots left the company for various reasons in 1987, a number
that Croucher said is nearly 10 times the historical average pilot
attrition rate at the airline.
   He said so far this year, 259 Eastern pilots have either left
the company or have given notice to depart within 90 days. The
airline anticipates losing a total of 600 pilots this year,
according to Croucher.
   The pilots union has said previously that the labor turmoil at
Eastern and a push by management to seek labor concessions has
caused hundreds of pilots to seek early retirement or quit to join
other airlines even though they are sacrificing their seniority.
   The figures provided by Eastern in court Friday, however, are
the first details as to how serious the pilot drain has become at
the airline, which has about 4,000 pilots. Croucher said the
airline is hiring about 30 pilots a week, but that because of long
training periods, the number is inadequate to make up for the
losses.
   Croucher said the pilot shortage has forced Eastern to cancel
several thousand flying hours that had previously been scheduled
for March and April and to cut back total planned flying hours for
the rest of the year.
   During three days last month _ Feb. 26 through Feb. 28 _ Eastern
canceled a total of 135 single-point flights because no cockpit
crews were available.
   Judge Barrington D. Parker, who is hearing the Orion-Eastern
case, continued the matter until next Monday after granting a
pilots union request for internal Eastern documents on various
Eastern aircraft, including those that are to be leased to Orion.
   Eastern had refused to turn over the documents, claiming that
they could be used by the pilots union to gain information about
Eastern's plans in event of a strike. Parker directed that the
documents be made available only to the union's three lawyers and
two union members and that they not be copied.

   The Simbrah Association is being added to an
Agriculture Department list of registered cattle breeds so owners
can qualify for higher federal payments when animals are
slaughtered under the department's brucellosis eradication program.
   Brucellosis is a highly contagious disease, James W. Glosser,
acting administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, said Friday.
   ``Our experience has shown that indemnities encourage owners to
remove infected animals from their herds to prevent the spread of
the disease,'' Glosser said.
   Brucellosis can be passed on to humans _ where it is known as
undulant fever _ through raw milk from infected cows.
   Simbrah cattle are a cross between Simmental and Brahman, the
department said. Approximately 2,200 U.S. producers own registered
Simbrah cattle.
   The indemnity rate for all dairy cattle, and registered beef
cattle and bison is $250 per animal, while the payment for
non-registered beef and bison is $50 per animal.
   Officials said the new rule goes into effect on April 11.

   Republican Sen. Bob Dole, scrambling to salvage
his presidential campaign, challenged GOP front-runner George Bush
on Friday to show up for a live 30-minute television show Dole has
purchased for Saturday night.
   Earlier Friday, as he campaigned around Illinois, Dole vowed to
stay in the race at least through the state's primary on Tuesday,
though he said he would reassess his chances after that.
   Dole, who pulled most of his TV ads off the air in Illinois
earlier this week, said he had bought television time on a Chicago
station and would broadcast live from a small college in Galesburg,
Ill.
   He challenged Vice President Bush to join him there for a debate
at Knox College, which was the site of one of the famous
Lincoln-Douglas debates.
   Bush has declined Dole's repeated challenges to a one-on-one
debate. But Dole said, ``In any event, I'll be there to discuss the
issues. I dare George Bush to have a debate with Bob Dole.''
   Bush is tentatively scheduled to be in Galesburg Saturday night
to attend a GOP dinner.
   Earlier in the day, Dole had joked with reporters that he might
have a cardboard cutout of Bush on the stage if the vice president
wouldn't show up in person.
   ``We're hanging by our fingernails,'' Dole said at an airport
news conference in Moline. ``We need to somehow capture the
attention of the Illinois voters.''
   Dole, campaigning across central and western Illinois, denied
reports that he and his aides had discussed the possibility of
pulling out of the race. But he conceded there had been some
discussion of another less drastic option.
   ``There was some talk about maybe just canceling a couple of
days' events to heighten whatever we're going to do later,'' Dole
said at a stop in Bloomington, where he spoke to Illinois Farm
Bureau leaders.
   Dole said his deep staff cutbacks were ``just good management,''
made to save money and because most of the workers were no longer
needed after Super Tuesday.
   Campaign aides said Dole also was buying television time to air
ads on Sunday.
   Throughout the day, Dole made it clear that his task in
Illinois, if he is to overtake Bush, is to draw the vice president
out on issues and to separate him from the good will that many
Republicans feel for President Reagan.
   ``I'm sort of running against the ghost of Ronald Reagn,'' the
senator said.
   In addition, Dole said that Bush's victories on Tuesday had
given him a big boost in polls.
   ``What we need to do is slow down this Super Tuesday momentum,''
Dole said.
   One effort by Dole is to continue to press Bush to participate
in one-on-one debates even though the vice president has declined.
   ``If we could just discuss the issues in one state ... I will
win,'' Dole said. ``It's pretty hard to slow down a freight train
if you don't talk about the issues.''
   One issue on which he has pressed Bush is the vice president's
involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, a subject that was back in
the news Friday as former National Security Adviser Robert C.
McFarlane agreed to plead guilty to four misdemeanor charges that
he withheld information from Congress.
   ``It is going to revive that whole issue again and I've said
from the start that it's not going to go away. That's why it should
be addressed,'' Dole said. Bush ``is going to have all these things
happening through the summer,'' he said.
   One uncertain element in Dole's strategy is how Illinois voters
will react to the possibility that a Bush victory in their state
could effectively end the GOP nominating race. Dole maintains there
are many voters who have yet to decide which candidate they will
back.
   ``I know there are a lot of people, probably 20 percent, who are
just now beginning to focus on who the candidates are,'' said Dole.
``It's like last-minute Christmas shoppers. Some people don't even
know what they're going to buy until the last 24 hours and then
they buy whatever is left. We don't want that to happen.''
   Asked whether he would abandon the race if he loses next week,
Dole said, ``We will reassess after Illinois. I am going to be very
realistic about this.''

<HEAD>Bell Finalizes Agreement To Repay U.S. $88 Million in Overcharges</HEAD>

   The government and Bell Helicopter Textron
signed agreements Friday under which the Fort Worth, Texas, company
will pay $88 million to settle claims that it overcharged for
military helicopter spare parts.
   The settlement, disclosed earlier in the week, is considered one
of the largest ever in a defense contracting case.
   It resulted from inaccurate cost accounting information Bell
gave the government from October 1982 to October 1985, the Justice
Department said in a statement.
   The Justice Department's civil division and the Army each signed
separate agreements with the company.
   During the course of the investigation, Bell consistently
maintained that there was no wrongdoing. And the U.S. attorney's
office in Fort Worth said it notified Bell on Friday that the
office has declined criminal prosecution in the case.
   ``That effectively closes our case,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Ron Eddins said in Fort Worth. ``We did that because of all of the
factors that were disclosed during the investigation. Their coming
forward and agreeing to work things out with the Pentagon was a
part of it too.''
   Eddins said the Justice Department's civil fraud division ``has
also issued an agreement with them that accepts the payment and the
administrative agreement to settle the civil issue. The case is
closed there too.''
   Bell President L.M. Horner said the settlement, which he
described as ``encompassing issues well beyond those which were
investigated, cleans the slate and will allow for the normalization
of relations between Bell and the Army.''
   Under the settlement, Bell will pay the government $69 million
within the next 30 days. The government will also have its choice
of about $11 million in spare parts inventory. Additional
provisions of the agreement make it worth somewhere in the
neighborhood of $88 million, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, Dan
Howard, has said.
   Bell will forgo claims to about $6 million worth of interest on
contract progress payments withheld by the Army and about $1.5
million in legal fees. Offsetting that will be a $1.1 million
payment by the Army to Bell to cover a separate contract that got
sidelined in the dispute.
   Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman, has said most of the
overcharges came as a result of an accounting system used in
handling Army contracts. Bell switched to a computerized accounting
and inventory system that had the effect, among other things, of
accelerating the company's requests for Army progress payments for
work performed.
   Bell agreed to implement a new accounting system that met the
Army's approval in October 1985.

   Europe's Ariane 3 rocket lifted off
on schedule Friday night for a mission to place French and U.S.
communications satellites into orbit and reaffirm its role as the
West's only active launcher.
   The rocket blasted off at 7:28 p.m. from this jungle space
center on the northern coast of South America _ Ariane's 21st
launching and the first of eight planned for this year.
   Andre Payet, chief of mission, said no technical problems were
reported and weather conditions were good for the launch of the
rocket, owned by the European Space Agency.
   The launch was first scheduled for December but was delayed for
extra tests after anomalies were detected in the oxygen and liquid
hydrogen third-stage engine.
   ``We preferred to take the time to understand the problem,''
said Frederic d'Allest, president of Arianespace, ESA's commercial
arm.
   Third-stage engine failure was the cause of three of Ariane's
four failed launches _ in September 1982, September 1985 and May
1986. The last failure, the 18th launch, left the rocket grounded
for more than a year.
   The other failed launch occurred in May 1980 because of a
problem with the first-stage engine.
   Ariane produced a perfect 20th launch Nov. 21, 1987, but the
West German television satellite it placed into orbit developed
problems with its solar panels and is not fully operational.
   The 21st launch will thrust into orbit the American GTE Spacenet
Corp.'s fifth satellite, Spacenet III R-Geostar R01. The satellite
is aimed at increasing the company's wide-ranging
telecommunications services in the United States and help set up a
system of satellite communication with mobile units such as trucks,
cars and trains.
   Two transponders on Spacenet III purchased by The Associated
Press are to provide the New York-based news cooperative with
domestic satellite delivery services over the next 10 years. A
satellite being used is nearing the end of its operational service.
   The French Telecom IC, the third in a series of satellites owned
by France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications system, is
used for telephones, radio and television transmissions as well as
military communications.
   The new satellite is to replace Telecom 1-B, which broke down
Jan. 15.
   With the U.S. space shuttle grounded and Titan 4 and Delta
rockets not yet competitive, Ariane remains the only active
launcher for commercial satellites in the West. However,
Arianespace is watching the return of the Americans to the
lucrative space market as well as competition from the Soviet
Union, China and Japan.
   Including Friday's payload, Arianespace has 43 satellites on its
order books worth $2.36 billion, according to the company.
   To keep up with the orders, the Kourou space center has made two
launch pads available.
   Ariane's 21st launch is to be the first of eight this year, with
nine launches each planned for 1989 and 1990, d'Allest said earlier
this week.

   The Environmental Protection agency said
Friday it had approved field tests in Wisconsin for a genetically
engineered bacterium designed to improve the ability of alfalfa to
use nitrogen in the air as a fertilizer.
   The bacterium, Rhizobium meliloti, grows naturally on alfalfa
roots, and mutant forms have been used to enhance plant growth in
the past.
   Using the techniques of recombinant DNA, BioTechnica Inc. of
Cambridge, Mass. has re-inserted the genes responsible for nitrogen
use _ nitrogen fixation _ back into the organism, giving it two
copies of the genes.
   Lab and greenhouse tests indicate this will enhance alfalfa
yield, according to an EPA announcement when the company applied
for permission to test 13 months ago.
   EPA has an active regulatory program for genetically engineered
pesticides, but this bacterium is not a pesticide. It is the first
genetic engineering case under EPA's authority to regulate new
chemicals, and the test will precede under approval of the
company's ``premanufacture notice'' for a new chemical.
   The tests will be conducted in Pepin County, Wis., a county
lying on the Mississippi River about 20 miles southwest of Eau
Claire.

   Police Chief Jess ``Doc'' Hale was
suspended Friday after being charged with taking less than $200
from a drugstore cash register.
   Hale, 47, was released on his own recognizance after pleading
innocent to the misdemeanor charge. Trial was set for May 24. He
declined comment after the court appearance.
   Pulaski County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Lloyd King said Hale took
money over the past several weeks from Buice Drug Store, a popular
coffee stop for police officers.
   The amount was not disclosed, but the misdemeanor charge means
it was less than $200. Buice Drug Store is owned by state Rep.
George Wimberly.
   King said the prosecutor's office was tipped off by a resident
of the county, but he would not elaborate. Radio station KARN,
citing unidentified sources in the State Police, said police
secretly videotaped Hale taking money.
   City Manager Tom Dalton announced Hale's suspension with pay.
   ``When I have sufficient information to determine whether the
chief has violated the rules,'' Dalton said, ``I will at that time
make my decision as to whether or not to institute formal
disciplinary action against the chief.''
   Hale earns $64,070 a year and also collects a pension of $18,766
from the Police Department, from which he retired as an assistant
chief in 1982 after a 20-year career.
   He rejoined the force as chief 17 months ago after running the
Medicaid Fraud Division of the state attorney general's office.

   Sen. Paul Simon, insisting he has ``as good a
chance as anyone'' to become the Democratic presidential nominee,
campaigned Friday for home-state support in next Tuesday's Illinois
primary.
   Simon sought the votes of educators and college students in his
bid to beat Illinois rival Jesse Jackson, his chief challenger in
the state primary according to a new poll.
   ``We want to send a message to the nation from Illinois,'' Simon
said in asking educators to help him win the primary. ``Part of
that message is that for people who need quality education, this
administration has been out to lunch,'' he added.
   Next, it was off to Northwestern University in Evanston where he
drew applause from a crowd of about 1,000 students when he called
for increasing grants and government loans to college students.
   Saying again that he figures it will take more than one ballot
for the party to settle on a White House nominee at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta in July, Simon said at a North Side
pancake restaurant: ``I think I have as good a chance as anyone.''
   A Washington Post-ABC News poll published Friday said Simon and
Jackson were in a virtual dead heat in Illinois at 38 percent and
33 percent, respectively, among 402 likely Democratic voters, while
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was third at 16 percent. The
difference between Simon and Jackson was within the poll's margin
of error of plus or minus 8 percentage points.
   After being endorsed by the Polish Daily Zgoda, a Polish
language newspaper, Simon campaigned on friendly turf at the
Illinois Education Association's representative assembly meeting.
   Simon, who serves on the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee's subcommittee on education, arts and humanities, noted
that the educators' union had supported him in his successful 1984
bid to oust Republican Sen. Charles Percy against long odds.
   ``Four years ago when I was running for the U.S. Senate, there
was not a single poll that showed Paul Simon winning. But the IEA
hung in there and didn't listen to the polls and, believe it or
not, there was one final poll on a Tuesday that showed Paul Simon
winning,'' he said as the crowd applauded and cheered.
   He told the 750 union delegates and alternates what they wanted
to hear. If elected president, he said, he would seek to raise
teachers' salaries, improve preschool education programs and
increase public school funding. He also called for a ``massive
assault'' on illiteracy.
   ``I am the only candidate running for president who, either in
state legislative service or in congressional service, has ever
requested to be on the education committee,'' Simon said.
   ``I mention that to show you I'm not just giving you another
speech. I'm giving you a commitment to education that's been there
for my whole lifetime,'' Simon said.

<HEAD>Late Blizzard Wallops High Plains With Snow, High Winds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A powerful late-winter blizzard whitened the Black Hills of
South Dakota, with heavy snow and winds up to 65 mph barreling
through parts of that state, Colorado and Nebraska on Friday before
moving east into Minnesota.
   Blizzard warnings extended from northeast Colorado across the
Nebraska Panhandle and northwest Nebraska into much of South
Dakota. Parts of Interstate 80 in western Nebraska were shut down.
   In South Dakota, Rapid City reported winds of up to 65 mph and
heavy snow. Nearby Lead and Deadwood had up to 3 feet of snow.
Sturgis had 20 inches, Spearfish, 18, and Custer and Hill City 14.
   Snow and strong winds also hammered the Nebraska Panhandle
throughout the morning and afternoon. Wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph
reduced visibility to near zero. Crawford received up to 16 inches
of snow.
   The blizzard also blasted the northeast plains of Colorado,
where winds gusted to 50 mph at Wellington, Akron and Fort Morgan.
   Wind-chill readings across much of North Dakota, were from 10
below zero to 25 below. Some interstates were closed.
   Snow also continued to fall across much of Wyoming, where Rock
Springs received 15 inches, Laramie, 11, and Cheyenne, 7.
   The storm moved slowly northeastward into Minnesota, where up to
3 inches of snow was measured north of Bemidji. Wind gusts of 49
mph were reported at Duluth.
   Elsewhere, cloudy skies prevailed across much of the Great
Lakes, with some snow across Upper Michigan. The rest of the nation
enjoying pleasant weather, with the Southern Plains and Middle and
Lower Mississippi valleys logging temperatures in the 60s and 70s.
The Atlantic Coast states reported readings in the 50s and 60s.
   On the West Coast, skies were mostly clear, except for fog along
the Pacific Northwest coast. Southern California had wind gusts to
40 mph.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 88 at McAllen, Texas.
   Saturday's forecast called for the late-season storm system to
bring widespread showers and thunderstorms from the lower Ohio and
western Tennessee valleys into the lower Mississippi Valley and
western Georgia. Blowing snow was likely from the Middle Missouri
Valley into parts of the Great Lakes. Snow and sleet were forecast
for central Wisconsin, with rain across the lower Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley and scattered snow in the northern Plains and central
Rockies.
   High temperatures should be in the 20s, 30s or 40s across much
of the nation, dipping into the teens across the northern Plains
into northern Minnesota and reaching into the 50s and 60s from the
Pacific Northwest through the southern Rockies, northern Texas, the
middle Mississippi, lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys into parts of
the Middle Atlantic states. Highs should hit the 70s in Southern
California and parts of Texas across the lower MIssissippi Valley
and Gulf Coast region, the Southern Atlantic states and northern
Florida. Southern Texas and southern Florida should see highs in
the 80s.

<HEAD>Dole's Campaign `Hanging by Fingernails'; Hart Bows Out</HEAD>

debate, Subs 6th graf with 3 grafs, ``Dole bought...</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Republican Bob Dole tried to rescue a presidential candidacy
that was ``hanging by our fingernails'' on Friday and the
Democratic presidential race left behind Gary Hart, who
acknowledged ``the people have decided'' against him.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson continued to roll with a narrow victory
over Michael Dukakis in Alaska's precinct caucuses. He looked for
further encouragement in Saturday's caucuses in South Carolina, his
native state, and in Tuesday's primary in Illinois, his adopted
state.
   The Democratic sideshow in South Carolina aside, the
presidential campaign in both parties focused on Illinois. Its
primary posed an opportunity for George Bush to slam the door on
Dole's presidential hopes, and could present the Democrats with a
clearer race _ or a more muddled one.
   Trailing Bush badly in delegates and in polls in that state,
Dole pulled more than $200,000 in television ads off the air and
dismissed more than half his campaign staff.
   ``We're hanging by our fingernails,'' he said in Moline. ``We
need to somehow capture the attention of the Illinois voters.''
   Dole bought a half hour of live television time on a Chicago
station for Saturday night and said, ``I dare George Bush to have a
debate.''
   He pointed to the plea to Iran-Contra charges Friday by former
White House aide Robert C. McFarlane and said the Iran-Contra issue
won't go away for Bush.
   Dole said his campaign had between $1 million and $2 million on
hand. But he was reeling from his 17-state collapse on Super
Tuesday, when Bush won 16 of those states and took a giant step
toward the nomination.
   ``What we need is to slow down this Super Tuesday momentum,''
Dole said.
   ``We will reassess after Illinois,'' he added. ``I am going to
be very realistic about this.''
   The only other Republican left in the race, following Jack
Kemp's withdrawal a day earlier, was Pat Robertson. He campaigned
in Peoria, Ill., and vowed, ``I'm in it until New Orleans,'' where
the Republicans hold their convention.
   Bush campaigned with Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson at his
side, telling farm leaders he hoped to ``win as big in the land of
Lincoln as I did in the land of cotton.''
   He said he would decline a one-on-one confrontation with Dole,
recalling he tried that with Ronald Reagan in 1980 _ a meeting that
probably cost Bush the nomination.
   ``I may be older, but I'm a lot smarter now, too,'' he said.
   Hart ended his Democratic campaign for a second time, flanked by
family members at a Denver announcement.
   ``I got a fair hearing and the people have decided and now I
should not go forward,'' he declared.
   Hart's exit contained only a trace of the defiance that marked
his initial departure last May.
   Once the prohibitive front-runner for his party's nomination,
Hart dropped out the first time amid disclosures of his
relationship with Miami model Donna Rice. He returned to the race
in December, but he failed to win a single delegate and never
reached double-digit percentages in the primaries.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. continued his attacks on Dukakis, saying
the Massachusetts governor's lack of experience in foreign policy
means he'd be ``a president who needs on-the-job training.''
   ``His complete lack of experience in foreign policy is, I think,
a major issue at a time when the next president must be prepared to
seize the opportunities for a new relationship with the Soviets,''
Gore said.
   Dukakis said he hopes to get a share of Illinois' delegates and
demonstrate ``I can appeal to people all over the country.''
   Dukakis began airing a new commercial that spoke to the
possibility of a brokered convention being talked up by Paul
Simon's campaign. ``Some people would like to turn back the clock,
to go back to the days when the voters didn't really pick their
presidential nominee. They say you must turn over that power to
them, to use at a brokered convention,'' the narrator intones.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo also chimed in, saying Democrats
should get behind the candidate with the most delegates at the end
of the primaries, even if he doesn't have a majority.
   ``If Mike Dukakis has 41 percent, get everybody together in a
room and say, `Jesse, Gore, Gephardt, you came close, but Mike's
the candidate,''' Cuomo said. ``Let's pick the guy who's ahead
after California.''
   Democrat Richard Gephardt campaigned in Chicago and complained
about two rivals who hit him with a barrage of negative television
ads in the South.
   ``I feel like Dukakis and Gore have mugged me in an alley,'' he
said. ``They are borrowing my rhetoric, but they don't have any
substance behind it.''
   Jackson claimed 35 percent of the vote in a nonbinding
preference poll at Thursday night's Alaska caucuses. Dukakis was
next with 31 percent.
   Campaigning in South Carolina, Jackson urged blacks and whites
to unite around him.
   ``It's not so much black versus white as it is barracudas eating
us small fish,'' Jackson said. ``They don't eat fish by color. They
eat fish by size.''

   Former presidential aide Robert C. McFarlane
pleaded guilty Friday to misdemeanor charges that he misled
Congress by assuring lawmakers the Reagan administration was not
helping arm Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on U.S. military aid.
   President Reagan's former national security adviser pleaded
guilty to four counts of withholding information from Congress when
questioned about news reports that members of his staff,
particularly Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, were helping to raise money
and ship arms to the Contra rebels.
   McFarlane, who agreed to cooperate fully with independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's investigation, could be sentenced to up
to four years imprisonment and fined as much as $400,000 for the
guilty pleas he entered before U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.
Robinson Jr.
   Robinson released McFarlane on his own recognizance and did not
schedule a sentencing date. McFarlane was subdued and spoke in a
soft voice when responding to questions posed by the judge.
   ``You understand that imprisonment could be consecutive?''
Robinson said, referring to the option of making the four one-year
terms concurrent or consecutive.
   ``I understand that,'' McFarlane said without showing any
emotion.
   The judge later asked, ``Do you know any reason I should not
accept the plea?''
   ``No,'' McFarlane said.
   McFarlane played a major role in the Iran-Contra affair, even
after he resigned as national security adviser in December 1985.
The following May, he led a secret mission to Tehran to open
contact with so-called moderate Iranians who were thought to hold
influence with kidnappers of American hostages. He brought with him
a cake and a Bible signed by President Reagan.
   McFarlane attempted suicide in February 1987 by taking an
overdose of a tranquilizer the day before he was scheduled to
testify before a presidential commission investigating the affair.
   President Reagan, leaving the White House Friday afternoon for a
helicopter trip to Camp David, Md., refused to comment on
McFarlane's plea.
   ``It's in the court,'' he shouted to reporters.
   North, who is expected to be indicted for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, was asked by CBS News about McFarlane. ``I
wouldn't comment about Mr. McFarlane,'' North said. ``But as I
think I told you once before, this Marine is never going to plead
guilty to any charge and I'll fight this or any other allegations
of misconduct forever.''
   Earlier, in an impromptu news conference following the hearing,
Walsh acknowledged that McFarlane could have been charged with
perjury, a felony that carries a five-year sentence for each charge.
   But Walsh said he agreed to the misdemeanor plea because of the
former national security adviser's willingness to cooperate with
Walsh's investigation and his ``undisguised expressions of remorse
after the false testimony.''
   ``He tried to correct his testimony and actually imposed injury
upon himself in a fit of depression,'' Walsh said of McFarlane's
suicide attempt.
   Walsh called McFarlane's guilty plea a ``very important''
development in his 14-month investigation. In the coming weeks, the
investigation is expected to yield a round of indictments against
North and others, including Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, who was
McFarlane's successor as national security adviser.
   ``It furthers the work of the Office of Independent Counsel
because he has agreed to cooperate fully with our office in the
pursuit of the remainder of our investigation,'' Walsh said.
   McFarlane told reporters, ``I did indeed withhold information
from the Congress. I believe strongly that, throughout, my actions
were motivated by what I believed to be in the foreign policy
interest of the United States.''
   After the Iran-Contra affair unraveled in late 1986, McFarlane
said ``I believed profoundly that it was my personal obligation to
testify voluntarily and fully to those bodies formally established
to investigate this matter.''
   The charges involve statements that McFarlane made in three 1985
letters to House committees and in testimony before the House
Foreign Affairs Committee on Dec. 8, 1986, when he denied knowing
about solicitations of donations to the Contras from an
unidentified foreign country.
   The charges involve assurances to Congress that NSC staffers,
specifically North, were not involved in private efforts to help
the Contras and that McFarlane knew of no foreign donations to the
rebels.
   McFarlane admitted withholding information from the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in letters he wrote on
Sept. 5, 1985, and on Oct. 7, 1985, in response to queries about
reports that his staff was secretly helping the Contras in
violation of the 1984 Boland Amendment's ban on direct or indirect
military aid to the rebels.
   In the Oct. 7 letter, McFarlane wrote that ``Lieutenant Colonel
North did not use his influence to facilitate the movement of
supplies to the resistance.''
   He further assured the panel in the letter that there was ``no
official or unofficial relationship with any member of the NSC
staff regarding fund-raising for the Nicaraguan democratic
opposition.''
   ``This includes the alleged relationship with General
Singlaub,'' McFarlane said.
   The letter was misleading, the charge said, because McFarlane
knew that North ``had used his influence to facilitate the movement
of certain supplies to the Contras'' and he knew that ``a member of
the NSC staff had had contact with retired Maj. Gen. John K.
Singlaub regarding fund-raising for the Contras.''
   In the Sept. 5 letter, McFarlane told the panel ``I can state
with deep personal conviction that at no time did I or any member
of the National Security Council staff violate the letter or the
spirit of the law.''
   ``We did not solicit funds or other support for military or
paramilitary activities either from Americans or third parties,''
he wrote.
   He made a similar assurance in a Sept. 12, 1985, letter to
former Rep. Michael Barnes, D-Md., who then headed the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs.
   The fourth charge relates to Dec. 8, 1986, testimony in which
McFarlane told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that he was not
aware of any third country or citizens of a foreign nation helping
the Contras.
   ``The concrete character of that is beyond my ken,'' McFarlane
told the committee.
   The charge noted that McFarlane was withholding the fact he was
aware that citizens of the unidentified country had been donating
millions of dollars to the Contras. McFarlane also withheld the
fact that he had provided a representative of the country with the
number of a secret bank account where the funds could be deposited,
the charge said.
   McFarlane told the congressional Iran-Contra committees that as
early as May of 1984, he had met with the ambassador from what was
called Country 2, which later was learned to be Bandar bin Sultan
of Saudi Arabia.
   The ambassador offered to provide $1 million a month to sustain
the Contras at a time their money was running out. McFarlane told
the panels he had not solicited the money, but that it had been
offered as a gift after he bemoaned the likelihood of the Reagan
administration winning additional Contra support from Congress.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was 50 years Friday that the Nazis
annexed this country. Austrians honored the dead and demonstrated
against President Kurt Waldheim, who was made a silent spectator by
his questionable wartime past.
   Conservative and Socialist politicans emphasized that some
Austrians committed atrocities in the Nazi era, challenging the
long-held view that the nation was a victim of the Nazis. Huge
crowds cheered Adolf Hitler's troops when they marched into his
homeland March 11, 1938.
   A minute of silence drew little response Friday on the streets
of Vienna and few people turned out in the early morning to watch
political leaders lay wreaths at monuments to fallen soldiers and
victims of the Nazis.
   Shops, businesses and schools were open.
   About 300 protesters gathered outside the presidential offices
in the imperial Hofburg Palace, demanding that Waldheim resign, and
dozens vowed to hold a three-day vigil. Waldheim has said he will
not leave office until his term expires in 1992.
   At a memorial ceremony in the Hofburg, Foreign Minister Alois
Mock praised Waldheim as having given Austria ``prestige in the
world'' in his decade as U.N. secretary-general, which ended in
1982.
   Mock heads the conservative People's Party, which backed
Waldheim for president in 1986. He was the only official to mention
him directly at Friday's ceremonies marking the annexation, or
Anschluss.
   Waldheim was forced to cancel a speech at the ceremony because
of unresolved questions about whether he committed war crimes while
serving as a German army lieutanant in the Balkans in 1942-45. Some
prominent Austrians had said they would not attend if he spoke.
   Franz Vranitzky, the Socialist chancellor, told a special
Cabinet session Austrians must ``recognize the fact of historical
guilt (and) draw lessons from the past failures of society.''
   He dismissed the idea that Austria was just a victim of the
Nazis.
   Many Austrians unwillingly donned German uniforms, he said, but
others ``did not see a shameful coercion in this, but a simple test
of strength in which _ for the most varied reasons _ they fulfilled
their assigned duties.''
   Addressing about 900 students later, he urged young Austrians
not to ``make blanket accusations against an older generation or to
reproach them ... after the fact with moral mistakes, blindness,
bias and a lack of will to defend themselves.''
   He said one of the terrible aspects of Nazism was that it arose
in countries that regarded themselves as cradles of culture and
guarantors of Western traditions.
   Six of the seven parliamentary deputies of the small Greens
party walked out as soon as Waldheim entered a special session of
Parliament. The Greens invited Austrians to join them in marking
the anniversary at the site of a former concentration camp.
   In a leaflet, they said they boycotted the parliamentary
ceremony because Waldheim was there.
   ``On this particular day, the presence ... of a guest who `like
hundreds of thousands of others only did his duty,' is not
representative of the Austria we want to remember,'' the leaflet
said.
   The flier was referring to Waldheim's repeated declarations that
he was only doing his duty during the war.
   Waldheim kept his war past a secret until March 1986, when it
surfaced during his presidential campaign. A panel of historians
concluded last month that Waldheim was in close proximity to Nazi
war crimes but did nothing to prevent them.
   The report left open the question of Waldheim's guilt or
innocence in atrocities, and Waldheim has always denied wrongdoing,
but he has come under increased pressure to resign.
   Dozens of anti-Waldheim protesters chanted ``We do not accept
Waldheim, Resistance is our duty!'' as survivors of Nazi
concentration camps and resistance fighters met on the square where
the feared Gestapo had its Vienna headquarters.
   Speaking in front of a monument to the victims of Nazism, the
Socialist minister of social affairs, Alfred Dallinger, stressed
that ``not only those who can be clearly identified as perpetrators
were guilty.''
   ``Guilt was also shared by the many who allowed what was carried
out by others: those who ran along, who concurred, who adapted
themselves or looked away,'' he said, to loud applause.

   The 14th great-grandchild of matriarch Rose
Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy, was born Friday
morning at a District of Columbia hospital.
   Officials at the office of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said
the senator's niece _ Victoria Lawford Pender, 30, the daughter of
Pat Kennedy Lawford and the late actor Peter Lawford _ gave birth
to an eight-pound, nine-ounce girl at 6:30 a.m. at Georgetown
University Hospital.
   The infant, named Alexandra Lawford Pender, was due on the day
of the Super Tuesday presidential primary elections but arrived a
few days late.
   Ironically her mother, Victoria, was born on Election Day in
1958 when her uncle John Kennedy won re-election to the Senate from
Massachusetts.
   Pender is married to Washington attorney Robert Pender.
   Officials say both mother and child are well.

<HEAD>Racy New York Post Will Try to Add Some Panache, New Publisher
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Post will add some panache to its
blue-collar image built on sex and crime, the tabloid's new
publisher promised Friday.
   ``We don't want to emasculate the New York Post,'' Peter O.
Price told the City Club, a civic group. But he added: ``Our
challenge is to make the New York Post noticed for the right
reasons and not for the wrong reasons.''
   The improved Post, he said, will aim for depth in its writing, a
Manhattan focus, an even beefier sports section and more positive
stories about education and race relations. It might also launch a
Sunday edition, he said.
   The Post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, officially became the property of developer Peter
Kalikow on Monday.
   Australian-born newspaper baron Rupert Murdoch, who had owned it
since 1976, sold the money-losing tabloid to comply with federal
regulations barring ownership of a TV station and a newspaper in
the same city. Murdoch owns WNYW.
   ``Murdoch's Post was loud, lively and controversial. His British
tabloid style relied heavily upon sex, crime and violence,'' Price
said. ``Many advertisers ... refused to place ads in the newspaper,
which they considered out of step with the image they were trying
to portray.''
   Price said the emphasis on what some regard as ``terribly lurid
things'' is ``perhaps not so bad as people may think.''
   ``The pulse of journalism in the New York Post is that sense of
the city, that savvy, provocative, bold quality that's very often
talked about pejoratively because of Rupert Murdoch,'' he said.
   ``It very often gets people upset. But it certainly does not go
unnoticed. Our challenge is to make the New York Post noticed for
the right reasons and not for the wrong reasons.''
   Kalikow paid $37.6 million for the paper, which has been losing
money and circulation for years. It was founded in 1801 by
Alexander Hamilton.
   Kalikow acquired the Post only after the paper's 10 unions
agreed to a $22 million package of concessions, including a
last-minute gift of $3 million from Murdoch.

<HEAD>Canada Rejects Changes To Code That Bars U.S. Plywood Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp. has
refused to revise building codes that have effectively barred
American manufactured plywood from being used in Canada, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
   A change in the Canadian building codes is a key part of the
plywood provisions in the proposed U.S.-Canada free trade agreement
and Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore, said that Congress will have to get
tough with the Canadians in writing provisions to implement the
agreement.
   Rep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., said he was disappointed in the
Canadian decision and that while he thought the overall free trade
agreement was a ``excellent package, on this provision our
negotiators got taken to the cleaners.''
   Claire Buchanan, a Commerce Department spokeswoman, declined
comment but said the decision was under review.
   The Reagan administration had linked the elimination of plywood
tariffs on both sides of the border to a revision in construction
regulations by the CMHC, a government-controlled mortgage authority.
   Canadians insist American plywood is not sturdy enough to
withstand the harsh climate of Canada, a claim officials of the
American plywood industry say is unfounded.
   Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., called the Canadian refusal
``protectionism plain and simple.''
   ``If the administration gives into this, they are just
confirming it will be one-way free trade and that will be a
disaster for the Northwest plywood industry,'' DeFazio said.
   While construction sponsored by CHMC accounts for only 10
percent of Canada's construction plywood market, administration
officials had hoped it would be a ``foot in the door'' for American
plywood manufacturers and that changes would eventually be made in
other building codes that have restricted U.S. imports.
   ``The door got slammed today,'' Wyden said. ``This represents a
major inequity in the free trade agreement and it is just more
fodder for our position that we need tough enabling legislation.''
   Oregon is the top plywood producing state in the nation.
   Wyden, DeFazio and other Northwest congressmen, at a House
subcommittee hearing earlier this week, had warned that the free
trade agreement would do little to open the Canadian market to
American-maufactured plywood while at the same time it would give
Canadian plywood manufactuers unrestricted access to American
markets.
   The agreement calls for the total elimination of the 20 percent
U.S. tariff on Canadian plywood and the 15 percent Canadian tariff
on U.S. plywood over 10 years.
   Wyden and others have suggested that a provision be inserted in
the treaty's implementing language that would call for a review of
American access to the Canadian market before U.S. tariffs are
totally eliminated.
   ``It looks like that's the way we will have to go,'' Wyden said.

   Prince Charles flew home Friday with the body of a
friend who was killed by a Swiss avalanche that nearly engulfed the
future king as it roared down a mountain in a ``terrifying matter
of seconds.''
   With Maj. Hugh Lindsay's pregnant widow, Sarah, the prince
watched as six soldiers from his dead friend's Royal Lancers
regiment bore the flag-draped coffin from the red and white jet of
the Queen's Flight.
   The 39-year-old heir to the throne was praised for helping save
the life of another skier in his party but called foolhardy for
skiing perilous slopes off the main trails of the Klosters resort.
   A private funeral service in Devon was being arranged for
Lindsay, but no date was announced. Independent Television News
reported that Lindsay, an avid cricket player, had said he wanted
his ashes to be scattered on the cricket ground in his home town of
Budleigh Salterton.
   Charles, his wife, Princess Diana, and sister-in-law, Sarah, the
Duchess of York, all dressed in black, walked under leaden skies
from the jet at Northolt air base near London.
   They were met by Mrs. Lindsay, 34, a Buckingham Palace press
officer who had helped answer inquiries about Thursday's accident
before discovering her husband had died.
   She and Lindsay, also 34, were married last summer and she
expects a baby in May. He was a former aide to Queen Elizabeth II,
the prince's mother.
   In a handwritten statement read to reporters at the Zurich
airport after the royal party left, Charles said he and five
companions were skiing ``at our risk and we all accepted ... that
mountains have to be treated with the greatest respect and not
treated lightly.''
   When the avalanche started ``with a trememdous roaring'' he and
three others skied out of its path, Charles said.
   Then, ``to my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson just failed to ski clear and were swept away in a
whirling maelstrom as the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past
us to the valley below. It was all over in a terrifying matter of
seconds.''
   He described helping dig Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson out of the
snow with a shovel, then with his hands. Both of her legs were
broken and she is hospitalized in Switzerland.
   The royal party cut the skiiing holiday short. It began Tuesday
and ended tragically at 2:45 p.m. Thursday when the avalanche
hurtled down the mountain toward Charles; Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson;
her husband, Charles; Lindsay; Swiss guide Bruno Sprecher; and a
Swiss policeman.
   They were skiing off the main track between the treacherous
Gotschnawang and Drostobel trails at an altitude of about 5,800
feet when the snowslide began about 300 feet above them. Officials
had warned of avalanche danger at 5,200 feet and higher.
   ``Herr Sprecher acted with incredible speed and total
professionalism,'' the prince said. ``He skied down as fast as
possible, having told the Swiss policeman to radio for assistance.''
   Sprecher located Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson by a beeper on her body.
   ``Mr. Palmer-Tomkinson and I skied down and just arrived as Herr
Sprecher had reached Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson's head,'' the statement
said. ``He gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and revived her.
He gave me the shovel to dig her out and I tried using my hands as
well.
   ``At this point I sat with Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson while he
(Sprecher) quickly went to try and locate Maj. Lindsay. He found
him about 15 yards above Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson, but tragically he
had been killed outright during the fall.''
   Mrs. Lindsay left the Northolt base with her father. She was
carrying a bag apparently containing some of her husband's
belongings that the Duchess of York had given to her.
   Prince Charles departed for Windsor Castle, 20 miles away, to
see the queen and Diana and the Duchess of York went to Kensington
Palace.
   ``Thereafter their movements for the weekend are private,''
Buckingham Palace said.
   The accident highlighted the sometimes risky behavior of
Britain's royals.
   Hours before the avalanche, the Duchess of York, 28 and four
months pregnant, took a bad fall skiing.
   That night, the Royal Navy ship on which her husband, Prince
Andrew, is serving lost a helicopter with two crewmen off Portugal.
Andrew, younger brother of Charles, was not involved but he is a
helicopter pilot.
   The avalanche was the worst accident for the royal family since
Prince William of Gloucester, a cousin of the queen, died in a
crash during an air race in 1972.
   Newspapers clamored on Friday for Charles and other members of
the royal family to give up dangerous pursuits.
   ``Why was he there?'' the tabloid Sun asked. ``Charles has
consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly
slopes.''
   Charles is an ardent polo player who has taken many falls, and
had a near-collision while flying a plane. On his first parachute
jump he snarled the rigging and fell several thousand feet before
untangling it.

<HEAD>L.A. Police Ram `Rock' Houses; Seize Drugs and Suspected Dealers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Police Department rolled out its fabled
battering ram after a two-year absence to break into two fortified
houses where crack allegedly was being sold.
   Civil-rights lawyers who in 1986 forced police to garage the ram
expressed satisfaction with the way the use of the armored vehicle
was authorized under new guidelines but promised to keep a close
watch on future deployments.
   In a Thursday night raid, police used the vehicle with a 14-foot
metal pole to smash into a house in south central Los Angeles.
Officers arrested five suspected drug dealers and seized drugs,
weapons and hundreds of dollars in cash.
   Police also raided four other houses without the ram in the same
operation and took more than 25 people taken into custody.
   On Wednesday night, police seized about $10,000 worth of cocaine
and about $500 in marijuana after ramming into another south
central house where rock cocaine, a crystalline form of the drug
also called crack, allegedly was being sold.
   ``It was the most heavily fortified rock house we've seen in a
couple of years,'' said police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth. The
house was reinforced with gun turrets, metal bars and steel mesh,
he said.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates, who arrived after the Thursday night
raid, pointed out the security measures used by the suspected drug
dealers.
   ``See how the bolts come all the way through?'' Gates said,
pointing to a steel-barred window. ``There's no way you can pull
those bars off. You need a ram.''
   Police said they had not used the ram in drug raids since
February 1986. They wheeled it out in October when an armed man
barricaded himself in a house, but did not use it.
   Joan Howarth, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union
who had challenged the Police Department's use of the ram and
forced its suspension, said she was satisfied with the way it was
used.
   ``The judge told the LAPD it could not use the ram until they
did a surveillance of the locale to make sure there were no
children present,'' she said.
   Ms. Howarth had represented a woman whose house was the first
target of the ram, in 1985. The ram burst into a room only moments
after the woman's 5-year-old son and two other children left it.
   As a result of that case, the state Supreme Court ruled that
police must get a judge's certification and a search warrant before
using the ram, a ruling the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in October.
   Booth said obtaining judicial approval for use of the ram this
week was not difficult.
   ``We just don't run up and use it. Part of our tactics is to
make a purchase just minutes before entering,'' which enables
undercover officers to look inside the house, he said.
   The ram has become a featured part of TV shows and films. In
last summer's ``Dragnet'' movie, it was used to raid a suspected
drug factory that turned out to be a dairy processing plant.

   The United Nations issued a strong protest
at the U.S. decision Friday to go ahead with closing the Palestine
Liberation Organization's observer mission.
   The PLO called it a ``stab in the back'' to the Middle East
peace process.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert Okun informed Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar of the Justice Department decision Friday morning,
said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   He said Perez de Cuellar ``strongly protested this violation of
the headquarters agreement,'' the 1947 treaty under which New York
became home to the United Nations.
   The U.S. State Department also has said closing the PLO mission
would violate the pact, and even America's closest allies have
denounced the closure. Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar's legal staff
is studying several options. He refused to elaborate, but one
possibility would be a legal challenge when the Justice Department
seeks a court order closing the mission.
   Zehdi Labib Terzi, the PLO's United Nations observer, said the
PLO would not challenge the Justice Department move in court.
   ``We will not go into American court. We will have nothing to do
with American courts,'' he told reporters after meeting with U.N.
legal advisers. ``This is a matter between the United States and
the United Nations.''
   He said the PLO would ask Arab nations to request a meeting of
the General Assembly to consider whether U.N. headquarters should
remain in New York.
   Calling the U.S. decision a ``stab in the back'' to Mideast
peace efforts, Terzi asked, ``How could the United States really
look like a peace broker when they want to throw out the
representative of the Palestinian people, which is the principle
party to the conflict?''
   The letter Okun handed Perez de Cuellar said the Justice
Department will initiate legal action to close the mission around
March 21. It said the United States will not try to shut the
offices until the litigation ends.
   The mission is located in a four-story townhouse the PLO owns on
Manhattan's fashionable Upper East Side.
   The United Nations released copies of Okun's letter at a
briefing.
   The United States has refused binding arbitration of the
dispute, its worst with United Nations.
   At a special meeting last week, the 159-nation General Assembly
asked the World Court in The Hague to rule on whether the United
States must agree to arbitration. Arguments before the court are
set for April 11.
   Congress passed an anti-terrorism law in December ordering the
mission closed by March 21.
   U.N. officials and many diplomats regard the threat to the PLO
mission as a challenge to the independence of the United Nations.
   ``It's a very serious development,'' said Norwegian Ambassador
Tom Eric Vraalsen. ``It goes beyond the PLO because it violates the
headquarters agreement.''
   Several Arab diplomats have suggested moving the General
Assembly to Geneva if the mission is shuttered. Other diplomats say
Western nations probably would block such a step.
   Last year, the State Department closed down the only other PLO
office in the United States, a Washington information office, in an
attempt to head off legislation to close the U.N. mission.
   The United States and Israel consider the PLO a terrorist
organization. The United Nations recognizes it as the only
legitimate representative for Palestinians.

   The pilot of the Continental Express commuter
plane that crashed near Durango, Colo. in January, killing nine
people, had traces of cocaine in his urine and evidence of the
drug's by-products in his blood, the National Transportation Safety
Board said Friday.
   It appeared to be the first such accident involving U.S.
commercial airlines in which evidence of drug use by the pilots had
been found, aviation authorities said.
   The board did not characterize the finding as a cause of the
accident or indicate whether the pilot might have been impaired.
Investigators have not determined whether the pilot or co-pilot was
flying the airplane at the time of the accident.
   Nine people, including both crew members, perished in the Jan.
19 crash. The eight survivors were rescued after one of them, Peter
Schauer, trudged 1{ miles over a snowy mountainside to a house.
   Dr. Merrit M. Birky, an NTSB chemist, said the cocaine found in
the pilot's body ``is a small amount,'' but he declined to comment
further.
   Dr. Sorell L. Schwartz, a pharmacology professor at Georgetown
University, said that based on the amounts of the traces found, the
pilot was not under the influence of cocaine at the time of the
accident.
   Schwartz also said it was unlikely that a habitual user of the
drug would feel any lingering effects from the amounts of cocaine
detected in the pilot's body.
   ``There can be impairments,'' he said. ``There can be impaired
mental function, but that's not usual.''
   The potential impairments could include a sense of well-being,
he said.
   Safety board spokesman Alan Pollock declined to characterize the
findings.
   ``This investigation continues, and has quite a long way to
go,'' he said. ``We don't expect to find a probable cause for a
number of months.''
   He noted that investigators have not determined whether the
pilot, Steven S. Silver, 36, of Denver, was operating the
twin-engine turboprop aircraft when it plummeted into a mountainous
part of southeastern Colorado about 10 miles east of Durango.
   Test results on the co-pilot, Ralph Harvey, 42, of Denver, are
expected within the next two weeks, Pollock said.
   The tests showed that Silver's blood contained 22 nanograms per
milliliter of benzoylecgonine, a by-product of the body's breakdown
of cocaine. A nanogram is one-billionth of a gram.
   Silver's urine contained the same amount of cocaine, and 1,800
nanograms per milliliter of the by-product. No other drugs were
detected.
   Schwartz said cocaine leaves the body quite quickly, with half
of it being removed every 45 minutes. He said that based on the
information, he could not estimate how much cocaine had been used
or when.
   Silver was an employee of Trans-Colorado Airlines Inc. of
Colorado Springs, which leases planes and crews to Rocky Mountain
Airways, a Continental Airlines subsidiary that operates in
Colorado as Continental Express.
   Bill White, a Denver attorney speaking for Trans-Colorado, said
the company was ``obviously surprised. We're concerned.'' White
said he did not know how long Silver had been a pilot for
Trans-Colorado.
   ``There is certainly no way the company would condone anything
like that (cocaine use),'' he said. ``If there had been any
indication, he (Silver) would not have been on the payroll. It's
not the type of thing you do more than one time and get another
chance.''
   The Air Line Pilots Association said it was ``deeply disturbed''
by the report and added that ``this would be the first instance
where drug use by a pilot was shown to be the cause of an accident
at a U.S.-scheduled airline.''
   The association, which represents the pilots of the nation's
major airlines, said, however, the report ``leaves unanswered more
questions that it resolves.''
   ``Before we draw any conclusions, we must determine the accuracy
of the report, eliminate the possibility of a false positive
reading, determine the quantity and recency of the dosage,
determine whether the pilot was actually impaired at the time of
the accident, and then demonstrate that the impairment, if any,
played a role in the accident,'' said ALPA president Henry Duffy.
   George James, president of Airline Economics Inc., a Washington
consulting firm to the airline industry, said he was not aware of
another commercial airline accident in which drug use had been
involved.
   Just Thursday, the Department of Transportation proposed a drug
testing program for more than a half million airline employees.
   In a statement released by his office, Transportation Secretary
James Burnley called the incident ``a tragic reminder that not even
commercial aviation is exempt from the drug abuse problem which
plagues our society.''
   The Fairchild-Swearingen Metroliner crashed at about 7:30 p.m.
in light snow as it was approaching LaPlata County Airport in
Durango. The flight originated in Denver.

   Wyoming on Friday became the last state to
raise its drinking age to 21.
   Gov. Mike Sullivan signed into law a bill raising the age from
19 effective July 1.
   ``When this becomes effective, we will no longer be an island,''
he said. ``It is in the best interests of the state, the country
and, foremost, in the best interests of the young people of this
state.''
   The signing marks the end of several years of debate on the
issue in the Legislature, which has been unable to pass such
legislation largely because of arguments that Wyoming should not
give in to ``federal blackmail.''
   Wyoming stood to lose $8.2 million in federal highway funds
immediately if the increase were not in place in July.
   The government would continue to withhold funds until the state
adopted the increase, which was called for in a 1984 federal law.

<TEXT>
   Albert Gore Jr., calling himself the
candidate with campaign momentum that will eventually carry him to
the presidency, said Friday he expects to do extremely well in
South Carolina's Democratic caucuses Saturday.
   The Tennessee senator, campaigning in the state's largest cities
on caucus eve, told a crowd of a few hundred supporters at the
Statehouse that his strong Super Tuesday showing, when he won six
of the 21 Democratic events, surprised everyone.
   ``I believe that momentum is going to continue right through the
convention in Atlanta and right through November,'' he said. ``I'm
excited about the possibility of victory.''
   Gore is expected to finish a strong second to Jesse Jackson in
the South Carolina caucuses.
   Asked what state in the North he could win to prove he is not
just a Southern regional favorite, Gore refused to be specific,
saying only that he figured he would do well in Illinois and
Michigan.
   Gore said he has been in South Carolina more than any of the
other candidates and his campaign has bought the most television
ads in the days before the caucus sessions.
   ``We have worked very hard in this state and I think we have an
opportunity to extremely well here,'' Gore said.
   Gore noted that he supported legislation to restrict the growth
of textile imports. Such imports have caused plant closings and job
losses in the state's largest industry.
   Current textile trade agreements are being ``brazenly
violated,'' Gore said, adding that as president he would be sure
that agreements are enforced.
   In the upstate Friday, Gore spoke to textile employees in Lyman
where he said the Reagan administration is aiding the wealthy in
the hope that others will eventually benefit.
   ``Rather than asking what's best for those who are already well
off, I want to ask what is best for the man and the woman who work
in the textile mills, who work in the apparel industry, the person
who is behind the typewriter, the small businessperson, the small
farmer, and the person at the grass roots,'' he said.

   Former presidential aide Robert C. McFarlane
pleaded guilty Friday to misdemeanor charges that he misled
Congress by assuring lawmakers the Reagan administration was not
helping arm Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on U.S. military aid.
   President Reagan's former national security adviser pleaded
guilty to four counts of withholding information from Congress when
questioned about news reports that members of his staff,
particularly Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, were helping to raise money
and ship arms to the Contra rebels.
   McFarlane, who agreed to cooperate fully with independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's investigation, could be sentenced to up
to four years imprisonment and fined as much as $400,000 for the
guilty pleas he entered before U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.
Robinson Jr.
   Robinson released McFarlane on his own recognizance and did not
schedule a sentencing date. McFarlane was subdued and spoke in a
soft voice when responding to questions posed by the judge.
   ``You understand that imprisonment could be consecutive?''
Robinson said, referring to the option of making the four one-year
terms concurrent or consecutive.
   ``I understand that,'' McFarlane said without showing any
emotion.
   The judge later asked, ``Do you know any reason I should not
accept the plea?''
   ``No,'' McFarlane said.
   McFarlane played a major role in the Iran-Contra affair, even
after he resigned as national security adviser in December 1985.
The following May, he led a secret mission to Tehran to open
contact with so-called moderate Iranians who were thought to hold
influence with kidnappers of American hostages. He brought with him
a cake and a Bible signed by President Reagan.
   McFarlane attempted suicide in February 1987 by taking an
overdose of a tranquilizer the day before he was scheduled to
testify before a presidential commission investigating the affair.
   President Reagan, leaving the White House Friday afternoon for a
helicopter trip to Camp David, Md., refused to comment on
McFarlane's plea.
   ``It's in the court,'' he shouted to reporters.
   North, who is expected to be indicted for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, was asked by CBS News about McFarlane. ``I
wouldn't comment about Mr. McFarlane,'' North said. ``But as I
think I told you once before, this Marine is never going to plead
guilty to any charge and I'll fight this or any other allegations
of misconduct forever.''
   Earlier, in an impromptu news conference following the hearing,
Walsh acknowledged that McFarlane could have been charged with
perjury, a felony that carries a five-year sentence for each charge.
   But Walsh said he agreed to the misdemeanor plea because of the
former national security adviser's willingness to cooperate with
Walsh's investigation and his ``undisguised expressions of remorse
after the false testimony.''
   ``He tried to correct his testimony and actually imposed injury
upon himself in a fit of depression,'' Walsh said of McFarlane's
suicide attempt.
   Walsh called McFarlane's guilty plea a ``very important''
development in his 14-month investigation. In the coming weeks, the
investigation is expected to yield a round of indictments against
North and others, including Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, who was
McFarlane's successor as national security adviser.
   ``It furthers the work of the Office of Independent Counsel
because he has agreed to cooperate fully with our office in the
pursuit of the remainder of our investigation,'' Walsh said.
   McFarlane told reporters, ``I did indeed withhold information
from the Congress. I believe strongly that, throughout, my actions
were motivated by what I believed to be in the foreign policy
interest of the United States.''
   After the Iran-Contra affair unraveled in late 1986, McFarlane
said ``I believed profoundly that it was my personal obligation to
testify voluntarily and fully to those bodies formally established
to investigate this matter.''
   In an interview later with NBC News, McFarlane sidestepped a
question as to whether he thought President Reagan might pardon him.
   ``That's not for me _ and I don't think it ought to be for the
American people _ the issue. I guess that's really my central
concern (is) ... why this really happened, and to see if we can't
correct the way we do business between the president and the
Congress so that this kind of thing doesn't happen again,''
McFarlane said.
   The charges involve statements that McFarlane made in three 1985
letters to House committees and in testimony before the House
Foreign Affairs Committee on Dec. 8, 1986, when he denied knowing
about solicitations of donations to the Contras from an
unidentified foreign country.
   The charges involve assurances to Congress that NSC staffers,
specifically North, were not involved in private efforts to help
the Contras and that McFarlane knew of no foreign donations to the
rebels.
   McFarlane admitted withholding information from the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in letters he wrote on
Sept. 5, 1985, and on Oct. 7, 1985, in response to queries about
reports that his staff was secretly helping the Contras in
violation of the 1984 Boland Amendment's ban on direct or indirect
military aid to the rebels.
   In the Oct. 7 letter, McFarlane wrote that ``Lieutenant Colonel
North did not use his influence to facilitate the movement of
supplies to the resistance.''
   He further assured the panel in the letter that there was ``no
official or unofficial relationship with any member of the NSC
staff regarding fund-raising for the Nicaraguan democratic
opposition.''
   ``This includes the alleged relationship with General
Singlaub,'' McFarlane said.
   The letter was misleading, the charge said, because McFarlane
knew that North ``had used his influence to facilitate the movement
of certain supplies to the Contras'' and he knew that ``a member of
the NSC staff had had contact with retired Maj. Gen. John K.
Singlaub regarding fund-raising for the Contras.''
   In the Sept. 5 letter, McFarlane told the panel ``I can state
with deep personal conviction that at no time did I or any member
of the National Security Council staff violate the letter or the
spirit of the law.''
   ``We did not solicit funds or other support for military or
paramilitary activities either from Americans or third parties,''
he wrote.
   He made a similar assurance in a Sept. 12, 1985, letter to
former Rep. Michael Barnes, D-Md., who then headed the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs.
   The fourth charge relates to Dec. 8, 1986, testimony in which
McFarlane told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that he was not
aware of any third country or citizens of a foreign nation helping
the Contras.
   ``The concrete character of that is beyond my ken,'' McFarlane
told the committee.
   The charge noted that McFarlane was withholding the fact he was
aware that citizens of the unidentified country had been donating
millions of dollars to the Contras. McFarlane also withheld the
fact that he had provided a representative of the country with the
number of a secret bank account where the funds could be deposited,
the charge said.
   McFarlane told the congressional Iran-Contra committees that as
early as May of 1984, he had met with the ambassador from what was
called Country 2, which later was learned to be Bandar bin Sultan
of Saudi Arabia.
   The ambassador offered to provide $1 million a month to sustain

the panels he had not solicited the money, but that it had been
offered as a gift after he bemoaned the likelihood of the Reagan
administration winning additional Contra support from Congress.

   President Augusto Pinochet on Friday
rejected an opposition demand to allow more than one candidate to
run for president, saying it would create ``chaos and anarchy.''
   Pinochet, the army commander who has ruled Chile since a 1973
coup, vowed to carry out the government's plan for a single
candidate in a yes-or-no plebiscite sometime this year.
   Pinochet made the remarks in an address to the nation to mark
the seventh anniversary of the military-drafted constitution, which
the opposition wants amended.
   In a pre-dawn attack before Pinochet's speech, leftist
guerrillas fired submachine guns and at least two rocket grenades
at a suburban Santiago police station, wounding two officers and
three civilians, officials reported.
   They said several ``extremists'' in two cars carried out the
attack and one of the injured policemen was in serious condition.
   Officials reported three other guerrilla attacks early Friday in
the Santiago area, but no casualties.
   Another police station and a patrol car were fired at, they
said, and at least four electric-power pylons were damaged by
bombs, blacking out some neighborhoods.
   Army patrols in combat gear were deployed in this capital city
of 4.5 million people before Pinochet's speech, which was broadcast
on national radio and television.
   According to the constitution, the commanders in chief of the
army, navy and air force and the head of the national police will
pick a single presidential candidate for a yes-or-no vote.
   Pinochet, 72, is allowed by the constitution to seek election
for the 1989-97 term, and appears to be seeking the nomination. He
led the coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist
President Salvador Allende in September 1973.
   No date has been set for the plebiscite, but government
officials have said it will be in the second half of this year.
   In his 35-minute speech, Pinochet made no reference to his
candidacy but said the next president ``must identify himself''
with the constitution imposed by the military.
   If the government granted the opposition demand to amend the
constitution and block the government's election plan, ``a
situation of public unrest and serious uncertanties would follow,''
he said.
   According to the constitution, if voters reject the military
candidate in the plebiscite this year, an open presidential
election must be called in 1990 with Pinochet remaining in power
until then.
   Several thousand people gathered in front of a government
building in downtown Santiago as Pinochet, in a general's uniform,
arrived to make his speech. Some said they were government
employees and had been ordered to go there.
   Police said there were scattered scuffles in Santiago between
government supporters and dissidents after Pinochet's speech.

   The usually tame Soviet media provided sensational
coverage Friday of the hijacking of an Aeroflot jetliner by a
family of jazz musicians, digging up details about the private
lives of the air pirates.
   ``Interrupted Flight,'' read the headline of Sovietskaya
Rossiya. ``Combat Aboard a Plane,'' screamed the labor newspaper
Trud.
   ``The Simeons Throw off Their Mask'' proclaimed Pravda, the
official voice of the Communist Party, referring to the name of the
jazz ensemble.
   Nine people died in the attack, including five of the 11
hijackers.
   The reports included dirt on the musical family from Siberia and
described in detail how they were duped into thinking they had
landed in Finland.
   Even under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for
glasnost, or openness, the reports offered a rare account of an act
of terrorism in the Soviet Union.
   The hijackers were all members of the Ovechkin family, a
Siberian jazz ensemble from Irkutsk that went by the name ``Seven
Simeons.''
   Armed with a bomb and shotguns, they boarded the Leningrad-bound
Tupolev-154 in Irkutsk, and after a refueling stop in Kurgan
demanded that they be taken to London, the newspapers said.
   But the pilot set the plane down on a small airfield near
Leningrad. Five of the hijackers, including the ``hero-mother,''
described as the ringleader, three passengers and a stewardess were
killed in an ensuing shootout.
   The newspapers covering the story didn't rely on dispatches from
the official news agency Tass; they assigned their own
correspondents.
   Trud said the group, which was named after a Russian fairy tale
about a large family of farmers, was a hit in Irkutsk and was
gaining popularity nationwide.
   The ensemble visited Japan in November. Their pictures appeared
in the local press frequently and they were the subject of a
documentary film.
   The group had been scheduled to play a concert March 4-6 in
Irkutsk, but canceled because one of the brothers was ill,
according to Trud. The real reason for the cancellation, the paper
suggested, was that they were preparing to flee the country.
   ``At that time they were selling all their household goods,''
Trud reported.
   Pravda said the trip to Japan swelled their heads.
   ``The boundless praise apparently made their heads spin; the
Ovechkins began to dream about the `good life' abroad,'' it said,
without citing a source.
   It said the family members had everything going for them. They
had jobs and profited nicely from a private farm plot. But Pravda
said there was a dark side.
   The mother, Ninel Ovechkin, continued to deal in vodka, even
after her husband died a few years ago from excessive drinking.
   The media reports indicated that Mrs. Ovechkin, described as a
plump, well-dressed woman of over 50, had at least 11 children.
   Before setting out for the Irkutsk airport, the Ovechkins left a
note on their apartment door saying they were going to another
Siberian city and would return Friday, according to Pravda.
   All members of the family but the eldest sister boarded the
flight, Trud said.
   They carried only hand baggage, mainly musical instruments,
according to Pravda. Everything was searched except for the string
bass, which wouldn't fit in the X-ray machine, Pravda said. The
Ovechkins refused to allow the bass to be checked into the baggage
compartment, and nothing suspicious was found in a visual
inspection, Pravda said.
   Tass said Thursday the weapons used in the hijacking had been
smuggled aboard the plane in the instruments.
   
   The newspapers portrayed stewardess Tamara Zharkaya as a martyr
who negotiated calmly with the hijackers, who were armed with
16-gauge, sawed-off shotguns.
   
   ``This girl took a tremendous responsibility upon herself,''
Pravda said. ``She succeeded in psychological victory over the
bandits.''
   Sovietskaya Rossiya quoted Pilot First Class Valentin Kupriyanov
as saying the crew decided to accept the demand because the
hijackers were becoming dangerous.
   ``To avoid placing the passengers at risk, we decided to fulfill
the demands of the bandits and fly abroad,'' Kupriyanov recalled.
``The ground (flight controllers) approved our action. But the
closer we got to Leningrad, the clearer it became that we would not
reach even nearby Finnish or Swedish airports.''
   Izvestia said the flight crew contacted the ground, and a plan
was worked out to dupe the hijackers into thinking they were
landing in Finland.
   An assault team was waiting when the Tu-154 touched down, media
said.
   The attack was over in minutes.

   President Reagan imposed new sanctions Friday
against Panama, trying to weaken military strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega's grip on power and end ``the illegitimate Noriega regime.''
   In a written statement, Reagan said, ``I believe that General
Noriega would best serve his country by complying with the
instruction of President (Eric Arturo) Delvalle to relinquish his
post.''
   Delvalle, the civilian figurehead president regarded as the
legitimate constitutional authority by the United States, has been
in hiding since Feb. 26 when he tried unsuccessfully to fire
Noriega as commander of the Panama Defense Forces. Noriega is under
indictment in the United States on drug-smuggling and racketeering
charges.
   Reagan ordered that U.S. government payments due Panama be put
in escrow until constitutional rule is restored in Panama. A $6.6
million payment is due next Tuesday for operations relating to the
Panama Canal.
   He also suspended trade preferences Panama receives under a
special system for Third World countries and the Caribbean Basin
Initiative. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said $96 million
worth of goods would be affected annually.
   In addition, Reagan ordered stepped up scrutiny of Panama by
U.S. Immigration and Customs Service officials ``to apprehend drug
traffickers and money launderers.''
   Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa told a news conference he was
pleased with Reagan's announcement. He said that by themselves
sanctions will not be enough to bring down Noriega but that this
goal will be achieved when combined with the actions of the
Panamanian people.
   Based on information he refused to disclose, Sosa said he was
``very optimistic'' that Noriega intends to depart Panama shortly.
   ABC News quoted diplomatic sources as saying the government of
Spain was prepared to offer asylum to Noriega.
   The two countries most mentioned by opposition leaders as
possible asylum sites are Paraguay and the Dominican Republic.
Opposition leaders say they have sounded out the Dominican Republic
and that Noriega sent two military colleagues to Paraguay this past
week, possibly to discuss asylum prospects.
   The administration is trying to force Noriega's ouster and
weaken the military-dominated government by increasing the
cash-squeeze in Panama. Measures already taken with U.S. support
have caused a severe cash shortage, prompting the government to
suspend many banking operations, crippling Panama's economy.
   U.S. military and economic aid to Panama was cut off last year
following the initial popular uprisings against Noriega in June.
Last week, the United States ruled that Panama was not cooperating
in efforts to control drug trafficking.
   Under the finding, the United States was required to stop
military and economic assistance _ which already had been done _
and to oppose Panamanian requests for assistance in international
lending institutions.
   Reagan said Noriega's resignation ``would contribute very
substantially to reducing political tensions and set the stage for
a prompt transition to democracy in Panama.
   ``Until such a time as democratic government is restored in
Panama, the U.S. cannot proceed on a business-as-usual basis,'' the
president said. ``Today, therefore, I have taken a number of steps
against the illegitimate Noriega regime that will contribute
significantly to the goal of a democratic, stable and prosperous
Panama.''
   Underscoring Reagan's use of the word ``illegitimate,'' Shultz
told a news conference, ``that's a very strong word.
   ``What we think should happen is that he should leave Panama,
and we want to see a return to civilian democratic rule, and we
also expect to see the Panamanian Defense Forces resume an
honorable and proper role'' in a constitutional government.
   He said Noriega ``has to get out of the way.''
   Shultz said there was no need to impose an additional sanction
to cut off fees Panama receives from Alaskan oil shipments which
are transferred to U.S. East Coast ports through a Panamanian
pipeline. He said that money already has been frozen under a
temporary restraining order from a U.S. court. A source speaking
only on condition of an/nymity said later that the order was issued
by a court in Massachussetts and ran until Friday.
   The First National Bank of Boston agreed to freeze activity on
Panamanian government accounts until the State Department lifts
sanctions against the nation, according to a settlement filed in
U.S. District Court there. The action stemmed from a civil suit
filed earlier this week by Sosa.
   A federal judge Tuesday issued a temporary injunction against
payments to any Panamanian government agency from accounts at Bank
of Boston and four Florida-based banks. In addition, a restraining
order was issued Friday by a federal judge in New York against the
Bank of Boston International, which holds a Panama government
clearing account.
   Shultz accused Noriega of trying to impose a military coup in
Panama by deposing Delvalle.
   Shultz said the U.S. actions will escalate Panama's cash
shortage. ``That does have some effect on the economy but it also
has an effect ... on the immediate ability to manage things.''
   He said the United States did not impose a broad trade embargo
against Panama because ``we don't want to punish the Panamanian
people.'' Instead, he said, ``We're anxious to see General Noriega
get out of there.''
   Shultz added, ``We're trying to very carefully and deliberately
but strongly take actions that are focused in on things that we
think will make a difference.''

<HEAD>Three In $1.3 Billion Tax Scheme Sentenced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men convicted in a scheme to create more
than $350 million in bogus tax deductions for celebrities such as
Andy Warhol, Lorne Green and Sidney Poitier drew sentences Friday
ranging from probation to two years in prison.
   IRS officials believe the scheme was the largest tax-fraud case
in U.S. history, said Assitant U.S. Attorney Stuart Abrams said
late last year.
   The three promoters of the scheme were indicted in 1987 on
charges of creating more than $1.3 billion in fraudulent losses and
interest expenses while trading in Treasury bill futures and other
government securities.
   Those losses generated bogus tax deductions for investors such
as actor Michael Landon, former Postmaster General Preston R.
Tisch, Tisch's brother, CBS president Laurence A. Tisch, the late
Lorne Greene and TV producer Norman Lear.
   The investors are not accused of wrongdoing but will have to
square accounts with the IRS. They had expected to receive $4 in
tax deductions for every $1 invested.
   Charles Agee Atkins, 33, of Amelia Island Plantation, Fla., was
sentenced by U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker to two years in
prison, four years' probation and 500 hours a year of community
service.
   Atkins is the son of former Ashland Oil Co. chairman Orin E.
Atkins
   William Hack, 62, of New York City was sentenced to four months
in prison, four years, eight months' probation, and 1,000 hours a
year in community service. He was fined $25,000.
   Ernest Grunebaum, 52, of Chappaqua, N.Y., was placed on
probation for five years and ordered to do 400 hours of community
service a year.
   The three were convicted in December of conspiring to defraud
the Internal Revenue Service; they could have received five years
in prison on that count alone. Atkins and Hack were also convicted
of numerous tax offenses.

<HEAD>Tass Says Soviets Debating Whether to Retain Death Penalty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens are engaged in ``heated
discussions'' about whether a new criminal code now being written
should retain capital punishment, Tass said Friday.
   In a report from Riga, capital of Latvia, the official Soviet
news agency said a final decision will be made after nationwide
discussion. Defendants sentenced to death in the Soviet Union are
executed by firing squads.
   ``Heated discussions are going on over the problem of capital
punishment,'' Tass said. ``Some people insist that it should be
repealed altogether, while others insist that it should be
preserved for some special cases. The latter view predominates at
the moment.''
   The state-run media occasionally report executions of people
convicted of such crimes as treason, murder and wide-scale bribery
and corruption. The reports have not indicated how frequently the
death penalty is imposed.
   In an interview with Igor Karpets, a Latvian law professor, Tass
said the revised code will contain a new section covering
punishments for ``crimes against peace and humanity.''
   What behavior that section is intended to discourage was not
clear, but one possibility is terrorism.
   Soviet officials have referred frequently to the review of the
28-year-old criminal code, but have not said when the draft will be
completed.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-one children forced to take
refuge at two farms when a late-season blizzard waylaid their two
school buses settled in for a second night of campstove meals and
makeshift bedding Friday.
   One of the farms had no electricity.
   ``The storm hit a little faster than we thought,'' said bus
driver Sharon Grubbs, who had eight children with her when the
storm bore down Thursday afternoon, with heavy snow and winds up to
55 mph reducing visibility to zero.
   She said she and fellow driver Linda Barrett, who had 13
children on her bus, were in radio contact when they decided to
find shelter rather than continue taking children home from the
Banner County school in Harrisburg.
   Ms. Grubbs' crew landed at Jack and Karen Holt's farm about 17
miles west of Harrisburg. Holt was snowed in elsewhere.
   The storm knocked out electricity at the farm late Thursday and
things were still chilly Friday afternoon as the wind buffeted the
farmhouse, said Ms. Grubbs.
   Ms. Grubbs and Mrs. Holt used a camping stove to cook meals as
children huddled in their coats and under blankets. ``We're kind of
hurting,'' said Ms. Grubbs. ``We've tried to fix one hot thing for
every meal.''
   The three boys and five girls, ages 7 to 13, have been playing
games and listening to a battery-operated radio. They telephoned
their parents to let them know they were safe, said Ms. Grubbs, a
10-year veteran bus driver.
   ``They've been super for us,'' she said. ``They've cooperated so
well, but they ride the bus together every day.''
   Mrs. Barrett and her 13 passengers found refuge at Agnes Wynne's
farm, about 20 miles from Harrisburg.
   Mrs. Wynne, who lives alone, said she was worried the food won't
last. ``We've managed so far,'' she said. ``I guess we just take
each day as it comes.''
   Menus so far have included chili and homemade noodles, Mrs.
Barrett said. Children were sleeping wall-to-wall in the
two-bedroom farmhouse, said Mrs. Wynne.
   The children have been playing games and even doing homework,
since many had their school and library books, Mrs. Barrett said.
   ``The kids have been really good,'' she said. ``We have one
kindergartner and I don't think he's ever been away from home
before.''
   Mrs. Barrett said the youngest spoke with his parents on the
phone and seemed to be coping well.

<HEAD>Gorbachev to Sign New Declaration with Yugoslavia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev is to visit
Belgrade next week and sign a new guarantee of Yugoslavia's
independence, which the late President Tito declared forcefully in
1948 by breaking with the Soviet Union.
   Senior Yugoslav officials said Friday the declaration also
appears to indicate the future course of Soviet relations with
other nations.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to arrive Monday and stay four days on
the first official visit to this nonaligned communist country by a
Soviet leader since 1976.
   The new document will update previous declarations of 1955 and
1956 and ``further confirm principles of non-interference on the
basis of equality and sovereignty,'' Ilija Djukic, the deputy
foreign minister, told reporters.
   The late Leonid I. Brezhnev was the last Kremlin leader to pay
an official visit to Yugoslavia, which broke with the Soviet bloc
over ideological issues in 1948 but maintained economic and
political links.
   Brezhnev attended Tito's funeral in May 1980. Tito had visited
Moscow in 1979.
   The declaration calls for ``non-interference of any kind in the
internal matters of the two countries,'' a senior official said on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the document also appears to represent a message about a
general change in Soviet policy under Gorbachev.
   The declaration, to be made public during the visit, is said to
call for cooperation with all nations and parties ``regardless of
ideological differences'' and ``full and principled implementation
of human rights in the whole world,'' the official said.

   A truck driver barged into his
estranged wife's home and blasted away inside with a shotgun
Friday, then jackknifed his rig on a busy freeway and held officers
at bay for five hours, police said.
   Ronald Stone, 34, put down his double-barreled shotgun and
surrendered at 7:20 a.m. after threatening to shoot anyone who
approached, police said. No serious injuries were reported.
   Stone, who had engaged police in an armed standoff a decade ago,
was taken to the Solano County Jail and booked for investigation of
attempted murder, said Police Chief Gary Tatum.
   The standoff closed Interstate 80, the east-west artery between
San Francisco and Sacramento, forcing miles of backed-up traffic
onto bypass routes.
   Stone's brother, Jim, 38, of Grass Valley, said Stone went to
his wife's house, ``thinking everything was all right again. But
she said, `Get out of here.' That's when he wigged.''
   Stone's wife, Jackie, said: ``I thought I was going to die.''
   Tatum said Stone's wife had called police at 12:46 a.m. to
report that her husband, from whom she had been separated for about
a month, was at the door and appeared drunk. By the time officers
arrived, he was gone.
   Tatum said they received a second call about half an hour later
from one of Stone's children saying Stone had returned.
   Lt. Gary Mallory said Stone kicked his way into the house where
Mrs. Stone, their three young children, and Mrs. Stone's mother
were staying. According to Mallory, Stone told the children, ``It's
time for your mother and I to die.''
   Stone's mother-in-law and the children fled as Stone went
upstairs, found Mrs. Stone, who had been hiding, and attacked her,
Mallory said.
   She escaped, but Stone fired four blasts from a 12-gauge shotgun
inside the house, then two more from the porch after she ran
outside, said Mallory.
   When police arrived, Stone threatened to kill himself, Mallory
said. Then he leaped into his tractor-trailer and drove for an hour
at speeds of up to 90 mph, with police pursuing.
   On the freeway, he jackknifed the empty truck, apparently on
purpose, Mallory said. Police closed the freeway in both
directions. Stone sat in the vehicle with ``lots of ammunition,''
said Mallory.
   Police talked with Stone, first by CB radio and then via a
military-style field telephone tossed into the cab. ``He was
distraught and felt as though his marriage was on the rocks. He no
longer wanted to live,'' said Tatum.
   Stone gave up after five hours, firing a final blast out the
truck window. He suffered minor powder burns but was otherwise
unhurt.
   In 1978 in Vacaville, Stone held off police with a gun in a
domestic dispute, Tatum said. No shots were fired and no one was
injured, according to police, who had no further details. Relatives
said he spent some time in jail as a result.

   Nine Mile Point 2 went into permanent
commercial operation Friday after 11 years of delays and cost
overruns that have made it the nation's most expensive nuclear
plant at a cost of $6.3 billion.
   The 1,080-megawatt plant, which was to have been completed in
1977 for $423 million, went on line at 3 p.m., providing
electricity to more than 9 million New Yorkers, said Niagara Mohawk
Power Corp. spokesman William Romano.
   It becomes the 105th nuclear plant operating commercially in the
United States.
   ``I feel great,'' said Niagara Mohawk President William Donlon.
``It's been a difficult period, it's been difficult on the company.
But we did succeed. We did not fail where others have.''
   Nine Mile 2, on the Lake Ontario shoreline north of Oswego, will
generate enough electricity to replace about 6 million to 8 million
barrels of oil per year, said Romano.
   Besides Niagara Mohawk, four other utilities own the
boiling-water reactor _ New York State Electric and Gas, Long
Island Lighting Co., Rochester Gas & Electric Corp., and Central
Hudson Gas & Electric Corp.
   Nine Mile 2, which already has produced 250 million kilowatt
hours of commercial electricity during testing, will be brought up
to 100 percent operating capacity over the next several days,
Romano said.
   Niagara Mohawk was granted its construction permit for Nine Mile
2 in 1974, and began construction a year later. Work was not
completed until June 1986.
   Niagara Mohawk has attributed the cost overruns and delays on
upgraded safety standards and plant design changes required by the
NRC. Critics have blamed mismanagement, inefficient procurement
practices and union corruption.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rule Revenue Sharing Funds Don't Have To Be Released</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the
Reagan administration's refusal to release $180 million in revenue
sharing funds that had been withheld two years ago under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit, reverses a lower court which
had ordered Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III to release the
money.
   An attorney for three associations representing local
governments said an appeal of the latest decision was ``virtually
certain.''
   ``My sense is the court did not fully comprehend the nature of
our legal arguments. ... I think it's virtually certain we'll ask
the court to reconsider its decision,'' said David C. Vladek, a
lawyer for the National Association of Counties, the National
League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and 10 city and
county governments.
   The dispute involves President Reagan's Feb. 1, 1986 order under
the Gramm-Rudman law that set aside 4.3 percent of budget items,
including $180 million from that year's $4.2 billion appropriation
to the revenue sharing trust fund.
   The local governments argued that the law provided that
sequestered 1986 budget money should remain in government trust
funds and be paid out in 1987. They argued that even though
Congress had abolished revenue sharing after 1986, it intended that
any money remaining in the trust fund be distributed.
   Revenue sharing, begun under the Nixon administration, provided
nearly all local governments with unrestricted federal grants.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green, in a ruling last July 28,
found in favor of the local governments, and said Baker had
illegally transferred the revenue sharing money from the trust fund
to the general fund.
   However, Judge John R. Gibson, who wrote the appeals panel's
decision reversing Judge Green, said Congress' intent with the
Gramm-Rudman law was clearly to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   ``Merely freezing (the monies in 1986) and resuscitating them
(in 1987) would not result in any meaningful deficit reduction and
could be characterized by critics to be a sham,'' said Gibson, who
was joined by Judges Patricia M. Wald and David Santelle.
   ``The result in this case may be harsh, but we believe it is
consistent with congressional intent,'' wrote Gibson, who was
designated to the case from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit in St. Louis.
   Among the plaintiffs are New York City, Kansas City, Mo.;
Milwaukee County, Wis., and Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes
Cleveland.
   The U.S. Conference of Mayors, at the time of the original
district court decision last summer, had estimated that New York
would receive $10 million; Chicago, $2.6 million; Los Angeles, $2.2
million, and Detroit $1.3 million of the money.
   Other estimates were $606,000 for New Orleans, $554,000 for
Indianapolis, $677,000 for Washington, D.C., $440,000 for Denver
and $104,000 for Des Moines. Estimates for other cities were not
provided.

   A British Air Force transport that
made an emergency landing en route to the Falkland Islands left
Thursday after Britain agreed it would return to Ascension Island,
Uruguayan officials said.
   The Hercules C-130, carrying a crew of seven and a cargo of
tires, cylinders of oxygen and munitions, left Carrasco
International Airport outside Montevideo at nearly two days after
landing here, airport authorities said.
   The plane developed an oil leak while flying from its base on
Ascension to Mount Stanley in the Falklands, British Ambassador
Eric Vines said.
   Officials said the return to Ascension was a condition set by
Uruguaya's foreign minister, Luis Barrios Tassano, the former
ambassador to Argentina.
   Argentine authorities claimed the landing was no accident but
part of the controversial military manuevers that Britain began
Monday in the Falklands.
   Argentina and Britain fought in 1982 over sovereignty of the
remote South Atlantic islands. The 74-day war, won by Britain,
killed 712 Argentines and 256 Britons.
   Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo said the emergency
landing was actually a test to find out how Uruguay would react in
case of actual need during a similar wartime situation.
   Vines denied it.

   A Kenyan millionaire developer and arms
dealer was acquitted Thursday of conspiring with five other
Africans, including a nephew of Kenya's first president, to import
1,900 tons of marijuana into the United States.
   Stephen Mwangi, 49, was found innocent by a federal jury in its
fifth day of deliberations. Mwangi testified that he had come to
this country with one of the accused men to speak to potential
investors in a land deal.
   He was arrested in October with a Ugandan and four other
Kenyans, including Samuel Muigai, 36, a former Kenyan army officer.
Muigai's uncle was Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first president.
   Muigai and the four others have pleaded guilty and face terms of
up to 20 years in prison at sentencing later this month.
   All six were arrested after being driven by a Customs agent
posing as a drug buyer to the port in Gloucester City, where $1
million worth of marijuana was seized.
   The deal was arranged in long-distance calls between an
informant and defendants other than Mwangi. The calls were taped,
along with a conversation in the car when the agent was driving the
men from Philadelphia to New Jersey.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Patton alleged that Mwangi was a
silent backer of the deal, which was ultimately to involve three
tons of marijuana.

   A former aide to Gov. Evan Mecham said
Friday he looked into an alleged death threat and assured the
governor it was a ``little spat'' between employees that would
``probably go away by itself.''
   Max Hawkins, former Department of Administration chief, took the
stand for the defense at Mecham's Senate trial, where the governor
is accused among other things of trying to thwart an investigation
of the alleged threat against a witness testifying before a grand
jury investigating Mecham's finances.
   Hawkins said he confronted his employee, prison construction
chief Lee Watkins, who was accused of making the threat against
Donna Carlson, and got a different version of the story first
reported by Mecham aide Peggy Griffith.
   Mrs. Griffith has testified that Watkins warned that her friend
Carlson should stop talking or she might ``go on a long boat ride.''
   But Hawkins said Watkins told him: ``I told Peggy she should
tell Donna she should keep her mouth shut and stop running down the
governor in the press.' He said, `There are a lot of people out
there who are excitable and some harm may come to her.'''
   Hawkins said that Mrs. Griffith told a smiliar story and that he
did not think this constituted a threat.
   Asked what he told the governor, Hawkins said: ``It was a matter
that would probably go away by itself. That it was a little spat, a
frivolous matter, probably Lee blowing off steam and Peggy reacting
to it and to leave it alone and it would go away.''
   Hawkins was fired by acting Gov. Rose Mofford, who took office
after the 63-year-old Mecham was impeached by the House on Feb. 5.
   Mecham, who took office in January 1987, is the first U.S.
governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades.
   Besides being accused of ordering an aide not to cooperate with
the state attorney general's investigation of the alleged threat,
Mecham was charged by the House with concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan and loaning $80,000 in state money to his auto dealership.
   In earlier testimony Friday, one of Mecham's closest aides said
the governor believed he was ``divinely guided'' in making
executive decisions.
   Sam Steiger, a special assistant who was forced out of office by
his own indictment on political extortion charges, also described a
bitter battle between Mecham and the state's attorney general, whom
Steiger blamed for Mecham's downfall.
   ``I had the feeling that the governor did and does feel he is
divinely guided,'' Steiger said in response to a question by Sen.
John Mawhinney, a Republican like Mecham.
   Mawhinney asked if there was truth to rumors that Mecham, a
devout Mormon, ``could and would make decisions on specific pieces
of legislation through, he believed, some divine inspiration.''
   ``Yes, the governor believes his motives are divinely
inspired,'' said Steiger, ``at least adhering to principles that
are divinely inspired.'
   Mormon doctrine holds that faithful Christians may receive
guidance from God regarding wordly endeavors, including their
occupations. Church leaders also teach that God inspired the
political principles in the U.S. Constitution, and that it is God's
will that government adhere to them.
   Asked by The Associated Press about Steiger's comment on divine
guidance, Mecham would say only: ``Sam, he's a little off the wall
in some of his comments, too.''
   Although Steiger's defense testimony only peripherally addressed
the charge, he held senators riveted with his blunt, colorful
descriptions of the Mecham administration.
   Steiger blamed the governor's troubles at least partially on his
fierce battle with fellow Republican Attorney General Robert Corbin.
   That fight, he said, stemmed from Mecham's resentment that he
``took an inordinate public beating'' over eliminating the state's
Martin Luther King holiday for executive branch workers when it was
really the attorney general's idea.
   Corbin had advised all 1986 gubernatorial candidates that the
holiday had been illegally declared that year by then-Gov. Bruce
Babbitt and that Corbin would have to sue the governor if it was
observed.
   In the most vitriolic comments of the trial's two weeks, Steiger
described Corbin as ``not very bright but politically adept'' and
suggested he manipulated legislators.
   ``He (Corbin) has deluded many of you into thinking he is a
competent person,'' he told the senators.
   He declared that Corbin had turned the attorney general's office
into ``one of the most expensive in the country'' and disliked
Mecham's cost-cutting policies.
   ``I believe those people are capable of setting up anybody,'' he
said of Corbin and his staff, ``but I have no knowledge they did.''
   Contacted for comment on Steiger's remarks, Corbin said: ``Oh
well, you know Sam. Just remember the position he is in with regard
to our office and you can draw your own conclusions.''
   Steiger is being prosecuted by Corbin's office on charges that
he tried to extort a vote from a parole board member.
   Mecham faces a criminal charge brought by Corbin's office
alleging that he concealed the $350,000 campaign loan.
   He also faces a recall election May 22, but that could change if
he is convicted by the Senate. A two-thirds vote of senators could
remove him from office, and a second two-thirds vote could bar him
from holding any state office again.

   Panicked soccer fans fled knife-wielding
ruffians and triggered the collapse of a sports stadium in Libya,
killing at least 20 people, according to news reports Friday.
   Malta's state radio said two Libyans were arrested in Tripoli,
the Libyan capital, after the collapse.
   Newspapers in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, quoting a report from the
Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug from Tripoli, said at least 20
people were killed and hundreds injured when a stadium dividing
wall fell Thursday during a match between Malta and Libya.
   But the Libyan news agency JANA said two spectators were killed.
The JANA report, monitored in London, said some people had been
treated and released and 16 were hospitalized.
   Joe Sacco, the general secretary of the Maltese Football
Association who was in Tripoli with the Maltese team, said Friday
there was speculation in the Libyan capital that the death toll
could be higher.
   JANA said a row of seats collapsed at the ``June 11'' Stadium.
The stadium reportedly has a capacity of 70,000. It was not
immediately known how many people were at the game.
   The Times of Malta said panic occurred when someone in the
stands brandished a weapon and the spectators rushed to get out.
   Politika Ekspres, a Belgrade daily, said the incident began when
several fans pulled out knives during a quarrel.
   Some spectators returning to Malta told reporters at the airport
the same story while others quoted people in the stadium as saying
a man was terrorizing the crowd with a snake.
   Politika Ekspres said spectators seeking safety toppled an iron
fence. At the same time, a six-foot thick, 15-foot long wall
dividing the second from the third level of the stadium also
crashed down.
   ``It is hard to believe that anyone under it could have remained
alive,'' Politika Ekspres said, quoting eyewitnesses.
   Several hundred people reportedly were injured when the crowd
from the third level surged down, creating panic that soon spread
to other parts of the stadium.
   People rushed to exits, and that caused more injuries, the paper
said.
   Finally, about 5,000 fans in the field started chasing the
culprits. One of them was captured but police managed to drag him
free from the hands of the crowd, Politika Ekspres said.
   Malta's Department of Information said the Foreign Ministry was
informed that no Maltese nationals were involved in the accident.
   The Libyans were leading 1-0 in the exhibition game between the
two national teams. The game was stopped and did not resume.
   Prime Minister Edward Fench Adami of Malta sent a message Friday
to Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, extending ``our
condolences and deepest sympathies to the familes of the bereaved
and to all those hit by this tragedy.''
   ``The people of Malta join me in sharing your profound grief at
this unhappy moment during the sports festival,'' Fenech Adami said
in the message.

<TEXT>
   Panama's military-backed government
ordered cuts in public services Friday as new U.S. sanctions
compounded a financial crisis. Police firing tear gas broke up an
opposition rally.
   The beleaguered government of strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega reportedly also was considering delaying or reducing
paychecks due early next week to nearly 150,000 public employees. A
spokesman said no decision was made on those steps.
   Several businessmen said they were warned their stores could be
expropriated if they refused to cash public employees' paychecks.
   A planned demonstration by government opponents in the central
banking district was broken up Friday afternoon by riot police
firing tear gas grenades and spraying the stinging, acrid liquid
from portable canisters.
   Large numbers of police prevented any sustained gathering of
demonstrators. Small groups gathered and then ran, setting a few
fires. An Associated Press photographer at the scene reported more
journalists on hand than police, spectators and demonstrators.
   At one site there were about 60 journalists and fewer than 20
protesters, who loudly chanted ``Justice!'' and taunted the police.
   Three journalists were injured when police sprayed gas in their
faces at close range. They were: Lucia Annunziata, a reporter with
La Repubblica of Rome; David Walters, a photographer with the Miami
Herald; and Manolo Iscala, a cameraman for Spanish television.
   The nation's new chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma, ordered
his Cabinet into emergency session after President Reagan imposed
several new sanctions, including putting some Panama Canal fees in
escrow.
   A spokesman for Solis Palma characterized Reagan's action as ``a
state of war.''
   The Cabinet ordered working hours in all government offices
slashed from eight to six hours daily.
   It also told government agencies and departments to cut their
use of electricity, fuel and telephones, and asked employees to
take vacations due them immediately.
   Treasury Minister Hector Alexander was quoted by a Panama City
newspaper as saying upcoming paydays of public employees ``are
going to have to be deferred'' because of a growing cash shortage.
   The newspaper La Estrella said the treasury minister did not
elaborate on his remark about delaying paychecks, which was carried
in a brief, three-paragraph story Friday morning.
   A source close to Panama's government said the Cabinet also
contemplated delaying paychecks to government workers, reducing
their pay temporarily and giving them partial payment in food
instead of cash.
   The U.S. sanctions were announced on the 10th day of a bank
closure forced by a cash shortage in Panama. The country uses the
American dollar as its currency and its Central Bank normally
receives transfers from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   The United States halted those transfers last week and attorneys
for ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle have tied up an estimated
$50 million in official Panamanian funds in private U.S. banks.
   Directors of six supermarket and one pharmacy chains said Mario
Rognoni, the trade and industries minister, told them the
government could expropriate the chains if they did not cash public
employees' paychecks.
   They said in a statement they would consider a general strike if
the government followed through on its ``veiled threat.''
   If they cashed the checks, they would have no money to operate
``in less than 24 hours,'' the directors said.
   Rognoni denied he made any threat and said he only wanted to
advance the idea of having chains give food to employees and deduct
the value from the paychecks.
   Panama's most recent problems began in February when Noriega was
indicted in Florida on U.S. drug-trafficking and money laundering
chages.
   On Feb. 25, President Delvalle tried to remove Noriega as chief
of the Defense Forces. Instead, Noriega arranged for the
legislature to dismiss Delvalle, and a political and economic
crisis ensued.
   Washington responded by imposing economic sanctions on Panama
and declaring its support for Delvalle, who went into hiding.
   On Friday, Reagan stepped up U.S. economic pressure by ordering
that a $6.5 million canal payment due Tuesday be put into escrow.
   Reagan ordered several other measures and called on Noriega to
resign.
   In Boston, the First National Bank of Boston agreed to freeze
Panamanian government accounts until the State Department lifts
sanctions against the nation, according to a settlement filed in
U.S. District Court.
   The Panamanian government normally disburses about $33 million
in paychecks every two weeks, but its cash reserves are said by
diplomatic sources and private economists to be approaching zero.
   The government managed to pay its 15,000 soldiers Thursday, but
must meet a bi-monthly payroll for the nation's 20,000 public
school teachers on Monday and thousands of other government workers
on Tuesday.
   The school teachers form a powerful lobby that brought down a
civilian president in 1979 over a pay dispute.
   Public employees in general are considered to be among the few
remaining backers of Noriega.

   A blizzard plastered the northern Plains with deep snow driven
by wind up to 65 mph Friday, endangering newborn calves and
stranding travelers along hundreds of miles of blocked highways in
Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming and the Dakotas.
   The storm barreled into Minnesota on Friday night. Blizzard
warnings were issued for the northwestern part of the state, and
wet snow and 35 mph wind made driving hazardous.
   Students heading home aboard two school buses were caught by the
storm Thursday and were spending their second night as guests at
two farms, one of which had no electricity.
   ``We feel it is in the best interest of the public to not, not
go out on the highway,'' said Capt. Pius Ternes of the North Dakota
Highway Patrol. ``We don't want someone getting stranded. It's just
a very dangerous situation.''
   ``We've mostly had people sliding off the road. We're not even
pulling them out. We're just getting people out of the vehicles,''
Nebraska State Patrol dispatcher Alex Haberkorn said in Scottsbluff.
   Several hundred pupils in Colorado spent the night in their
schools. Some travelers tried to sleep on the floors of a
courthouse. North Dakota Capitol workers were sent home Friday
about an hour after they arrived.
   There were numerous minor accidents as vehicles slid on ice and
snow, and many schools closed. Snow plows could not keep up with
blowing, drifting snow in many areas. Wyoming state offices were
closed, although the Legislature met.
   Hard-hit Nebraska was not expected to get relief until late
Friday or early Saturday. The storm was expected to track across
Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   Up to 40 inches of snow fell in two days in the mountains of
Utah at the Alta ski resort, with 37 inches at Snowbird. Three to 4
feet had fallen around Lead and Deadwood, on the edges of South
Dakota's Black Hills. Visibility in areas was down to zero.
   School bus driver Linda Barret and her 13 riders took refuge
Thursday at a farm some 20 miles from Harrisburg, Neb., when the
storm cut visibility, and bus driver Sharon Grubbs and her eight
riders, ages 7 to 13, wound up at a farm 17 miles from Harrisburg,
in far western Nebraska.
   They were still there Friday and planned to spend a second
night. The electricity had been out at the second farm, owned by
Jack and Karen Holt, since late Thursday.
   ``It's kind of like the old days,'' Ms. Grubbs said. She and
Mrs. Holt used a camping stove to cook meals while the children
huddled under blankets.
   Outside Scottsbluff, Neb., Jim and Elizabeth Davis of Hot
Springs, Wyo., spent about 15 hours stuck in their car before they
were rescued Friday. Davis, 68, said he and his 67-year-old wife
had apples and candy, plenty of blankets and a full gas tank.
   For one resort, the storm was too much of a good thing.
   ``We must have close to 4 foot. Even the ski slopes are
closed,'' said Bob Ekeren, manager of the Terry Peak Lodge in the
Black Hills. Snow buried cars at the lodge and would-be skiers
stayed inside Friday morning, he said.
   ``Right now you can't hardly see your hand in front of your
face,'' Ekeren said. ``I've never seen this much snow in my life.
It's just unbelievable.''
   Wind gusting to 60 mph was reported Friday morning at Fort
Morgan, Colo., and to 65 mph at Rapid City, S.D. Western Nebraska
had gusts to 50 mph.
   The wind blew off a 20-by-30 foot section of roof at a Rapid
City hotel, and it landed on three cars. No one was hurt. ``If
there would have been someone down there, it would have killed them
for sure,'' said manager Gregory Lester.
   Friday was the 100th anniversary of the start of the four-day
Great Blizzard of 1888 in the East. That storm claimed 400 lives.
   The weather threatened thousands of newborn calves, and ranchers
in the Nebraska Sandhills region worked around the clock to get
animals to shelter.
   ``The men are just exhausted. ... We worked all night long,''
said Marianne Beel. ``We had 300 calves born yesterday. We're
dragging them in, separating them from their mothers.''
   Dick Kjerstad, chairman of the South Dakota Beef Checkoff
Campaign Committee, said Friday the storm could be a severe blow to
the state's cattle industry. ``If it lasts another day, there could
sure be some big losses,'' he said.
   In the Nebraska Panhandle, all roads in and out of Kimball were
closed and Civil Defense Director Dan Jenson estimated 600
travelers spent the night in the town of 3,800 residents.
   Hotels and motels were filled, and residents opened their homes,
he said. But many spent the night at the Kimball County Courthouse,
and about 200 truckers slept in their trucks.
   ``I've never seen so many gosh-dang people,'' Jenson said.
   Interstate 80 was closed for more than 300 miles, from Walcott,
Wyo., to Rock Springs, Neb., because of snowdrifts and low
visibility. Many other roads also were closed in eastern Wyoming,
including almost 140 miles of Interstate 25, and in western
Nebraska.
   The closing of roads into Laramie, Wyo., marooned skiers at the
Snowy Range ski area, which has no overnight accommodations.
Co-owner Terri Collins said about 180 people spent the night on the
floor and tables and most were too tired Friday morning to go
skiing on 12 inches of fresh snow.
   ``We've got all the roads closed. People have to stay home,''
said Kathy Moan of the Wyoming Highway Patrol. She said roads in
and out of Cheyenne and Gillette were closed and the eastern part
of the state was immobilized Friday morning.
   About 100 miles of Interstate 90 was closed overnight in western
South Dakota, and sections of I-94 were closed in North Dakota.
Several northeastern Colorado highways also were closed, including
sections of Interstates 25 and 70, the State Patrol said.
   In northern Colorado, 250 to 300 of the 1,200 students in the
Weld County School District spent the night in schools because
buses couldn't get them home Thursday, said Superintendent Bob
Gudka.
   ``The kids are having a ball,'' Gudka said. As for the teachers,
he joked, ``we may have to get psychological help for them later
on.''
   He said parents in four-wheel-drive vehicles fetched some
students Friday morning and a few were sent home on a convoy of
buses accompanied by other four-wheel-drives.

   Dennis Day, a tenor who appeared on
Jack Benny's TV and radio shows and recorded ``Danny Boy'' and
other Irish ballads, was hospitalized in critical and unstable
condition, a hospital spokesman said Friday.
   The 71-year-old singer whose trademark line was a sprightly
``Gee, Mr. Benny!'' was brought to the emergency room Wednesday
after a fall at his home, said Armen Markarian, a spokesman at
St.John's Hospital and Health Center.
   While in the emergency room, Day complained of a severe
headache. A scan showed bleeding in the brain and he was rushed
into surgery, Markarian said. ``He's been in critical condition
since then,'' the hospital spokesman added.
   In July, Day's spokesman announced that he had been diagnosed
with amyotropic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative nerve disease
also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. However, Markarian said Day's
condition did not appear to be related.
   Day was born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York City. His singing
career began in 1939 as a naive kid with a golden voice on Jack
Benny's radio show.
   He recorded such songs as ``Peg of My Heart'' and ``Clancy
Lowered the Boom,'' and appeared in several films, including ``Buck
Benny Rides Again,'' ``Music in Manhattan,'' ``One Sunday
Afternoon'' and ``The Girl Next Door.''

   That could further erode support for the general, chief of the

   With help from a U.S.-led aid
program, a rundown site dividing Roman Catholic and Protestant
areas of Belfast is being transformed into an industrial park for
fledgling businessmen.
   It is one of about 40 projects that have been promised money
from the multimillion-dollar International Fund for Ireland, the
most tangible outgrowth of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 that
aims to help reconcile feuding Catholics and Protestants in
Northern Ireland.
   The $1.6 million-Townsend Enterprise Park will create space for
45 new businesses near the towering ``peace wall'' dividing the
Protestant Shankill Road district from the Catholic Falls Road.
   Frank Murphy, the project head, said it would not have gone
forward without the fund's $440,000 contribution.
   But just as the fund is getting off the ground, its future has
been put in question following an announcement that the U.S. State
Department is dropping the fund from its 1989 allocations. Of the
fund's present kitty of $86.8 million, $85 million has come from
Washington with $35 million more due this year.
   The rationale behind the fund is that in a province with a
17-percent unemployment rate and the collapse of its traditional
heavy industries, only economic revival can eliminate slums,
joblessness and resentment.
   Another project helped by the fund aims at turning the
first-century ruin of Navan Fort in County Armagh into a tourist
site. Another has given $4,500 to Frank O'Donnell, a 24-year-old
Londonderry Catholic unemployed for two years, to open his own
business selling hand-carved fireplace mantels.
   When the fund was set up in 1986, the U.S. Congress approved
$120 million over three years to stimulate economic regeneration
and foster Catholic-Protestant reconciliation. Seventy-five percent
was earmarked for Northern Ireland and 25 percent for border
counties in the Irish republic to the south.
   Some Protestants are suspicious, since the Anglo-Irish Agreement
grants the Irish republican government in Dublin a say in their
affairs. The Rev. Ian Paisley, the Northern Irish Protestant
hardliner, called the fund ``Yankee blood money'' and urged a
boycott of its projects.
   The European Economic Community, which had been expected to make
a major donation, has held back because London and Dublin can't
agree on a joint application for funds. Canada is contributing $10
million spread over 10 years, and New Zealand has given a one-time
$300,000 payment.
   Bob Myers, U.S. consul general in Belfast, said in an interview
the United States wants more countries to contribute to the fund.
   But concern rose in Ireland in February when U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State John Whitehead said the United States ``does not
receive a real return'' on its contribution to the fund and was
dropping it from the State Department's 1989 foreign aid
allocations.
   In its present state, the fund would die without the U.S.
donation, and Irish-American congressmen, such as Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., say they are confident Congress will continue to
support the International Fund.
   The fund's board has so far allocated only 20 percent of its
money, about $16 million, to some 40 projects. It says about 2,000
applications have come from both Catholics and Protestants, despite
Paisley's call for a boycott, and hopes to have distributed the
whole amount within 18 months.
   ``I would have liked to see quicker progress. ... But I'm
absolutely certain if we plunged in, spending money like drunken
sailors, it would have been disastrous,'' said Charles E.B. Brett,
the lawyer and former public official who chairs the fund's
seven-member board.
   The board gives priority to job-creation programs, tourism and
venture capital companies. One idea never tried before is the joint
marketing of Irish goods from both north and south.
   The board has also approved projects to help universities
develop marketable products and more than half a dozen programs to
launch entrepreneurs like O'Donnell in Londonderry.
   Danny Morrison, publicity director for Sinn Fein, the outlawed
Irish Republican Army's legal political wing, and the Rev. Matthew
Wallace, a Catholic priest on the Townsend Park board in Belfast,
complained that the fund was putting too little into Catholic areas
where unemployment is 2{ times higher than in Protestant areas.
   Wallace said he preferred to see American companies investing in
Northern Ireland and creating real jobs.
   ``That's more important than the money itself from the fund _
the money will do nothing,'' the priest said.
   ``I don't think we can expect violence to end unless we do
something about unemployment,'' said Franklin Adair, a banker who
heads the Youth Enterprise Scheme _ YES. The fund's first grant of
$88,500 went to YES, which is helping hundreds of people under 25
to start businesses.
   ``We must give young people something to hold on to,'' Adair
said. ``Otherwise, what do they have to lose? That's where I think
the American funds can be best used _ in positive creation of
employment. That's the way to achieve peace.''

   The government has rejected proposals for
cease-fire talks under the Central American peace plan and the
Guatemalan military has gone on the offensive against leftist rebel
strongholds in the countryside.
   President Vinicio Cerezo turned down guerrilla proposals for
talks as ``a good-for-nothing petition.'' A few days before he did
that, the Roman Catholic archbishop, Prospero Penados del Barrio,
accepted a request from the rebels to mediate between the two sides.
   The rebels, the church and most political parties have urged the
resumption of talks between the government and rebels in Madrid,
Spain, last October _ the first in the 27-year-old war.
   But Gen. Hector Gramajo, the defense minister, repeated the
military's insistence that the rebels abandon their weapons first.
   ``The army is very close to achieving a total victory,'' he said.
   A few days before the October talks began in Madrid with the
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, the umbrella for three
guerrilla forces, the army announced new operations in the
rebel-controlled northern part of Quiche province and on the
southern side of Lake Atitlan, where the rebels have been most
entrenched.
   Establishing a cease-fire is one of the commitments Guatemala
agreed to in signing the Central American peace plan last Aug. 7
along with Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras.
   Gramajo maintained, however, that with an amnesty that requires
rebels to disarm and participate in the political process, ``there
is no need for talks.''
   The rebels refute Gramajo's claims that they have only 500 to
700 now under arms, down from 2,500 to 3,000 in 1986, and that the
military offensive is a success. In the early 1980s, rebel strength
was estimated at 4,000 to 6,000 combatants.
   ``There is a flareup in the war in Guatemala, basically because
of the army offensive,'' said one of the guerrilla respresentatives
who went to Madrid in October, speaking on condition of anonymity.
He called the army's current offensive the ``biggest ever in
strictly military terms.''
   The army has thrown most of its strength of 43,000 personnel,
including air support, into the effort, mainly focused on Quiche.
   The guerrilla organization claims 3,500 combatants in its three
armies _ the Guerrilla Army of the Poor, the group fighting in
Quiche, a northwestern province; the Organization of the People in
Arms, generally in the Lake Atitlan area and west to San Marcos,
and the Rebel Armed Forces in the northern Peten panhandle province.
   Gramajo placed the army's casualties from September to
mid-February at 83, while the rebel source put them at 700 from
October through December. Neither side gave rebel casualties, which
generally are lower because guerrillas use ambushes and other
tactics that avoid direct combat.
   One of the army's main targets is what it considers the rebel
support population in northern Quiche _ thousands of campesinos,
most of them Indians, who have hidden from the army for as long as
seven years.
   They remained behind when thousands of others fled into
neighboring Mexico or cities in the early 1980s, when more than 400
villages were destroyed and tens of thousands of civilians killed
in the northwest highlands.
   Highlands residents, diplomats and human rights groups claim the
army did most of the killing. The army blames the guerrillas.
   The rebels say they are fighting for what they call real
democracy and national sovereignty and against social injustice and
poverty.,
   The most visible effect of the offensive in northern Quiche
around the area of Nebaj is the hundreds of refugees being brought
to the army base there. Gramajo says a sign of the army's success
is its ``rescue'' of 2,200 of the 4,000 peasants in the area.
   Although the army is allowing them to return to a few villages
near Nebaj where it has re-established permanent posts and is
putting in roads, the refugees must first receive three months of
army ``re-education'' in ``patriotism and nationalism,'' officers
said.
   Villagers farther north remain closed to them.
   ``Right now they can't return to those places,'' the civilian
affairs officer at the base said. ``The army is going to have more
success the fewer the people who are there.''
   One refugee identifying himself only as Diego said some refugees
are captured by the army and others turn themselves in when
soldiers appear.
   ``We saw, well, that there was no way out because the army was
covering all the points,'' he said in a whisper outside a
wood-plank army barracks at Nebaj.

<HEAD>Drought and Economic Problems Keep Mali Poor</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY LARRY JAMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAMAKO, Mali (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even in the 100-degree heat of midday, the
Niger Valley echoes with the sounds of the women beating their wash
against the stones on the river bank.
   Their back-breaking day's work will earn them an average of 250
West African francs (88 cents).
   The women, their hard work and low pay epitomize the problems
facing this West African nation shackled by constant drought and
the economic difficulties that arise from it. The World Bank ranks
Mali as one of the five poorest countries in the world, with a per
capita income of $148 a year.
   The washerwomen, all from the Dogon tribe, were driven out of
their homes in the north to Bamako four years ago by the
devastating Sahelian drought. They remain excellent vegetable
farmers and the river banks behind them bloom with radishes,
tomatoes and strawberries.
   But they live in isolation, on the outskirts of this city of 1
million. They do not speak French, Mali's official language, nor do
they know Bambara, the lingua franca of the region.
   They are tolerated by their countrymen because, for the moment,
there is no other room for them and there is still residual
sympathy for the suffering they endured in the drought of 1983 and
1984. But another dry spell could quickly make them unwanted,
another burden on a country already unable to feed itself.
   Average rainfall varies from 47.2 inches in the south, to the
desert north with less than 8 inches.
   The next drought will mean the loss of more farm land and even
more people will be forced south, toward Bamako, to compete for the
scant resources.
   This huge, largely desert or semidesert country, with its 8.4
million people spread across an area larger than California and
Texas combined has never known prosperity. According to the
economic-trends report from the U.S. Embassy, it will need
continued foreign help for the forseeable future.
   ``Despite a national commitment to economic reform and
relatively good soils in the south, cereal production has fallen in
recent years,'' the report said. ``Over the past 10 years the
climate throughout Mali, particularly the great inland delta of the
Niger, has become drier. This has resulted in serious losses of
crops and cattle, declining agricultural productivity, and
increased reliance upon donations of grains from the West.''
   The report says Mali has made serious attempts at mending its
ailing economy, forcing retirements and imposing staff cutbacks in
the public sector, but 70,000 government employees remain on the
roles, three-fourths of all salaried workers in the country.
   In 1986, while under the squeeze of economic reform, the bottom
fell out. The price of cotton, the country's chief export,
plummeted. The government discontinued much of an austerity package
that formed the basis for loans from the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank, but the IMF money stoppoed coming because the
government gave up on the austerity commitment.
   Now Mali is broke.
   Teachers, on strike since mid-February for salaries three months
in arrears, have been joined by students demanding that scholarship
payments be brought up to date.
   President Moussa Traore said recently he hoped the 18-month-long
``misunderstanding'' with the IMF could be cleared up and loans
would be coming again.
   ``We have said that we favor the structural adjustment program,
but we also favor the preservation of our human dignity, and
despite our difficulties, the world economic situation, and drought
_ which we do not control _ we want people to understand us,'' he
told a news conference.
   ``Structural adjustment does not mean throwing workers into the
streets without compensation. Nor does it mean dismantling the
economy of a country or destroying the basis of an economy. We are
still expecting help from our partners.''

<HEAD>Ruben Blades and the Beanfield War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO PEREZ RIVERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   March is salsa star Ruben Blades' month: His new
album is being released and his latest movie, ``The Milagro
Beanfield War,'' opens.
   Blades, who writes most of his songs, also has a master's degree
in law from Harvard University. How does he find time to do so much?
   ``The answer is that I am very well organized,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``I select chunks of time based on my interest, I
block that time and when it arrives I do only what that time has
been devoted for.
   ``I begin to plan things usually a year or two before the event
occurs. Even if at the time the event doesn`t seem like its going
to happen, I begin to plan for that event.
   ``My interests are so diverse,'' he added, ``that I keep
surprising everybody by literally jumping from one thing to another
and yet to another. For instance, when I went to Harvard to do my
master's, I didn't perform. During those two years, 1984 and 1985,
I devoted my time to studying. I wrote some songs on the side, so
to speak, but I didn't perform at all.''
   After getting his degree, Blades went to New Mexico to shoot
``The Milagro Beanfield War,'' directed by Robert Redford, in 1986.
It was his first screen appearence since teaming up with Whoopi
Goldberg in ``Fatal Beauty,'' which was released that same year.
   The year 1985 saw the release of ``Crossover Dreams,'' a
controversial film of dashed hopes and hot salsa in El Barrio,
starring Blades and directed by the Cuban-American filmmaker Leon
Ichaso.
   ``Ichaso has a very good eye for the absurd, which I think is a
tremendous asset for anyone,'' Blades said, talking about his work
with various directors. ``Redford, being an actor himself, is a
very patient director, very protective. They both make actors feel
very comfortable,'' he said.
   ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' will open in New York and Los
Angeles March 18, and nationwide on April 1. Blades' LP, ``Nothing
But The Truth,'' will be released also on March 18, according to
Elektra Records.
   The 39-year-old Blades, who was born in Panama and moved to the
United States in 1974, described ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' as
``a comedy with a very serious point.''
   The movie, based on the novel of the same title by John
Nicholson, is about the frictions and disputes between outside
developers and local residents of a little, fictional town in New
Mexico called Milagro.
   Blades portrays Bernabe Montoya. ``He is the man in the middle.
He is part of the community, but he has been appointed as a sheriff
by the developers. ... He is the only one that has a genuine,
independent outlook of both sides.''
   Blades said Latin actors have more opportunity for film work
today than 15 or 20 years ago. ``I think that because of the rising
interest of the Anglo public toward the Latin culture and because
of the impact of the political realities in Central and South
America, new opportunities are given now to Latin actors and also
Latin directors,'' Blades said.
   ``And I think this is a trend that will continue.''

<HEAD>Plans To Revitalize Atlanta's `Sweet Auburn' District Conflict</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Sweet Auburn,'' long the lifeline of black
Atlanta's business community, has lost its luster, and
revitalization plans are hobbled by disagreement over what should
be done in the district where Martin Luther King Jr. preached and
Louis Armstrong played.
   The city's Auburn Avenue area was a child of segregation. For
years, a soaring black middle and professional class was allowed to
do business or offer services nowhere else. In 1956, Fortune
magazine called Auburn Avenue the richest black business district
in America.
   The avenue was a cradle of the civil rights movement. But it was
the movement's success that eventually disseminated the middle
classes to other parts of Atlanta and started Sweet Auburn on its
decline.
   Whether it can be renovated without its few remaining businesses
being ``gentrified,'' and whether the old flavor can or should be
restored, are issues along the avenue.
   ``Whatever is proposed, the older people in the area seem to
disagree with it,'' said Gordon Joiner, a former chairman of the
Martin Luther King Historical District Development Corp. ``They all
seem to agree that the area needs to be revitalized, but that's
where the agreement stops.''
   King's Ebenezer Baptist Church, his birthplace and his tomb are
on Auburn Avenue, and some redevelopment proposals center on that.
   The development corporation envisions reverting part of the
avenue to the way it was when King was young. Others want to
revitalize the entire district into an area where people again will
come to do business, using its past as a tourist draw.
   Atlanta has budgeted $2.4 million this year for Auburn
Avenue-area landscaping, improvements on the still-functioning
Municipal Market building and historic facade renovation. The city
also hopes to get some help from the National Trust for Historic
Preservation.
   Most grant money for the Auburn district has gone to the east
end where the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social
Change sits and not to the dilapidated commercial sector.
   Nearly 500,000 visitors a year travel the two-mile-long avenue
from downtown Atlanta to the King Center.
   En route, visitors pass a few remaining bars, beauty shops,
small restaurants and boarded-up businesses. They pass a four-story
brick shell of a building with the names of lawyers, dentists,
accountants and doctors in peeling paint on the remaining shards of
windows.
   Prostitution and drug deals flourish along the avenue, a
high-crime area at night.
   The poor and the prostitutes were always there.
   The Rev. William Borders, 82, who just finished his 50th year as
pastor at the Wheat Street Baptist Church, remembers being
propositioned years ago. ``They used to make a pass at me and I
would say, `Don't you know who I am? I'm the preacher,' and they
would say, `I don't care who you are. Do you want to date me or
not?'''
   Borders came to the avenue in the 1920s. ``It was a lot rougher
out there then than it is now,'' he said.
   ``My mother used to tell us we were born too late to be in
slavery and too early to be out of slavery.''
   Borders was instrumental in getting some substandard housing
replaced by projects.
   Atlanta's most prestigious black churches are still there, along
with the national offices of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference; black fraternal lodges; one of the nation's first
black-owned radio stations, WERD; and the Atlanta Daily World, the
nation's oldest black-owned daily newspaper.
   The Masonic building, built by blacks in the early years of the
century, sits atop an underground river. ``I'm proud to say we
built it, and proud to say we ain't seen a drop of water yet,''
said X.L. Neal, the Grand Master.
   Old-line Atlantans remember the area for some of the best food
in town, and an alluring smoky pungence from the Auburn Avenue Rib
Shack is comforting assurance that not everything has changed.
   Over time, the region became known as ``Sweet Auburn.'' In the
1930s and '40s Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong and others packed
patrons into the Top Hat Club, now long closed.
   The Royal Peacock hosted another generation of black
entertainers such as Otis Redding and Ray Charles. It hung on for
25 years until it closed in 1973.
   The Peacock has been leased by two white entrepreneurs who plan
to reopen the second-story walkup as a blues and rock showcase.
   ``What visitors see of (black) Atlanta is a poor reflection of
what the Auburn Avenue area was all about,'' said Daniel Moore,
director of APEX, a privately funded organization building a
permanent display of Atlanta's black history on the avenue.
   ``For a number of years there have been plans for Auburn Avenue
but no one has taken the task seriously,'' he said. He said a
recent study about what might be done cost $240,000 and was one of
a half-dozen over the past 10 years, all of them expensive.
   ``I don't see much chance of anything major being done before
the (Democratic National) Convention,'' scheduled for Atlanta in
July, he said.
   Politically, more has been said than done about the area, and no
unified leadership has emerged.
   ``There are a number of factions on the avenue, and the avenue
does not have a czar to speak for all factions,'' said Portia
Scott, whose family has published the Daily World since 1928.
``There are a whole lot of themes here, not just Martin Luther
King.''
   Ben E. Smith, a lifelong Auburn Avenue area resident and
nightclub owner, agrees.
   Of a move to put city funds from a defunct project into the
area, Smith said recently, ``I'll make sure the King Center doesn't
get everything. Everything can't go to the gravesite.''
   Smith, who heads the Sweet Auburn Merchants and Professionals
Association, is urging unity among the remaining businesses to
assure their interests are covered in any revitalization plans.
   Smith, Ms. Scott and others fought hard against plans to tear
out seven businesses on the avenue to make room for a black studies
library and research center. Fulton County officials have agreed to
try to find an existing vacant building for the center instead.
   ``There is a diehard need for restoration that does not displace
the merchants,'' Smith said, adding that it is equally important to
``keep the history and character of Sweet Auburn,'' a street
described by many Atlantans as one of the few in town with any
character left.

<HEAD>CBS Beefing Up Schedule with Comedies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS is beefing up its schedule with four new
comedies, but from the looks of the first three, the shows
themselves will need some beefing up before they will help CBS.
   Because of its hour-drama-heavy schedule, the network wants more
half-hour sitcoms. Thus ``Eisenhower & Lutz'' premieres tonight in
two half hours, before and after ``Newhart.'' Its regular time
period will be Monday in place of ``Frank's Place,'' which moves to
Tuesday.
   ``Trial and Error'' and ``Coming of Age'' make their debuts
Tuesday. A fourth comedy, ``The Dictator,'' also was to have
premiered Tuesday, but it has been delayed by the writers' strike.
In the meantime, CBS will bring back ``My Sister Sam.''
   The most promising of the three new comedies is ``Trial and
Error.'' It falters occasionally in the premiere half hour, but
mostly lands on its feet, thanks to the comic abilities of its two
stars, Eddie Velez and Paul Rodriguez.
   Velez plays John Hernandez, a clean-cut young lawyer just hired
by a big Los Angeles law firm. His childhood friend and now
roommate, Tony Rivera (Rodriguez), is a T-shirt entrepreneur.
   Rodriguez, a stand-up comic, delivers the one-liners with
professional aplomb. He takes his buddy to a fancy restaurant to
celebrate his new job. The waiter lists the specials, including
goat cheese, $8: ``Goat cheese eight dollars?'' complains Rivera.
``I got a buddy in Alhambra who'll sell me the whole goat for
four.''
   Velez's forte is physical comedy. Acting cool in his new office
with his modular phone, he whips the receiver around on its
elasticized wire, but ends up having to hide from it when it gets
out of control.
   The show doesn't make any heavy social points, but does manage a
meaningful plotline when Hernandez faces the fact that he was hired
by the law firm because he is Hispanic. The senior partner
dismisses his protests by telling him there was a time he would
have been rejected because of it. At Rivera's urging, he decides to
take the break for what it's worth.
   ``Eisenhower & Lutz'' also shows promise with occasionally crisp
writing and a likable star, Scott Bakula, playing a Palm Springs
shyster who's practicing alone but thought Eisenhower on the firm's
name sounded prestigious.
   His secretary quits over her pay. ``Remember two months ago when
I interviewed for a job and we discussed salary and I said, yes, I
wanted one?''
   So his girlfriend (DeLane Matthews), a cocktail waitress, fills
in, typing up his resume before his meeting with a big law firm he
thinks might hire him. He notes she included his alma mater,
Southeast School of Law. ``I thought we were going to dress that up
a little,'' says he. Says she, ``I took `and acupuncture' off.''
   The series is from MTM Productions and executive producer Allan
Burns, an Emmy-winning writer formerly with ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Show.'' The lines are smart enough, but the series needs to develop
some heart.
   ``Coming of Age'' was apparently meant to be kind of a co-ed
``Golden Girls.'' It stars Paul Dooley as Dick Hale, a
wise-cracking former airline pilot from Pittsburgh reluctantly
relocated to a sunny retirement village in the Southwest with his
wife, Ginny (Phyllis Newman).
   The comedy in the premiere episode is broad and sluggish, though
Dooley can almost pull it off. ``That's 27,'' he says, gazing out
the window as his wife unpacks. ``What are you counting?'' she
asks. ``Gray heads,'' he says.
   Alan Young and Glynis Johns play neighbors Ed and Trudie Pepper,
who come over bearing a welcome pie. Turns out Ed baked the pie.
   ``So, basically, Ed,'' says Dick, ``you retired and became a
woman.''
   Even Dooley can't manage for long with material like this.
   The fourth comedy, ``The Dictator,'' features Christopher Lloyd,
best known to TV audiences as Rev. Jim on ``Taxi,'' as Joseph
Domino, supreme ruler of the South Sea island nation of Bando.
After the overthrow of his government, he is exiled to Rego Park,
Queens. The premise sounds great, but it's a bad sign if the series
has to be halted because there are too few scripts for even a
limited spring run. When the series does premiere, look forward to
seeing Bob Elliott of the comedy team Bob and Ray as guest star.

<HEAD>Most Important Private Collection of Jewish Art in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years after the Nazis closed the
world's first museum of Jewish art in Vienna, a private exhibit of
Jewish ritual objects has been drawing large crowds of visitors.
   Some 800 items displayed at the ``Judentum in Wien'' (``Jews in
Vienna'') exhibit housed by the Museum of the History of Vienna are
all loans from a private Judaica collection, regarded by art
historians as one the most important private collections of Jewish
life.
   According to Max Berger, owner of the collection, most of the
drawings, paintings, sculptures, medals, coins, manuscripts and
handicraft on show were in danger of being destroyed or lost after
Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938.
   Berger, a Viennese businessman who survived a Nazi concentration
camp, pieced together his collection over years and this is the
first time it has been shown in public.
   The exhibit displays mementoes of Jewish life from the early
18th century until present, focusing on Vienna as an important
center in the history of European Jewry. Museum officials said it
is the first step toward opening a permanent Jewish museum here in
the next two or three years.
   About 6,000 Jews live in Vienna today, compared with 200,000 who
helped make this city a capital of science, culture and the arts
before World War II. They included Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler,
Stefan Zweig, Arnold Schoenberg and hundreds of others.
   Some 65,000 Austrian Jews perished in Nazi concentration and
death camps during the war.
   The exhibit is divided into eight sections, including ritual
objects and Hebrew writings, the Jewish year and life, the history
of the Viennese Jews, Zionism, anti-semitism and persecution and
Jewish contributions to art and culture.
   ``It's the first time that the most important private Judaica
collection in Europe is displayed for the Austrian public after the
war,'' Karl-Albrecht Weinberger, a curator who helped set up the
display, said in an interview.
   By March 3, the exhibit had been visited by some 30,000 people.
   ``On Saturdays and Sundays we have up to 500 visitors a day,''
Weinberger said, adding that recently Austrian school authorities
advised schools to come and see the exhibit as part of their
history classes.
   More young Austrians gradually have been educated about the Nazi
past and the Holocaust in the two years since the first disclosures
that President Kurt Waldheim had covered up his wartime past as a
German army lieutenant in the Balkans.
   Weinberger said the exhibit was planned before Waldheim became
president.
   The most valuable objects displayed are a silver-and-gold torah
crown made in Austria in 1810 and a torah plaque made in 1806 of
gold-covered silver.
   The oldest display is a torah curtain made around 1700 of red
velvet laced with silver threads.
   Weinberger said the first Jewish Museum in the world opened in
Vienna in 1895, with a very big collection of Jewish art.
   The Nazis dismantled it in 1938. While some items were lost or
destroyed, others were taken by the Germans to Prague where they
planned to open a big anti-semitic Jewish museum. The museum never
materialized but some objects have remained in the Prague Jewish
Museum which opened after the war.
   Asked if the Austrians ever asked the Czechs to return the items
held by the Vienna Museum, Weinberger said they never did.
   ``It's difficult to prove what objects belonged to the Jewish
Vienna Museum as all catalog were destroyed during the war,'' he
said.

   Igor Perlovsky is a big man in Dickson.
He runs the only bar in town. He owns the only VCR.
   And for the 5,000 Soviets who inhabit the world's northernmost

``Coupole'' lounge are a cherished escape from the 10 months of
winter when temperatures plunge to 75 degrees below zero and the

   Outdoor sports are out of the question on the desolate ice
desert that stretches more than 300 miles from here to the south.
Even for those hardy enough to play outdoors, it's hard to see a
soccer ball during the three-month polar night. Nor is there
swimming during the two-month ``summer,'' when the mercury climbs
to an average high of 40.
   There used to be an automobile in Dickson, which is reachable
only by air and sea, but the novelty of driving on the city's three
or four roads wore off, and the 11-year-old Moskvich subcompact has
been garaged with only 70 kilometers (44 miles) on the odometer.
   Every few weeks, a resident sights a polar bear lumbering along
the moguled ice paths that pass for streets, and telling tales of
narrow escapes from the Arctic's natural inhabitants is a popular
pasttime.
   Police sometimes are summoned to chase the bears away by firing
rifles into the air, but they are forbidden to shoot the beasts
except in life-threatening situations: polar bears are protected by
the Soviet Red Book, the endangered species list.
   At first glance, Dickson appears uninhabited. The plume from a
single smokestack atop the city's steam-generating plant provides
the first sign of life. On closer inspection, a few fur-hatted
pedestrians can be seen bobbing between the snowbanks. The silence
is broken by the roar of a jeep or the thrashing of a tracked
``vezdekhod'' _ the refitted armored personnel carriers that serve
as Dickson's police cars, ambulances and buses.
   The city, which lies 500 miles inside the Arctic Circle and
1,100 miles below the North Pole, is named for Oskar Dickson, a
Swedish brewer and financier who bankrolled the international
expedition that discovered the port in 1875. Dickson's retention of
his name through a century of political tumult in Russia is
evidence of its isolation from Moscow and the official penchant for
renaming places for Soviet heroes.
   The first settlers arrived in Dickson in 1915 to operate a radio
transmitter at the port. By World War II, a few hundred were living
here to handle shipping on the Yenisei River that flows into the
Kara just to the south.
   Today, Dickson's port is the gateway to the Northern Sea Route
that provides Europe's only direct sealink to the Pacific Ocean.
   Gennady M. Svetkov, deputy chief of the city's governing
council, said the port, which is the only major enterprise in
Dickson, generates revenues of 6 million rubles ($10 million) a
year. That figure could skyrocket if the Soviet Union reopens the
Northern Sea Route as Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev
proposed last October. It has been closed to all but Soviet vessels
since 1964.
   In winter, supply ships, shepherded by icebreakers, make their
way into the frozen port every month or so. But in July and August
the waterfront bustles as Soviet cargo ships ply the Arctic Ocean
with goods bound for Japan, China and points south.
   Increased ship traffic and the arrival of foreign crews could
change this Arctic outpost, but Dickson's city fathers regard an
international port as a distant prospect.
   ``Such decisions are in the hands of the mainlanders,'' said
Svetkov, referring to those who live beyond the tundra.
   For now, Dickson's residents appear content to bear with the
hardships to keep the sea lanes open and gather data from eight
weather research stations drifting in the Arctic Ocean.

   ``It's not so cold here,'' said 20-year-old Marina Rovenska.
``It's just boring.'' Miss Rovenska, a clerk at Dickson's shopping
center, came here with her parents from the Ukraine eight years ago.
   She and a friend, Yelena Cherevik, said young workers flock to
Perlovsky's bar several times a week for the best Dickson has in
social life.
   Perlovsky, a 36-year-old native who returned after a few years
as a seaman in Odessa on the Black Sea, where it's warm, is a
respected businessman among Dickson's youth, who are paid double
salaries for working under hardship. Perlovsky bought a German-made
video deck last year for a 10,000 rubles ($16,000) _ two years' his
salary as a state bartender _ from a friend of a friend of a
diplomat. His tapes, recorded from Finnish television or Soviet
film libraries, have been collected through a farflung network of
friends and connections. His library of about 100 titles cost him
about 100 rubles ($160) each .
   While Perlovsky is a state bartender, he is a private video
operator at the ``Coupole,'' a wood-paneled anteroom of Cafeteria
No. 1. He operates in part ``na levo'' (literally, on the left), a
Russian expression for doing things outside the law. But his video
bar exemplifies the freer hand Soviets have in remote communities
to bend the rules to make their system work.
   For 1.50 rubles ($2.50), or three times the price of a movie
ticket elsewhere in the Soviet Union, a Dickson resident can settle
down at Perlovsky's bar and watch a Soviet film classic or Western
rock video _ once everyone has agreed on the night's selection.
Liquor appears to be in greater supply here than in most areas of
the Soviet Union, again illustrating a concession from Moscow,
where Gorbachev's tough anti-drinking crusade has made alcohol both
expensive and hard to find.
   ``Some guys come in here and drink themselves into such a state
that they have to be helped home,'' said Perlovsky, who as a former
national rowing champion is equal to the task of bouncer. ``But I
wouldn't say we have an acute problem with drunkenness, at least
not like in central Russia where guys will drink up their last
kopek. Most people just want a place where they can gather.''
   Older residents cite its advantages over other areas of the
country. Crime rates are low, they say, because thieves can't flee
the city and stolen goods are hard to hide in housing that is
mostly communal.
   ``The north is like a sifter,'' observed Gennady Ilchenko, the
director of the weather station who has lived in Dickson for 37
years. ``Those who are weak or lazy or untalented fall out
quickly.''
   Schoolteacher Larissa Duvinets, a 28-year resident, says
children are taught in the city's two schools to value the northern
lifestyle and plan for futures in their parents' footsteps.
   But city officials concede that at least 20 percent of Dickson's
population turns over each year.
   ``I don't think I'll stay here after school days,'' said
13-year-old Sergei Lutsenko as he led visitors on a tour of the
city's three-room museum. ``I feel it's cut off from the outside
world.''
   He and his friends said they long for big-city life with subways
and buses _ and the simple pleasures of summer, like swimming and
going barefoot.

<TEXT>
   The Texas Hill Country seemed an odd
backdrop to talk with a man who ruled Louisiana much like a king
when he wasn't rolling dice in Monte Carlo and Las Vegas, flirting
with beautiful women or fighting off racketeering charges.
   But Gov. Edwin Edwards is preparing to leave office Monday, and
his Texas ranch has been a hideaway used more frequently by the
governor who became the most propular official in the Bayou State
since Huey Long _ until he was undone by the collapse of oil and
questions about his honesty that wouldn't go away.
   In a recent interview at the ranch overlooking the greenish
waters of the South Llano River, Edwards spoke softly about his
political career and about leaving it all behind.
   The 1,400-acre ranch is dotted with scrub oaks stunted by the
scant rainfall, a far cry from Edwards' Louisiana estate, with its
massive moss-covered oaks and enough green grass in the yard to
more than feed the 60 head of cattle barely surviving on what they
can find here.
   Still, the Texas spread is far from the swirl of politics and
controversy that has been his life.
   Edwards' brother once said, ``He's an introvert trying to be an
extrovert.''
   ``That's accurate,'' said Edwards, gently rocking and fiddling
with the bottom button of a down jacket. ``It's almost ludicrous to
say that but I've done a good job in overcoming it. I have a basic
tendency to get away. That's why I have this ranch.''
   The ranch is not so much a place to relax for Edwards, who at
60, still doesn't know how to take it easy.
   ``If he's not hunting, he's on that tractor or using a
bushhog,'' an aide told a reporter.
   The reporter recalled a comment years ago by Edwards'
brother-in-law: ``He's not relaxed like a normal Frenchman.''
   ``Maybe that's because he's ambitious,'' said Edwards'
mother-in-law.
   Edwards sprouted from impoverished south Louisiana, the son of a
sharecropper. Education was the only escape route.
   At 21 he had finished law school, and six years later, in 1954,
he was elected to the Crowley City Council. From there he was
elected to the state Senate, to Congress and finally to the
governor's office in 1972 and again in 1976.
   He never lost an election.
   He was adored by the people because he brought ``les bons
temps'' _ good times _ by prodding the Legislature to tax oil at a
percentage of value in 1973 just before prices soared. Government
was on easy street and the economy was beautiful.
   People were tolerant, even proud, of his candor when Edwards
commented that ``gambling turns me on.'' They smiled when he
flirted openly with women.
   He left office after serving two consecutive terms, the most
allowed by law, but returned in 1984 for an unprecedented third
term, overwhelming one-term Republican Dave Treen.
   Edwards was so powerful that while the Republican served, the
populist Cajun opened an unofficial governor's office and began
collecting $13 million for a campaign that kept Treen looking over
his shoulder.
   Edwards won with nearly 63 percent of the vote despite
unfavorable publicity during his first two terms:
   _ He had acknowledged receiving $20,000 from a South Korean
whose dealings with congressmen and others led to the ``Koreagate''
investigations.
   _ He had shrugged off a book written by a former aide who
accused Edwards of selling state jobs and conquering legions of
women.
   _ He was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service after all
of the publicity about his gambling.
   _ He was investigated during the FBI ``Brilab'' probe that led
to the conviction of a top aide.
   Edwards survived it all.
   But in these last four years, the king was felled by the
collapse of oil prices, which devastated the state's economy, and
continued attacks on his honesty.
   Louisiana has one of the highest unemployment rates in the
nation and the government is nearly bankrupt.
   His answer to economic woes this term was a lottery and casino
gambling, something lawmakers would not buy. Edwards lost control
of the Legislature partly because of his two federal racketeering
trials.
   He went on trial in 1985, accused of brokering hospital permits
obtained while in and out of office. The jury was hung with all but
two voting for acquittal.
   In 1986, a second jury acquitted Edwards and all other
co-defendants, including his brother, Marion, and several friends
and aides.
   ``I was shunned by the Legislature during and between trials,''
Edwards said, planting his boots on the ground to stop the rocking
chair. ``They saw how U.S. Attorney John Volz used the federal
grand juries. They were scared. `If they can do that to you, I
don't want to be close to you.' There was an aura of fear in
Louisiana. If Volz and the other Republicans could do that to me,
what could they do to legislators? That was the feeling.''
   The polls showed that the people went along with the lottery
idea and feeling the masses were still behind him, Edwards tried
last year for a fourth term.
   As a 44-year-old congressman, he had first swept into the
governor's office on a reform platform. At age 60, he was beaten by
Buddy Roemer, a 44-year-old congressman who used a reform platform,
complaining that Edwards had given Louisiana a banana republic
image.
   ``There's always been a mania to knock the man from the top of
the mountain,'' said Edwards. ``But it took them a lot of years.
It's been a costly journey to the top.
   ``In the last four years, it's been even worse. My family has
suffered. My net worth has gone down considerably. I've paid an
awesome price, onslaughts on my integrity from unfair
investigations, indictments. But I think I've faced it
realistically and altruistically.''
   In a 1979 interview, Edwards was reminded that he said that what
he would like more than anything else ``is to convince people I'm
honest.''
   ``I guess that is more what I would like to do now than ever,
but it seems like it is something that is going to escape me,'' he
said.
   ``But I remind the people that despite all of the money spent,
all of the efforts made by people over the years, they've yet to
prove anything.''
   What's going to happen now? Can Edwards relax?
   ``For about four days,'' he said, grinning. ``I guess the phones
will continue ringing, people will still come to see me. I feel
nothing is going to happen with a new administration. If that's
true, I will be sought out. If not, I'll try to accept that.''
   In the meantime, Edwards will practice law with one of his sons
and offer himself to the nation's universities as a lecturer for
$5,000 per appearance. He'll talk about legalized gambling and his
career.
   He'll also hunt, gamble and, yes, flirt.
   ``I don't believe I've mellowed with age,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ballot Box Brings Big Changes To Selma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STRAT DOUTHAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spring has come to central Alabama: the
redbuds are blooming, the fire ants are pushing up fresh mounds of
earth and Jesse Jackson is the people's choice in Dallas County,
where the infamous ``bloody Sunday'' attack at the Edmund Pettus
Bridge shocked the nation 23 years ago.
   Jackson overwhelmed the presidential primary field here Tuesday,
23 years and one day after Alabama state troopers savagely beat
black voting rights advocates attempting to march from Selma to
Montgomery. The episode, shown on national television, helped
galvanize Congress to pass the federal Voting Rights Act later that
year.
   On Tuesday, Jackson carried Alabama by a narrow margin. But he
held better than a 5-to-1 edge over his nearest Democratic
challenger in Dallas County, where blacks constitute 55 percent of
the 50,000 residents.
   The official county tally showed Jackson with 4,872 votes to 923
for the runner-up, Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee. Vice President
George Bush easily won the Republican race with 1,282 votes.
   Selma Mayor Joe Smitherman, who was serving his first term when
bloody Sunday took place, said he thinks a lot of white Democrats
didn't vote but would have gone for Bush if they'd been able to
cross over. However, he acknowledges that blacks gave Jackson an
undeniably smashing victory in Selma and Dallas County.
   ``The black community really turned out for Jesse. He was here a
week before the election, and I accompanied him as he walked
through a poor, black section of town,'' said Smitherman, who
admits he was a segregationist back when it was fashionable.
   ``You had to be a segregationist to be elected in the South when
I was starting out,'' said the 58-year-old mayor. ``But we've
matured, I've matured. We were wrong to try and deny people their
right to vote, and I'm sorry for what we did.''
   Given the changes that have occurred in Selma, Smitherman said,
it's really no surprise Jackson did so well.
   However, the man who led the bloody Sunday march, Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., professed amazement that a black could score such a
victory in Dallas County.
   ``To me it is simply unbelievable,'' said Lewis, when contacted
at his Washington, D.C., office. ``When Hosea Williams and I led
that march back in 1965, only 2.1 percent of Dallas County's black
residents were registered to vote.''
   Since then, Smitherman points out, a lot of the Alabama River
has flowed beneath the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
   ``When I was first elected mayor in 1964 only 50 percent of our
streets were paved and less than half of our homes were connected
to the sewage system. But after 1965 we started taking advantage of
the federal programs and grants that existed at the time. Now,
every street is paved and the sewage system is all over town.
   ``Also, we now have an appointed black county school
superintendent who makes more damned money than I do. Half of the
city council is black and the assistant police chief is black.
Blacks probably have made more progress in Selma than in any other
white-controlled city in the Alabama.''
   The Rev. Joseph Rembert, pastor of Brown's Chapel where the
bloody Sunday march began, acknowledges there have been changes in
Selma. But he adds that whites still hold most of the power and
that many of the changes have come about as the result of federal
court actions initiated by blacks.
   ``Attitudes are slowly changing in Selma,'' he said. ``But, like
most places, we've still got a long way to go. What we really need
here, desperately, is jobs; our county unemployment rate runs about
16 percent and it's probably as high as 25 percent for blacks.''
   Rembert adds, though, that he would rather be one of Selma's
27,000 residents than live in a big, Northern city like New York.
   ``We don't have a utopia here but at least when we stage a
protest these days nobody gets hurt. Blacks and whites may fight to
the bone over an issue but when it's over they also may go off and
have lunch together, and that's a big change from the past.''
   Edwin Moss, one of the city's three black city councilmen, said
he has seen many changes during the 73 years he has lived in Selma.
   ``We've made some big political strides in this county, and
we've made social progress, too,'' said Moss, who founded and
manages a federal credit union with a largely black membership.
   ``Now,'' he added, ``we need economic progress. We need jobs. We
need financing for black-owned businesses.''
   Smitherman, in the midst of his sixth four-year term, agrees
Selma needs more jobs, but he's obviously proud of his city, with
its wide main street and gracious neighborhoods. He points out he
couldn't be mayor without the support of both blacks and whites and
is quick to show visitors his accomplishments in integrating
government and improving the local standard of living.
   ``That's why I, personally, like Jesse Jackson's message,'' he
said. ``He's talking about the same things I deal with as mayor.
He's talking about jobs, about the problems of working people,
about the homeless and the poor.''
   ``You know,'' he said, ``Jesse reminds me a lot of George
Wallace, 20 years ago. They're both populists.''
   Yet, he said, neither he nor most other local whites voted for
Jackson last Tuesday.
   ``It's funny, but you'll hear a group of whites talking politics
and somebody will say, `Jesse makes more sense than any of them.'
Then he'll up and add that he's voting for Bush or Gore. A black's
just not going to get many white votes around here, not yet at
least,'' Smitherman said. ``I don't know why I didn't vote for
Jesse, maybe it's because I don't think he can win.''
   At present, there is only one elected black county official in
Dallas County, which is under a federal court mandate to create
four voting districts _ two predominantly white and two
predominantly black _ by the fall election.
   That one black official is District Judge Nathaniel Walker, who
left Selma and got his law degree at Fordham University, then
returned home. Walker, the first black to hold countywide office
here, said he is heartened by the changes he has seen in his
hometown.
   ``I was among the marchers who were attacked on bloody Sunday,''
he said. ``Back then, the courthouse was off limits for blacks, it
was a place to be feared.
   ``But Jesse's victory is an example of what we were fighting
for. Last Tuesday's election shows that the people recognize just
how dear is their right to vote and that they're determined to
exercise their franchise.''
   John Lewis, who was hospitalized for two days with injuries he
received on bloody Sunday, said much the same thing.
   ``That's what the civil rights movement was all about,'' Lewis
said. ``We were trying to build a bi-racial democracy in Alabama
and throughout the South. Jesse Jackson's overwhelming victory in a
place like Selma proves this is possible.''

   World oil-producing nations, aware that they
cannot afford another 1986-style market collapse, probably will
succeed in bringing an end to the recent erosion of prices _ at
least temporarily, analysts say.
   After three months of declines, hopes of a turnaround stirred
with a report from Paris that officials of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries were studying a plan to shave 5
percent off the production of all 13 members except Iraq.
   Analysts said the report sent oil futures broadly higher
Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, even though it later
was denied by OPEC officials.

   This is a continuation of the threat the union has made since a

have been free to strike but have not done so, and the airline had
been free to impose its latest contract offer.

<HEAD>Chrysler, UAW Could Begin Early Contract Negotiations Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber says he
is optimistic that early contract negotiations with Chrysler Corp.
will produce an early settlement and soothe Chrysler's bruised
labor relations.
   The UAW's 140-member national Chrysler bargaining council,
representing 71,700 Chrysler workers, voted Thursday to grant
Chrysler's request for early talks.
   ``If I was overly pessimistic, I doubt that we would have called
the meeting today or taken the action that we did,'' said Bieber,
who along with UAW vice president Marc Stepp had urged the council
approve the request.
   No date has been set for the talks aimed at replacing the
existing three-year contract that expires Sept. 14, but they could
begin as soon as late April. Talks usually begin in midsummer.
   There will be no strike deadline, but the two sides will set a
target date for a settlement when they decide a starting date for
the talks.
   ``The company is hopeful that a new contract that is equitable
to both sides can be reached expeditiously,'' said Chrysler
spokesman Lloyd Northard.
   Bieber said the union will seek a two-year contract so that in
1990, all Big Three automakers' contracts can be negotiated
together for the first time since the union reopened its Chrysler
contract in 1979 to make concessions needed by the company.
   Last fall, the union negotiated a job-protecting industry
pattern contract at Ford Motor Co. The contract quickly was
accepted at GM, leaving only Chrysler workers without its
protections this year.
   The union would not have agreed to early talks if Chrysler had
not indicated it was willing to accept the pattern as a basis for
negotiations, giving Chrysler workers.
   The relationship between the UAW and Chrysler has been badly
injured in the past few months by Chrysler's abortive attempt to
sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.
   To block the plan, which the union said was a threat to
companywide job security, angry workers prepared for a series of
crippling plant-by-plant strikes and stopped participating in
critical union-manangement programs for improving productivity and
quality.
   Last week, Chrysler backed down and Stepp moved quickly to
settle a dispute at a key stamping plant in Sterling Heights, where
the first strike was to occur. Weekend talks brought a settlement
early Monday morning.
   But Stepp didn't tell workers to renew participation the joint
programs until the Thursday meeting, after he received a written
promise that top Chrysler executives will resume monthly meetings
with top union officials.
   In the past two years the Chrysler-UAW ``round table,'' where
union and company officials had consulted on major decisions since
its creation in 1979, met only once, Stepp said.
   Stepp said the lack of round table meetings indicated Chrysler
had changed its attitude toward its workers for the worse.
   With the agreement of Chrysler chief negotiator Anthony St. John
to resume the meetings, Stepp said he believes workers' anger will
ease.
   The two sides still must work out an Acustar-related sore point.
Chrysler said it will close four Acustar plants if it can't sell
them within 18 months. The UAW wants to protect the plants' 2,000
workers.
   During the week of March 20, national union officials and the
elected 10-member rank-and-file Chrysler negotiating team will draw
up their demands and strategies for fitting established auto
industry contracts to Chrysler.
   The GM and Ford contracts prohibit plant closings unless
production is cut because of slow sales, make the transfer of work
to outside suppliers more difficult and slow the rate of attrition.
   They also contain a profit-sharing formula based on the
companies' U.S. performance. At Ford, workers reaped average
profit-sharing checks of more than $3,700 apiece from Ford's record
$4.6 billion profit.
   Chrysler workers have no profit-sharing formula and instead
receive a $500 bonus annually regardless of their company's
performance.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Low Profits In Computer, Communications Hardware</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies making computer hardware and
communications equipment may be growing rapidly, but a private
survey released today finds many have been less profitable than the
general run of American companies during recent years.
   Intense competition from Japan and other foreign rivals is one
reason for the profit squeeze on those companies, according to
Harvey Poppel, a partner in Broadview Associates of Fort Lee, N.J.,
the investment banking firm that conducted the survey.
   A Broadview survey of 269 U.S.-based hardware and equipment
companies found they had a median return on equity of 6.5 percent
in 1987, with a large number of poorly performing small companies
dragging down the results.
   Poppel said the median return on equity for major American
companies is typically about 11 or 12 percent.
   Return on equity is a widely used measure of a company's
performance. It is the company's profit as a percentage of its
shareholders' equity, or net worth.
   When the survey results were adjusted to give the heaviest
weight to the companies with the biggest stock market values, such
as highly profitable International Business Machines Corp., the
average return on equity was 10.7 percent, roughly in line with the
average for American business.
   Broadview Associates specializes in mergers and acquisitions in
the computer software and services industry. Poppel said a survey
of nearly 200 of those companies found their return on equity was
above average _ about 18.6 percent last year.
   Poppel cited several reasons for the difficulties of the
computer hardware and communications equipment companies:
   _Japan and other aggressive competitors are willing to accept
lower profit margins to gain shares of the world market.
   _Many nations protect their home markets and domestic companies,
especially in the case of Western Europe with telecommunications
equipment.
   _Products have short life cycles, giving companies only a short
time to recoup their heavy investments.
   _It is easy for new companies to enter the market, especially at
the low end, because the basic components such as computer chips
are readily available.
   In contrast, Poppel said the information services companies have
higher return on equity because their offerings cannot easily be
rendered obsolete with new technology and are protected by high
barriers to entry of new competitors.
   Prices of products such as software and database services can be
kept relatively high and companies have fewer expensive assets such
as factories, Poppel noted.

<HEAD>Anti-Dumping Showdown In Canada Over Hyundai</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All dollar figures are U.S. unless otherwise noted.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a marketing phenomenon that turned into
the focus of an international battle with multibillion-dollar
implications.
   Within a year of introducing its $4,500 Pony subcompact to North
America in 1984, Hyundai Corp. of South Korea captured 7 percent of
the Canadian market. It then invaded the United States and sold
168,182 of its Excels in just 10 months.
   But were the Koreans exploiting a market void or unfairly
dumping the autos at below-cost prices in order to grab a share of
the lucrative market?
   The Canadian Import Tribunal is considering evidence from four
weeks of hearings that concluded Thursday over claims by domestic
automakers such as General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. of
unfair pricing by Hyundai. Hyundai could be slapped with a 26
percent duty if found to be dumping cars.
   The case has worldwide implications as America's car giants
compete against Asian rivals who've grabbed more than 25 percent of
their auto market.
   A ruling is expected March 23 and both sides have the right to
appeal.
   In anti-dumping hearings held in Ottawa, GM and Ford
subsidiaries in Canada accused Hyundai of purposely setting
below-cost prices to grab a niche in the competitive small-car
market.
   The carmakers asked the Canadian Import Tribunal to uphold
Revenue Canada's preliminary finding last November that Hyundai has
been dumping Pony, Excel and Stellar hatchbacks and sedans in
Canada at an average 26 percent cheaper than they cost in South
Korea.
   A 26-percent duty would add more than $1,000 to the price of
Hyundais in 182 showrooms across Canada and could lead to similar
cases against other foreign makes.
   GM and Ford told the tribunal they were forced to slash prices
and offer cash rebates in order to compete with Hyundai's
bargain-basement approach.
   ``Future injury is going to take the form of reduced production,
reduced employment and reduced utilization of productive
capacity,'' Penny Bonner, legal counsel for the two companies,
testified Thursday.
   Hyundai acknowledged using Canada as a spearhead to penetrate
the American market, but argued that it never hurt GM or Ford
because the rear-wheel-drive Pony had no direct competition at the
bottom end of the market.
   ``The Pony was swept along because in a real sense there was no
competition,'' said Hyundai lawyer Richard Gottlieb. He termed the
success of the ``nice little car'' a fluke, coming right at the end
of a recession when American carmakers virtually had given up on
the sub-compact market.
   In surprising testimony on Thursday, lawyers for the Canadian
government's Consumer Affairs Department supported Hyundai. They
said the Korean company answered a need ignored by North American
manufacturers, thereby helping consumers.
   Hyundai zoomed to a 21 percent share of the small-car market in
Canada in 1985 with sales of 79,072 Ponies and Stellars.
   But since the preliminary anti-dumping ruling, the Canadian
subsidiary has been in a tailspin and some dealers have resigned,
according to company spokesman Greg Young.
   ``It destroyed us in the marketplace in terms of public
perception and confidence in the product,'' Young said.
   While still the third-ranked import behind Honda and Toyota,
Hyundai expects to sell just 45,000 cars this year, led by the
Excel, which starts at $5,835.
   ``People may say, `I like the Honda Civic but before making up
my mind I'm going to take a look at the Excel.' But the Honda
salesman just says, `Why bother?' because of the possible duties,''
Young said.
   But he said the bad publicity has not reached the United States,
and American Hyundai sales are still climbing after reaching
263,610 cars last year.
   To save the day in Canada, Hyundai has launched a ``Here To Stay
and Proud Of It'' TV and newspaper advertising campaign.
   It pledged to proceed with a $259 million manufacturing plant in
Bromont, Quebec, and $16 million parts factory in Newmarket,
Ontario. Scheduled to open later this year, the plants will create
1,300 jobs and give Hyundai the capacity to make 100,000 new-model
compacts a year.
   The plants will expand a Canadian car industry that grew out of
the milestone 1965 Auto Pact with the United States which permits
vehicles and parts to move duty-free across the border. Dominated
by GM, Ford and Chrysler subsidiaries, the Canadian car and truck
plants employ 140,000 workers with another 400,000 related jobs.
   Young said Hyundai will remain in business here, but may be
forced to reassess operations if anti-dumping duties are imposed.
   ``It may be step one against all import car companies, against
all competition,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lorimar Gets $780 Million Bid from Marvin Davis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER GILLOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Marvin Davis is seeking to
get back into the entertainment business by making an unsolicited
$770.1 million offer for troubled Lorimar Telepictures Corp. and
has indicated he may be willing to go even higher.
   Davis' $17-per-share cash buyout offer was disclosed Thursday,
only three days after Lorimar announced it was holding preliminary
talks about a possible acquisition by New York-based entertainment
conglomerate Warner Communications Inc.
   A source close to the situation indicated Davis, the former
owner of 20th Century Fox Film Corp., was ``very serious'' about
acquiring Lorimar, the Culver City-based entertainment concern best
known as the producer of such television programs as `Dallas'' and
``Knots Landing.''
   Lorimar appeared to give short shrift to the proposal, stating
that it ``would bear Davis' letter in mind.''
   Lorimar stock rose $1 to close at $15.37{ on the American Stock
Exchange after the announcement of Davis' offer. The company has
45.3 million common shares outstanding.
   Davis made his offer in a letter to Lorimar management.
   On Monday, Lorimar and Warner announced they had entered
preliminary merger talks over the weekend.
   Analysts have suggested Lorimar's stock is worth between $14 and
$20 per share.
   Lorimar is a leading producer of original television
programming, but in recent years has been troubled as its ambitious
plans to expand into other areas disintegrated, sometimes causing
the company to incur losses or heavy costs that depressed earnings.
   For the first nine months of its current fiscal year, Lorimar
posted a loss of $82.6 million on revenue of $616.8 million. The
deficit included $45 million in writedowns on five movies and $22
million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video
unit.
   The company replaced managements of both the movie and
home-video units.
   For the fiscal year ended last March 31, the company lost $58.6
million, mostly because of restructuring costs, on revenue of
$766.2 million.
   Davis has been seeking to get back into the entertainment
industry since selling Fox to media magnate Rupert Murdoch in 1985
for $575 million. Davis had owned Fox for four years, but the
company was beset by persistent losses.
   Last year, he made an unsuccessful $321.9 million bid for the
90.6 percent he didn't already own of Texas-based Spectradyne Inc.,
the nation's largest supplier of cable television and pay-per-view
movies for hotels.
   On Wednesday, four disgruntled shareholders filed a class action
lawsuit against Lorimar in federal court alleging the company
overstated its income and net worth and did not reveal problems
with its home-video unit, thereby causing investors to pay more for
stock then they believed they should have.

<HEAD>AFG Suitor Presses Buyout Bid as Investment Firm Bows Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AFG Industries Inc. is left with a single suitor
following an investment partnership's decision not to top the $940
million buyout bid the glassmaker already has accepted from its
chairman.
   Forstmann Little & Co., which previously indicated it might be
willing to make a higher offer, said Thursday it decided against
making an offer based on its review of AFG's internal records and
its ``adherence to strict acquisition criteria.''
   A company led by AFG's founder and chairman, R.D. Hubbard,
stated from AFG headquarters in Irvine, Calif., that it intended to
proceed with its earlier offer to take AFG private in buyout valued
at $33 a share.
   AFG's stock finished down $5 a share at $31.62{ in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Larry Selwitz, a securities analyst for the investment firm
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles, said the odds
favored Hubbard's bid for the company. ``I would be really
hard-pressed to see who might come into it now,'' he said.
   Another analyst, Donald Pattison of Cyrus J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell in New York, said Forstmann probably decided against
proceeding because of the strong possibility that Hubbard would
leave the company. ``He'd go off with his own company and probably
eat their lunch,'' Pattison said.
   Forstmann Little announced March 2 that it proposed paying more
than $33 a share in cash for all of AFG's common stock, subject to
a review of AFG's internal corporate information and meeting with
AFG management.
   On Thursday, Forstmann Little said it had completed the review,
that AFG had promptly furnished requested confidential information
and that AFG management had cooperated fully in the review.
   ``Based on this review and Forstmann Little's adherence to
strict acquisition criteria, it has determined that it will not
make an offer to acquire AFG,'' the New York-based leveraged buyout
specialist said.
   The firm declined to elaborate.
   AFG announced Feb. 25 that it had agreed to a buyout by a new
company headed by Hubbard that would pay $33 a share in cash for 94
percent of AFG's common stock and $33 per share in preferred stock
or a combination of cash and stock for the rest of the shares.
   AFG has 28.5 million common shares outstanding.
   AFG is one of the leading manufacturers of window glass and has
a range of specialty glass products.
   Hubbard's offer is being made by Hubbard's Clarity Industries
Corp., which is offering to buy up to 26.8 million AFG common
shares.
   Meantime, Clarity said two AFG shareholders had filed
class-action complaints in Delaware seeking to block its tender
offer.
   Clarity said the shareholders alleged the agreement between
Clarity and AFG to take the company private constitutes
self-dealing, deception and unfair dealing and breaches the
fiduciary duties owed AFG shareholders.

<HEAD>Sugarman Boosts Media General Stake, Seeks to Force Vote on
Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An impending battle for Media
General Inc. is heating up, with television producer Burt Sugarman
boosting his stake in the company and signaling a fight to force a
shareholder vote on his $1.75 billion buyout bid.
   Sugarman said Thursday that two companies he controls boosted
their stake in Media General, the Virginia-based broadcasting and
publishing corporation to 10 percent from 9.8 percent.
   Sugarman also repeated his contention that Media General's board
of directors was legally bound to put his buyout plan to a
shareholder vote.
   However, Media General disputed Sugarman's contentions on how
the company's two classifications of stock would be allowed to vote
on a merger.
   Media General has 28 million shares of Class A common stock
entitled to one vote each and 559,168 Class B shares that have
disproportionate voting rights and elect seven of the company's 10
directors.
   The family of Media General's chairman, D. Tennant Bryan, owns
71 percent of the company's Class B stock.
   Shortly after Sugarman made his $61.50-per-share takeover offer
late last month, the Bryan family said it wasn't interested in
selling the company.
   In a letter sent Thursday to Media General's president and chief
executive officer, James S. Evans, Sugarman contended that under
Media General's charter all shareholders should have equal voting
rights in deciding on a proposed acquisition of the company by
someone holding at least 10 percent of its stock.
   In all other cases, the Class B stock would retain its special
voting rights, Sugarman contended.
   Sugarman reiterated that if Media General directors failed to
put the proposed merger before shareholders, they ``will be
breaching their fiduciary duty.''
   Media General disputed Sugarman's claims, saying ``company
counsel found Sugarman's legal reasoning incorrect.''
   Media General said that under its charter any merger would
require the vote of two-thirds of each class of stock. In addition
to the charter requirement, the company said, Virginia law requires
that a merger be approved by more than two-thirds of the Class B
stock.
   Media General owns a number of daily papers, including the
Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch and News Leader, the Winston-Salem
(N.C.) Journal and the Tampa (Fla.) Tribune, plus 32 weeklie in
Southern California and a 40 percent interest in Garden State
Newspapers Inc., which owns 18 dailies and four weeklies in eight
states. It also owns television stations, including WCBD-TV in
Charleston, S.C., WJKS-TV in Jacksonville, Fla., and WXFL-TV in
Tampa, Fla.
   Sugarman is making his takeover bid through two companies he
controls _ Barris Industries Inc., the creator of TV programs such
as ``The Dating Game,'' ``The Newlywed Game'' and ``The Gong
Show,'' and Giant Group Ltd., the parent of Keystone Cement Co. and
Giant Cement Co. with units in Pennsylvania and South Carolina.

<HEAD>Seagram-Tropicana Deal A Tasty Mix, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Take one liquor company, add one orange juice
company, and the resulting mix could be a satisfying corporate
cocktail _ at least that's how some industry experts characterized
Seagram Co. Ltd.'s plans to buy Tropicana Products Inc.
   The $1.2 billion deal announced Thursday will expand Seagram's
share of the beverage market and could result in a wider line of
Tropicana products, said Robert S. Reitzes, who follows Seagram for
the investment firm Mabon, Nugent & Co. in New York.
   ``It's a good fit,'' Reitzes said ``It makes sense in their
business.''
   The Canadian liquor-and-beverage giant's acquisition of
Tropicana from Beatrice U.S. Food Corp. marks a diversification and
expansion of Seagram's product lines, Seagram Chairman Edgar M.
Bronfman stated in announcing the deal.
   ``We have already broadened our base with Seagram's (wine)
coolers, and Tropicana is another step in this direction,''
Bronfman said.
   Analysts said the move into the juice business was a logical
step for Seagram, which faced limited growth potential from its
liquor business.
   ``They understand the business, and it's growing unlike most of
their liquor products,'' said Ian Osler, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Toronto.
   Seagram will finance the acquisition _ to be made through the
company's U.S. subsidiary, Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc. _
initially with a combination of bank loans and short-term
borrowings, Seagram said.
   Montreal-based Seagram, best known for its distilled spirits and
wines, in recent years moved into production of wine coolers and
the sale of mixers such as tonic and ginger ale under the Seagram
name.
   Seagram also is in the process of acquiring French cognac
producer Martell & Co. in a deal valued at $930 million. It also
owns a 23 percent stake in Du Pont Co.
   Tropicana, headquartered in Bradenton, Fla., is a leading
manufacturer and distributor of ready-to-serve orange juice and
frozen concentrate. It had sales of about $750 million in its last
fiscal year, which ended Feb. 29, said Marcelline Thomson, a
Seagram spokeswoman in New York.
   Seagram had net income of nearly $423.5 billion on sales of $3.3
billion in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 1987. It reported a
profit of more than $402.4 million on sales of $2.6 billion for the
nine months ended Oct. 31.
   Chicago-based Beatrice U.S. Food Corp. is a division of
closely-held Beatrice Co., which put itself up for sale last
September. The company also is considering the sale of its
Hunt-Wesson operations, which produce vegetable oils, ketchup and
La Choy brand Chinese food.
   Beatrice Co.'s predecessor, Beatrice Cos., was taken private in
1986 in a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. Since then it has sold most of its major assets,
including Avis car rental, International Playtex Inc. and its
international foods business.
   A number of Beatrice's consumer products businesses were spun
off as E-II Holdings Inc., which last month agreed to be acquired
by American Brands Inc. after making a brief takeover move against
the company.
   Beatrice Chairman Donald Kelly, who also is chairman of E-II,
had hoped to sell Beatrice whole but could not find a buyer at his
asking price, reportedly $4.5 billion.

   The credo of Banana Republic's new travel
magazine is simple _ people shouldn't travel halfway around the
world only to find the same hamburger joints they've got back home.
   ``We are on the brink of becoming McGlobe,'' warns Mel Ziegler,
president of the San Francisco-based clothier and editor-in-chief
of Trips, a quarterly launched nationwide this week.
   Ziegler says 300,000 customers already have expressed interest
in $10-a-year subscriptions to the magazine, which promises to
``lead you down the back alleys of Cairo, onto forbidden islands or
through your own hometown, in search of stories that will transcend
the distinctions between traveler and fantasist...''
   ``We wanted to publish the world's first honest travel
magazine,'' he said in a recent interview. ``If you read most
travel magazines, you get the idea travel is painless, nothing ever
goes wrong. We all know nobody ever takes a trip like that.''
   Trips, which takes an iconoclastic approach to globe-trotting,
is aimed at the same affluent urbanites who made such a success of
the 10-year-old adventure-wear company, which was sold to The Gap
clothing chain for an undisclosed sum in 1983.
   It also attempts to latch onto a recent boom in travel magazines
that has seen a handful of new publications in recent months.
   The inaugural issue is a trek into the offbeat and bizarre.
   Articles include a journey through the apartheid world of South
Africa, bicycling with the 400-pound king of Tonga in the South
Pacific and sneaking onto a secret Hawaiian island.
   An interview with Rod Nordland, a correspondent-at-large for
Newsweek magazine, is billed as ``a palm-greasing primer'' on the
art of baksheesh, the Arabic word for petty bribery.
   But the advice doesn't just center on money: the article advises
that a pack of cigarettes may convince a taxi driver in Angola to
get you to the airport and a bottle of liquor or contact points for
a '57 Chevy can get you just about anything in Burma.
   Also included is a section where world-weary travelers pass on
tips to surviving off the beaten path.
   These include suggestions to carry a golf ball in your luggage,
because many of the world's hotels don't have drain plugs, and to
carry a roll of toilet paper not only for obvious uses but also for
insulating boots, wrapping wounds, and serving as barter.
   Trips is entering a rapidly expanding market. In 1986, the most
recent year for which figures are available, Americans spent $257
billion on domestic travel and $24.5 billion overseas, according to
The New York Times.
   As a result, travel magazines are enjoying a renaissance. The
Newhouse media conglomerate in September began publishing Conde
Nast's Traveler which, like Trips, promises not to whitewash
getaway spots. Fairchild Publications' Travel Today, a weekly
tabloid, hit newsstands in January.
   Ziegler says many Americans he meets traveling these days are
not on ``tour packages seeing foreign ports from a bubble, nor are
they backpackers....
   ``These are working people who have saved some money who like to
enjoy cultures fully by immersing themselves in it.''

<HEAD>Northwest Attendants' Union Calls Contract To Be Imposed
`Unacceptable'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing 6,700 Northwest
Airlines flight attendants is warning travelers about the
possibility of a strike during the busy spring break.
   ``As the travel increases over spring break and Easter, it is to
our advantage to keep ready for a strike,'' Dennis Quinn, the
Teamsters' national strike coordinator, told a news conference
Thursday.
   However, he added, ``We have not set a firm strike deadline at
this time.''
   Quinn's comments came as the union termed unacceptable the
contract which Northwest plans to impose April 1.
   The Minneapolis airline has been free to impose the contract
since a Feb. 26 strike deadline passed and the union has been free
to strike.
   Terry Erskine, Northwest's vice president of law and labor
relations, said he would not rule out making changes in the
contract before April 1 if the union comes forward with suggestions.
   But Quinn said, ``Northwest intends to force a strike. It is
moving into a situation where there are no other alternatives but a
work stoppage, and that it is a very good reason for you to
indicate, yes, we are serious.''
   Northwest spokesman Redmond Tyler denounced the Teamster
announcement as ``rhetoric'' and said spring travelers would
encounter no problems even in the event of a strike.
   ``Continue to plan your travel because we anticipate no
disruption in service,'' Tyler said. ``We regret any attempt to
intimidate ... We are disappointed our employees would take this
tactic to confuse their company's customers.''
   Meanwhile, a taped message on a Teamsters hotline for flight
attendants criticized the contract and said the company's move did
not end the union's right to strike.
   ``Northwest assumes you will accept this substandard contract.
Please show them how wrong they are,'' Dottie Malinsky, president
of Teamsters Local 2747, which represents the Minneapolis unit,
told attendants on the taped message.
   ``This company action will backfire on them. Nickel and diming
the employees is not going to change the bad management at
Northwest,'' she said.
   Teamsters have called a strategy meeting Monday in Washington,
D.C., for local union officers and strike captains at Northwest.
Leaders of the unions representing Northwest ground workers and
pilots are expected to attend that meeting, Malinsky said.
   Claudia Bushbaum, secretary-treasurer for Teamsters Local 2747,
said the airline's offer to negotiate on the contract was
meaningless. Northwest is unwilling to bend on the issue of when to
elevate lower-paid employees, who are on what the company and union
call a B pay scale, to higher pay scales, she said.
   ``If the company does not come back to the table and negotiate
and move off of their position of the extended B pay scale, there
is all likelihood we will strike when the time is right,'' Bushbaum
said. ``They're willing to sit across the table from you and say
they're going to negotiate, but sitting across the table from you
and saying `no' is not negotiations. And that is exactly the way
Northwest negotiates when we talk about the B pay scale.''
   Under the new contract, Northwest says union membership would no
longer be a condition of employment. Bushbaum, who called that a
``union-busting tactic,'' said Teamsters' attorneys were reviewing
the legality of this action.
   Erskine said Wednesday that if attendants decide to strike now,
the airline is prepared to hire permanent replacements.

   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin today said a
proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $5.05 an hour over
the next four years may sound ``like the right thing to do'' but it
actually would cause a loss of jobs.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said the proposed increase, likely to be
approved next week by the House Education and Labor Committee,
would be particularly hard on young people with no skills who are
seeking their first jobs.
   ``This is a tough one. $5.05 an hour, I'm afraid would make
almost any economist have some jitters,'' Mrs. McLaughlin said in
an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``The body of economic
thinking is that the increase in the minimum wage, while
well-intentioned and it sounds like the right thing to do, actually
will cause a loss of jobs, particularly impacting on young people
who need to get into the workforce.''
   Education and Labor Committee Chairman Augustus F. Hawkins,
D-Calif., scheduled a session next Wednesday for final action on
the minimum wage bill. The panel had been unable on Thursday to
address all the amendments to a proposal that was approved by the
House labor standards subcommittee a week ago.
   The subcommittee approved an increase from $3.35 to $4.65 an
hour over a three-year period, with a 50-cent raise in 1989 and a
40-cent jump in both 1990 and 1991.
   During the full committee's hearing, Rep. Carl C. Perkins,
D-Ky., proposed an amendment for an increase of another 40 cents in
1992 in an effort to keep the federal minimum at approximately one
half of the nation's average wage.
   The committee approved the Perkins amendment on a vote of 18-14
with only two Democrats, Reps. Austin J. Murphy of Pennsylvania and
Timothy J. Penny of Minnesota, joining Republicans in opposing the
proposal.
   Murphy, chairman of the labor standards subcommittee, said his
panel had fashioned a measure which would be acceptable to the full
House and the Senate and possibly the White House.
   ``We don't know what impact the fourth year will have on the
loss of jobs,'' Murphy said.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., however, read from a letter
written to Hawkins by Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin who said
senior White House advisers would recommend to President Reagan
that he veto any legislation increasing the minimum wage.
   ``It doesn't matter what we do; the executive will be against
it,'' he said.
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Tex., who opposes any increase, proposed an
amendment to the Perkins measure to raise the base to $20 an hour,
but withdrew it after Hawkins called it absurd.
   The committee approved 20-13 an amendment by Rep. Tommy F.
Robinson, D-Ark., to increase the ``tip credit'' for restaurant
employers.
   Current law allows employers of workers who regularly receive
tips _ such as waiters and waitresses _ to count the tips as earned
wages equivalent to 40 percent of the minimum wage.
   Thus, a restaurant owner could pay a worker $2.01 an hour, with
the remaining $1.34 _ 40 percent of today's $3.35-an-hour minimum
wage _ supposed to come from tips.
   The Robinson proposal would increase the credit to 50 percent.
   The Senate has a companion bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Human Resources
Committee, which raises the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour over a
three-year period.

   Retail sales, boosted by strength in autos,
rose 0.6 percent in February, following a January decline, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that retail sales rose a seasonally
adjusted $714 million to $127.99 billion last month.
   While the February increase was generally in line with
expectations, the government revised the January report to show a
small decline of 0.2 percent, instead of an originally reported
increase of 0.5 percent.
   Even with the January decline, analysts said the retail sales
report generally reflected that the October stock market crash has
had little effect on consumer buying plans.
   Ever since the record 508-point drop in stock prices which
occurred on Oct. 19, economists have been closely watching to see
whether the consumer sector would weaken.
   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, any significant faltering in this area could
topple the country into a recession.
   Continued strong gains in employment growth have apparently
calmed initial jitters over the stock market. Many economists have
recently revised up their growth forecasts for 1988.
   The February report said that retail sales rose to the highest
monthly total since August 1987.
   Much of the strength came from a 1.6 percent rise in auto sales,
which followed an even stronger 2 percent increase in new car sales
in January.
   Without the gain in autos, which accounted for almost one-fourth
of total sales last month, retail sales would have risen a smaller
0.3 percent in February.
   The important general merchandise category, which includes
department store sales, suffered a 1.6 percent decline in sales in
February following a small 0.1 percent drop in January sales.
   Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, were up 1.6 percent in February while sales of non-durable
goods edged down 0.1 percent.
   In the durable goods category, sales at building materials and
hardware stores jumped a sharp 2.3 percent.
   Sales at furniture and appliance stores were up 0.3 percent in
February following an even stronger 2.7 percent January increase.
   Sales at specialty clothing stores climbed 0.6 percent in
February, only a partial rebound following a giant 3.3 percent
January decline.
   Sales at gasoline stations fell 1.6 percent in February while
sales at restaurants edged up 0.1 percent and sales at drug stores
posted a 0.6 percent increase.
   Sales at grocery stores enjoyed a 0.7 percent rise in sales in
February, reversing a 0.6 percent January decline.

<HEAD>Colt Industries To Be Taken Private In Leveraged Buyout</HEAD>

options and expenses, and total outstanding shares.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colt Industries Inc., a major defense contractor
and industrial concern, has agreed to be taken private in a $660
million leveraged buyout led by senior management and the
investment firm Morgan Stanley Group Inc.
   The board of Colt, whose name may be best known from its
firearms business, approved an offer of $17 a share for all of its
approximately 31.65 million common shares outstanding late
Wednesday and announced the plan on Thursday. The price of Colt
stock options and expenses was included in the total price of the
buyout.
   The offer was subject to several conditions, including a
majority of the shares being tendered.
   Colt shares surged $4.87{ to $18.12{ on the New York Stock
Exchange on Thursday, indicating some speculators believed an offer
higher than the group's $17 a share bid would emerge.
   Under the transaction, Colt would become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Colt Holdings Inc., a new company formed by the
management team and Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, Colt
stated. About $1.4 billion of Colt debt would remain outstanding,
it said.
   The Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II is a limited
partnership that invests in leveraged buyouts, or deals in which a
company is acquired largely with borrowed funds repaid through the
target company's profits or sale of its assets.
   Colt said Morgan Stanley and its equity fund unit have agreed to
provide $460 million in short-term bridge financing for Colt
Holdings, which would be repaid through a public or private
offering of long-term debt.
   Investors in Colt Holdings would put up another $200 million,
Colt said.
   Colt Chairman David I. Margolis said the merger agreement would
give Colt ``the opportunity to establish and implement a more
aggressive business program, including acquisition, than we could
have undertaken alone.''
   Colt is a leading supplier of aerospace, automotive and
industrial products. It employs about 22,000 people.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait said Friday that it has raised its stake in
British Petroleum Co. PLC to 21.25 percent, breaching the level BP
has said was acceptable.
   The Kuwait Investment Office, an agency set up for the purpose
of BP investments, said it intended to push the stake to 22.5
percent when market conditions permit. The group said it now holds
1.269 billion BP shares.
   BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said last month that 20 percent
was an acceptable holding.
   BP has declined to comment on the Kuwaiti group's latest
disclosure.
   In February the KIO declared a 19.53 percent stake, or 1.165
billion shares.
   Analysts say BP and the British government have failed to obtain
Kuwaiti assurances that it will stop buying the shares.
   ``I think BP will be very unhappy about the increased stake,''
said Chris Grudniewicz, an analyst at Smith New Court Research.
``BP will probably now try to get the British government to lean on
the Kuwaitis to get some assurance they'll stop buying.''
   Recent heavy turnover in BP new shares had already raised
speculation that the KIO was building on its stake in BP.

   The London stock market remained largely depressed

   At 2 p.m. local time, the Financial Times Index of 100 leading
shares hit the low for the day of 1814.4 points, down 20.2.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 23.1 points at

closed off 48.24 points at 2,026.03.
   Oil stocks, however, proved an exception with heavy trading
continuing in British Petroleum shares. Total trading in the
company amounted to more than a quarter of total stock exchange
volume.
   The Kuwait Investment Office confirmed Friday it raised its
stake in the company to 21.25 percent, or 1.269 billion shares. The
new stake broke the 20 percent ceiling British Petroleum had viewed
as an acceptable holding for the Kuwait office.

   Manufacturers Hanover Corp., the nation's
sixth-largest bank holding company, says it expects to net at least
$807 million this year, and that the number would be much higher if
Brazil resumes payments on its debt.
   Brazil is negotiating terms of an agreement to restart those
payments, which it suspended last year. Should that happen,
Manufacturers Hanover's net earnings ``would kick up by another
$150 million after tax,'' James Hambleton, a senior vice president
of the bank, said today.
   In its annual report released Thursday, the bank said it will
pick up about $230 million from the sale of ``undervalued assets''
in 1988.
   Operating earnings should total at least $377 million, including
$95 million after a restructuring announced earlier this year,
according to figures contained in the report.
   In addition, it said it planned to apply about $200 million of
tax benefits to its 1988 balance sheet. The benefits come from $342
million in tax benefits remaining from the $1.7 billion addition to
loan-loss reserves last year.
   The huge loan-loss provision, which was made to cover shaky
Third World debt, was largely responsible for a $1.14 billion loss
in 1987. Several other major banks also suffered losses or
decreased earnings due to the foreign debt crisis.
   Manufacturers Hanover said that as a result of the sale of
``undervalued assets,'' which it did not name, and the tax
benefits, it expected to improve shareholders' equity.
   Shareholders' equity is a corporation's net worth after
subtracting all liabilities.
   ``Restoring common shareholders' equity to 4 percent, the ratio
prior to the reserving action, is our overriding priority,'' the
company said.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.49 to 2,024.54

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Geological Survey has lowered its
estimates of undiscovered onshore oil and gas in the United States
by about 40 percent, but industry spokesmen question the data.
   The American Gas Association says the government is not counting
all the different potential reservoirs, and the American Petroleum
Institute says the new numbers for oil are just another in a long
line of underestimates.
   Terry Uhl, the gas association's spokesman, calls it
``misinformation and disinformation'' to say onshore undiscovered
reserves amount to 254 trillion cubic feet, down from 427 trillion
cubic feet.
   The association uses the estimate of 400 trillion cubic feet
from the Potential Gas Committee, an industry panel operated by the
Colorado School of Mines.
   Ozzie Girard, the geological survey's deputy assistant director
for engineering geology, said Thursday he doubted there was much
difference between the survey and the gas committee estimates once
adjustments for comparability are made.
   The survey has not counted gas in certain shales, tight sands or
reservoirs of less than 5 billion cubic feet, all of which are
counted by the committee. Hard-to-exploit tight sands formations
probably hold 100 trillion cubic feet, Girard said.
   No such adjustments can account for the change in estimates of
undiscovered onshore oil.
   The survey said undiscovered oil likely is between 19.6 billion
barrels and 51.9 billion barrels, with the best estimate at 33.4
billion barrels. The range in 1981 was 41.7 billion barrels to 71
billion barrels, with the best estimate at 54.6 billion barrels.
   In 1981, the survey relied heavily on the judgment of expert
geologists. In the last two reports, the survey has been able to
use detailed drilling data from the entire country, Girard said.
   Charles DiBona, president of the petroleum institute, said the
nation has produced three times the oil estimated by a presidential
commission in 1952 in the category of oil remaining to be
discovered.
   ``You never know until you drill,'' DiBona said.
   Most of the change, Girard said, resulted from drilling
disappointments. In 1981, there had been major new finds in the
overthrust belt east of the Rockies, and government geologists
thought ``the sky was the limit.'' But drilling failures since then
have reduced expectations.
   Also, some pools of oil have moved from the ``undiscovered'' to
the ``discovered'' category.
   Also, the price has fallen sharply. The 1981 study used $30 a
barrel. The new study assumes a price of $18 a barrel. ``Certainly
there was some effect'' from the lower price, said Girard, but he
could not quantify it.
   This could mean lower estimates for offshore oil, which the
Minerals Management Service, sister agency in the Interior
Department to the Geological Survey, estimated in 1985 at 12.2
billion barrels, down from 27 billion barrels in 1981.
   Tom DeRocco, spokesman for the service, said new offshore
estimates expected next month were made on the assumption that oil
costs $18 a barrel. The 1985 estimates assumed $29 a barrel.
   He declined to say what the new estimates would be, but did say,
``There's no question economics has a lot to do with this.''
   A higher price for oil makes pools with more expensive
production costs profitable to drill.

<HEAD>UTC Top Executive Earns More Than $1 Million In 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp., which
undertook cost-cutting efforts last year, paid its top executive
compensation totalling more than $1 million in 1987, a 27.9 percent
increase over the previous year.
   Robert F. Daniell, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, for the Hartford-based conglomerate received a salary of
$637,500, incentive compensation of $450,000 and $16,393 for
professional fees, physical examinations, leased automobiles and
leased aircraft, according to a UTC proxy statement released
Thursday.
   The total compensation amounted to $1,087,500 in 1987, according
to the proxy issued in advance of the company's annual meeting
April 18 at the Hartford Civic Center.
   In the past year, UTC has sold some operations, laid off workers
and made management changes in a bid to become more competitive and
cut costs.
   In 1986, Daniell received a salary of $600,000 and incentive
compensation totalling $250,000. His fringe benefits that year
totalled $29,942, boosting his total compensation to $879,942.
   Edward J. Large, executive vice president for corporate
development, was the second-highest compensated employee. He
received $645,000, up 8.9 precent from the $593,125 received in
1986.
   Danielle and Large were the only two executives to be among the
top five compensated UTC employees in 1986 and 1987. Disclosure of

   Oil prices may be headed higher again, after
months of declines amid swelling inventories and lackluster demand.
   Analysts say prospects of good summer demand and indications
that major producers might take action to help curb the recent
slide should help boost prices in coming months.
   Unconfirmed reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries was studying a plan to shave 850,000 barrels from its
daily production sent futures contracts soaring on Thursday, and
that rally continued today.
   Near midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for
April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.
crude, stood at $16.19 per 42-gallon barrel, up 19 cents from
Thursday, when the price closed up 51 cents at $16.00.
   Refined products also built on Thursday's strong advance.
Wholesale heating oil, up 0.90 cent Thursday, stood at 44.44 cents
per gallon, up another 0.51 cent. Wholesale unleaded gasoline stood
at 45.55 cents per gallon, up 0.41 cent after leaping 1.14 cents
per gallon to close at 45.14 cents Thursday.
   James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc. Commodities, said traders
were encouraged by reports that OPEC was considering cutbacks, even
though cartel officials later denied that the purported idea of 5
percent output cuts for all 13 members except Iraq was getting
serious consideration.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also indicated
that its pricing committee was unlikely to meet soon, despite calls
by member Venezuela for a meeting.
   But Steel said futures traders pushed prices higher because the
reports suggested the cartel was at least taking some action to
deal with the declines before they started getting out of hand.
   In the Persian Gulf, for example, crude recently has been
selling at levels between $13 and $14 per barrel _ far below OPEC's
$18-per-barrel target _ while in the United States, West Texas
Intermediate has been bouncing in the $15-to-$16 range after
selling near $18 in January.
   Analysts have blamed the slump on sluggish worldwide demand and
swelling inventories, worsened by an unusually warm winter in
Europe.
   Some OPEC members, desperate to preserve their market shares,
have aggravated the decline by discounting prices to lure customers
away from OPEC competitors and ``NOPEC'' countries, such as Mexico,
Britain, Norway and a host of other smaller nations.
   Dillard Spriggs, president of the Petroleum Analysis Ltd.
consulting firm, said crude prices could fall another dollar in two
weeks if world production does not slow down quickly.
   In a worst-case scenario, buyers might then disappear to wait
for even lower prices, heightening downward price pressure.
   ``But chances are probably pretty good they'll rein it in,''
Spriggs said, citing prospects for increased summer demand. ``I
think we're in this cycle of up-and-down that will go on until
about 1990.''
   Analysts said OPEC's problem was that the production quotas the
cartel set at its December meeting simply were too high.
   Since December, OPEC's official aggregate quota has stood at
17.5 million barrels a day. Spriggs said the cartel would have to
cut production to about 16.8 million barrels daily to match demand
and bring prices back to its $18-per-barrel target.
   As a result, cartel members had to discount the extra barrels to
sell them, said Ed Krapels, of the Washington-based Energy Security
Analysis Inc. consulting firm.
   Still, Krapels said, ``the worst is over,'' because demand
should pick up during the summer driving season.
   ``We expect the situation to be a little easier for OPEC to
handle in the next three months than in the last three,'' he said.
   At the Oppenheimer & Co. securities firm, oil analyst Paul Ting
said he also believed oil prices will head higher, continuing in a
cycle of ``strengths and weakness.''
   OPEC is all too aware of the billions of dollars of income it
lost by casting off production constraints in 1986, he said.
   ``Back in 1985, nobody in his right mind would have thought oil
could drop below $18 a barrel. They got quite a surprise when it
got down to $8. I think they're not likely to repeat that again,''
Ting said.
   ``I think they're going to get their acts together (because)
they really can't live at prices significantly below $18 for a long
time,'' he said.

   The stock market lost more ground today,
extending Thursday's sharp decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 48.24 points on
Thursday, dropped 3.65 to 2,022.38 by 11 a.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 604 up, 693 down and
506 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 93.71 million shares at
midmorning.
   A big chunk of that activity came in the stock of MFS
Intermediate Income Trust, which traded at 10 after a 200
million-share initial offering at that price.
   The debut of the closed-end investment company specializing in
interest-bearing securities of 10 years or less marked the largest
initial public stock offering ever in the U.S. market.
   Otherwise, analysts said traders were a bit unnerved by
Thursday's drop, which was the largest in more than two months.
   Stocks drew some support, however from falling interest rates in
the credit markets, where prices of long-term Treasury bonds rose
as much as $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   The bond market got a lift from news of an unexpected 0.2
percent decline in the producer price index last month and a
relatively modest 0.6 percent rise in retail sales for the same
period.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric dropped \ to
42}; American Express { to 26|; International Business Machines [
to 113|, and Dow Chemical 1\ to 85].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.08 to 148.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .27 at 295.73.

<HEAD>Closed-End Bond Funds Hot In A Cool Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the market for new stocks has turned
chilly since Black Monday last Oct. 19, Wall Street has found
strong demand for one category of new issue _ closed-end bond funds.
   In the first two months of 1988, Standard & Poor's reports,
investors snapped up more than $3.5 billion in shares of these
investments.
   On Friday, Massachusetts Financial Services of Boston added $2
billion more to the total with the debut of its MFS Intermediate
Income Trust, in what stands as the largest initial public stock
offering ever.
   The attraction of these funds is not the hope of spectacular
growth or quick trading profits, but rather yields as high as the
10 percent to 11{ percent range.
   There is no denying the appeal of such returns, especially in a
period when interest rates have been generally declining, pushing
the yield available on long-term government bonds below 8.5 percent.
   But some analysts wonder whether all the eager buyers look
beyond the yield to gain a full understanding of this particular
breed of security and how it has often behaved in the past.
   A closed-end fund operates very much like a mutual fund, with
one very important difference.
   Mutual funds stand continuously ready to sell new shares and
redeem old ones, at a price that is determined by the net asset
value of their portfolios on any given day.
   Shares of closed-end funds, by contrast, are traded like any
other stock on an exchange or in the over-the-counter market.
   The number of shares remains fixed, except for special occasions
on which the fund might decide to increase it with a new offering
or reduce it by buying in some of its stock.
   So while the operating performance of a mutual fund is the sole
determinant of its price, a closed-end fund's price is also
influenced by supply and demand forces in the open market.
   Its shares can trade at a premium above net asset value, or a
discount below net asset value.
   ``During periods of strength in fixed-income markets, such as at
present, some bond funds may temporarily sell at a premium to
NAV,'' Standard & Poor's analysts observe in the firm's weekly
publication The Outlook.
   ``If history is any guide, however, the premiums tend to shrink
and give way to discounts once interest rates begin to rise.''
   Closed-end funds of all types have enjoyed a revival of interest
in the past few years. Fund managers say they like the format
because it allows them to pursue their investment strategies
undisturbed by the ebb and flow of money that can occur in mutual
funds.
   In theory at least, a popular mutual fund may have to make
bigger or riskier bets than it would like when money pours into its
coffers. Conversely, it may have to sell securities it would rather
keep when redemptions increase.
   The recent evidence lends some support to this view. S&P quotes
statistics from Lipper Analytical Services showing an average total
return of 85 percent over the last five years for closed-end bond
funds.
   In the same period, a comparable group of fixed-income mutual
funds averaged a total return of 72 percent.
   Nevertheless, veteran observers of closed-end funds say, when
you are approached by a broker recommending a new fund, it makes
sense to look at the similar alternatives that may be available in
existing funds.
   Says S&P: ``Consider acquiring a closed-end fund in the
after-market, when premiums often shrink after a few months and you
need pay only a normal brokerage commission and not a built-in
initial underwriting fee of about 7 percent.''

<HEAD>Campeau Gets More Financing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. says it has moved closer to
completing the financing for its $6.18 billion tender offer for
Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Campeau is fighting a competing $6.1 billion offer by R.H. Macy
& Co. Inc. to buy Federated, the nation's fifth-largest retailing
company. Seeking support for its bid, Campeau has announced each
step in its efforts to win financing as they have been reached.
   Campeau said Thursday that Citibank of New York and the New York
branch of Sumitomo of Japan have agreed to provide $1.5 billion of
a $2.66 billion secured loan that would be used in connection with
purchase of Federated shares.
   The Toronto-based retailer said in a statement the two banks
were confident the remaining $1.16 billion needed for the loan
could be obtained through a syndicate of banks.
   Campeau also said Citibank would provide $1 billion and Sumitomo
$500 million of $3.13 billion in long term financing for the
Federated acquisition after the tender offer.
   Campeau has offered to pay $75 a share in cash for 80 percent of
Federated's stock and $44 a share in cash for the remaining 20
percent.
   The Macy proposal, which is backed by Federated management and
the company's board of directors, would pay $74.50 a share in cash
for 80 percent of Federated's shares and stock in the merged
company, Macy's-Federated Inc., for the remaining 20 percent.
   Campeau earlier announced $1.5 billion in bridge financing from
First Boston Corp., its financial adviser, and $1.4 billion in
equity to put into the Federated acquisition.
   The equity includes a $480 million loan from Youngstown
developer Edward J. DeBartolo, $500 million in secured bank loans,
$260 million in debentures from Olympia & York Developments Ltd.,
and a portion of the $770 million Campeau expects to realize from
the proposed sale of the Brooks Brothers division of its Allied
Stores Corp.
   Besides the $3.13 billion in bank financing, Campeau has agreed
to sell Federated's Filene's stores in Boston and Foley's in
Houston to St. Louis-based May Department Stores Inc. for between
$1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in cash and notes.
   Campeau and Macy have both indicated they would sell Federated's
non-department store holdings, which include Ralphs supermarkets,
Gold Circle discount stores and Children's Place and Main Street
specialty retailers.
   In a filing this week with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Macy indicated $2.9 billion in Federated assets would
be sold if its bid is successful. Macy said the non-department
store divisions would be put up for sale as well as ``certain other
assets.''
   Analysts believe Macy would sell two department store divisions,
Abraham & Straus and Rich's, which directly compete with Macy
Stores.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in the absence of strong
market-affecting factors.
   Wheat futures opened slightly higher in an early attempt to
rebound from four weeks of falling prices, analysts said.
   ``Wheat's been plunging here for 20-some sessions and the
market's getting way oversold on a strictly technical basis,'' said
Walter Spilka, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in
New York.
   Soybean futures were mixed with the nearby March contract
slightly lower, reflecting the market's continuing fear of a large
South American soybean harvest, Spilka said.
   Corn was slightly lower while oats were sharply higher in a
reversal from Thursday's losses.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $2.91 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to } cent lower with March at $1.97 a bushel; oats were \
cent lower to 6\ cents higher with March at $1.87{ a bushel;
soybeans were } cent lower to 1{ cents higher with March at $6.03 a

   Livestock futures were mostly higher while pork belly futures
were lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .45 cent higher with April at 73.37
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .50 cent higher with
March at 82.05 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with April at 43.37 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.10 cent to .17 cent lower with March at 51.55 cents a pound.
   Live cattle futures closed higher on Thursday but other
livestock and meat futures ended mostly lower.

<TEXT>
   Union meatpackers say they will appeal a
federal court verdict that found illegal a six-month strike outside
John Morrell & Co.'s Sioux Falls plant last year which erupted in
violence several times.
   A jury in a $40 million lawsuit brought by the company against
Local 304A of the United Food and Commercial Workers ruled Thursday
that union members' refusal to cross a picket line set up by
members of another local was a violation of their contract.
   A new jury will be picked this summer or fall to decide the
amount of damages, if any, that are due Morrell.
   Union officials are confident they will win on appeal, Allen
Zack, a spokesman in Washington.
   The jury had been asked to determine whether a May 1 walkout at
the Sioux Falls plant was a sympathy strike and whether the current
contract allowed the strike.
   About 2,500 Local 304A members in Sioux Falls refused to cross a
picket line set up May 1 by striking Morrell workers from Sioux
City, Iowa.
   The strike led to rock-throwing, vandalism and other incidents
of picket-line violence during its early days. A state judge issued
an injunction against the union because of the violence.
   The company argued that the work stoppage was a primary, or
economic strike and not a sympathy strike and that the strikers
broke their contract because they were concerned about possible
wage cuts.
   The jury agreed with the union's contention that the work
stoppage was a sympathy strike. But it agreed with the company's
position that all strikes are illegal under Morrell's contract with
Local 304A.
   Union leaders testified that the no-strike clause in the
contract prohibited Sioux Falls workers from striking over issues
in their contract but that the May 1 strike was not over the Sioux
Falls pact.
   Morrell hired replacement workers at both its Sioux Falls and
Sioux City plants.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Battey of Rapid City presided.

<HEAD>Former Banker Released on Bail in Guinness Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former merchant banker Lord Patrick Spens was
freed on $920,000 bail raised by two friends after appearing in
court Friday to hear charges related to the Guinness financial
scandal.
   Spens, a former managing director of merchant bankers Henry
Ansbacher and Co. Ltd, was arrested and charged Thursday for his
alleged role in one of Britain's largest financial scandals.
   He was ordered to appear in court again April 12 along with four
others charged so far in the affair, surrender his passport to
police and not to contact employees from the Ansbacher group.
   Two business friends _ Alan Lewis, the chairman of a textiles
company, and Charles Longbottom, former chairman of an Ansbacher
subsidiary _ paid Spens' bail, the British domestic news agency
Press Association reported.
   Police are investigating Guinness' tactics during its $4 billion
1986 takeover of Distillers Co. PLC, a Scotch whisky and gin maker,
in what was then Britain's biggest acquisition ever.
   Spens, 45, resigned from Henry Ansbacher in January 1987 under
pressure from the Bank of England, and told reporters his alleged
role in the Guinness affair was perceived as an error of judgment.
   He was subsequently charged in two counts with involvement in
the improper payment of an interest-free loan of $14 million from
Guinness to Ansbachers to fund the buying of more than 2 million
shares in the brewing giant.
   Two other counts allege falsification of a document for
Ansbachers and conspiracy to create a false or misleading
impression of the market value of Guinness shares.
   Guinness has admitted arranging the allegedly illegal repurchase
of its stock in an apparent effort to boost the price and make its
cash and stock offer for Distillers more attractive than a rival
bid from Argyll Group PLC, a supermarket operator.

   Koppers Co. Friday sued Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. and British investor Brian Beazer, accusing them of violating
securities laws in trying to acquire the Pittsburgh-based chemicals
and construction company.
   Koppers said it was attempting to break up ``an ongoing illegal
scheme ... to acquire control of Koppers in blatant violation of
the disclosure requirements'' of securities laws.
   Koppers asked the court to block the Shearson and a
Beazer-controlled investor group from acquiring any more of the
company's stock and to award damages over the alleged manipulation
of the stock.
   BNS Partners on March 3 offered $45 per common share and $107.75
per preferred share, or $1.26 billion for shares it did not already
control. The offer is scheduled to expire March 30.
   BNS is a general partnership, 49 percent owned by Bright
Aggregates Inc., of Dallas, itself a unit of Beazer PLC. The
British company is chaired by Beazer.
   ``Shearson proposed making a tender offer for Koppers to ...
Beazer. Shearson was and remains the driving force behind the
offer, and it controls the offer,'' Koppers said.
   Shearson officials did not immediately return telephone calls
for comment. ``Despite the fact that Shearson has combined with an
English predator to dismember an American company, it holds itself
out to the public as assisting businesses in protecting against
takeovers,'' the suit said.
   The lawsuit claims that the terms of the takeover financing are
so vague that is questionable.
   ``BNS does not have adequate funding to complete the offer and
has obtained only a self-styled commitment for only about one-third
of the amount that it will require,'' the suit said.
   Koppers claims the offer is misleading in light of Beazer's
subsequent comments on plans to sell Koppers' chemical and building
products businesses, which together account for 40 percent of
annual sales.
   ``Koppers stockholders are being misled as to the value of the
stock they are being asked to tender,'' the suit said.

Friday that PaineWebber Inc. voluntarily has agreed to repay

Treasury bond coupons.
   The SEC did not disclose the amount of the repayment or of the

   The regulatory agency said in a statement that it was accepting

Paine Webber charged its customers ``undisclosed excessive markups
and markdowns not reasonably related to the prevailing market
price.''
   It said that the sales at issue involved ``stripped'' Treasury
bond coupons _ bonds stripped of their interest component and sold
separately at a discount, a common practice of brokerage houses.
   The SEC said it took into account that PaineWebber was
volunarily agreeing to reimburse its customers.

   The stock market lost more ground in a bouncing
session today, extending Thursday's sharp decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 48.24 points on
Thursday, dropped 6.47 to 2,019.56 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 544 up, 998 down and
417 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 175.42 million shares with an
hour to go.
   A big chunk of that activity came in the stock of MFS
Intermediate Income Trust, which traded at 10 after a 200
million-share initial offering at that price.
   The debut of the closed-end investment company specializing in
interest-bearing securities with maturities of 10 years or less
marked the largest initial public stock offering ever in the U.S.
market.
   Otherwise, analysts said traders were a bit unnerved by
Thursday's drop, which was the largest in more than two months.
   Stocks drew little lasting support from falling interest rates
in the credit markets, where prices of long-term Treasury bonds
rose as much as $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   The bond market got a lift from news of an unexpected 0.2
percent decline in the producer price index last month and a
relatively modest 0.6 percent rise in retail sales for the same
period.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric dropped [ to
42~; Eastman Kodak { to 41|; International Business Machines \ to
113{, and American Telephone & Telegraph ] to 27~.
   Home Shopping Network, traded on the American Stock Exchange,
fell 1\ to 6\. The company reported lower quarterly earnings.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost

<HEAD>Kuwait Declares 21.25 Percent Stake in BP; Seeks 22.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait will raise its stake in British Petroleum
Co. PLC to 22.5 percent but no more, and will not seek
representation on the board of directors, an official of the
Persian Gulf nation's investment arm said Friday.
   The remarks, by the chief investment manager of the Kuwait
Investment Office, were the first direct statements of Kuwait's
immediate intentions toward BP.
   Industry analysts disagreed on the Arab country's motives. Some
said they believed Kuwait's previous assertations that it was
simply buying the shares as an investment.
   Others suggested it was buying the stake as a first step in an
effort to establish closer ties, ultimately giving Kuwait access to
BP's extensive refining and marketing operations in Europe and the
United States.
   The Kuwaiti agency raised speculation it was building on its
19.53 percent stake by announcing early Friday that it held 1.269
billion BP shares, or 21.25 percent.
   The stake breached the 20 percent level BP has said is
acceptable.
   ``KIO policy with regard to all its investments is to regard
them as investments and not as a means of influencing the policy of
the company in question,'' said the Kuwait office's chief
investment manager, Trevor Ball. ``This is equally so in the case
of BP.''
   ``The KIO looks on this as a long term holding in a company for
whose management and policy KIO have a high regard and which it is
confident will act in the interests of shareholders,'' he said.
``For that reason KIO doesn't propose to seek representation on its
board.''
   The Kuwait office said it will increase its stake to a target
22.5 percent as soon as market conditions permit. BP refused to
comment on the situation Friday.
   Jeremy Elden, an oil analyst at the British brokerage Phillips
and Drew, said Kuwait originally intended to build up a 25 percent
stake in BP.
   Elden said the 22.5 percent target stake ``looks like a classic
compromise'' worked out between between BP chairman Sir Peter
Walters and Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah.
   Kuwait had hoped for a 25 percent stake in BP because that would
give it the right to block special resolutions put to BP
shareholders, Elden said. The resolutions have to receive approval
of at least 75 percent of the stockholders.
   ``That would have given them real power over the company, if
they had ever wanted to exercise it,'' Elden said.
   In Milwaukee, Wis., George J. Gaspar, an analyst with the Robert
W. Baird & Co. securities firm, said he thought Kuwait eventually
hopes to ``trade its stock for a position in BP's downstream
operations.
   ``They keep saying it's only for investment, but I don't believe
it,'' he said. ``I think Kuwait is going to use its investment in
BP to encourage some joint operation between the two.''
   Kuwait is just one of several large producers to have taken
steps in the direction of acquiring interests that would provide
guaranteed long-term outlets for their supplies.
   Texaco Inc. and Saudi Arabia are in the midst of negotiating a
joint venture involving Texaco's refining and marketing operations.
   Those talks come less than two years after Venezuela acquired
half of Southland Corp.'s Citgo Petroleum Co. refinery operations,
an interest in Champlain Oil in the United States, and other
ventures in Europe.
   Not all industry-watchers agree with Gaspar's theory, however.
   Stephen Smith, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Co., said he
believed Kuwait's BP stake is ``just an investment.''
   ``Kuwait's got plenty of channels for its refined products
already,'' he said. ``They've done at least two, maybe three deals
for outlets in Europe, where they're selling their products under
the name, Q8.''
   The Kuwaiti office began accumulating BP shares soon after BP's
2.7 billion pound share offering was massively undersubscribed last
October. In February it declared a 19.53 percent stake, or 1.165
billion shares.
   Walters indicated in February that he viewed the Kuwait office's
stake as acceptable provided the office didn't increase its holding
beyond 20 percent.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Friday in lackluster trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Most soybean contracts advanced on higher soybean oil prices and
on talk that U.S. soybean plantings will not exceed 60 million

   Traders have been worried about the possibility of a sharper
increase in planted soybean acreage, which totaled 57.4 million

   Why do Americans have different beers for
different times of the day, asked a visiting Soviet public
relations executive who was confused by some U.S. advertising
techniques and wound up confusing his hosts.
   Valentin V. Kozitsyn, who is traveling with a Soviet cultural
exhibit now at Cincinnati's Union Terminal center, had some
questions for members of the Cincinnati public relations company he
visited Thursday.
   Employees at Smith Kaufman Public Relations were confused by his
beer question.
   They understood when Kozitsyn explained that he had seen a
television commercial saying ``the night belongs to Michelob.''
   And another thing: ``Why is K mart America's favorite store?''
he asked.
   Any advertising or public relations effort in the Soviet Union
is ``done very slowly, with much care and deliberation,'' Kozitsyn
said. He described the American media as fast, colorful and timely.
   ``There is much to learn about the methods here,'' he said.
   Much of Thursday's informal discussion was spent explaining to
Kozitsyn the distinctions between U.S. advertising, public
relations and journalism.
   ``In our country, it isn't so important to explain everything,''
he said.
   Kozitsyn said interest in public relations methodology is
increasing in the Soviet Union because the country, under Communist
Party leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is taking a hard look at its
traditions.
   ``We have not only successes _ we have mistakes,'' Kozitsyn
said. ``There is a need for us to explain our mistakes in history
and modern life. ... There is the need to understand truths.''
   ``There is much we need to teach our own people, and much to
learn about accomplishing that,'' Kozitsyn said.
   Lora L. Doerr, an account supervisor with Smith Kaufman, said
the Cincinnati firm first came in contact with Kozitsyn while
arranging publicity for the exhibit.

   Crude oil prices moved deeper into $16-a-barrel
territory Friday, but analysts disagreed as to whether fundamental
or technical factors were responsible for the two-day breakout
above the $15 range.
   Some said traders were anticipating new moves by oil producing
countries to trim their excessive output, bringing world supply and
demand closer into balance. Others, noting that continuous
profit-taking had dampened the rally Friday, suggested that it
lacked strong conviction.
   Contracts for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, closed 29 cents higher at $16.29 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, adding to
Thursday's strong 51-cent gain.
   Refined products also built on Thursday's robust advance.
Wholesale heating oil settled at 44.69 cents a gallon, up 0.76 cent
after Thursday's 0.90 cent gain. Wholesale unleaded gasoline closed
at 45.59 cents a gallon, up 0.45 cent after leaping 1.14 cents
Thursday.
   ``There's a growing confidence that, by whatever means it might
take, our oil-exporting friends will contain the discounting and
get prices moving up,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Since late last year, sluggish demand and growing surpluses have
put downward pressure on oil prices. That weakness was aggravated
by discounting on the part of members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Analysts said the 13-nation cartel has been sticking to its
aggregate quota of 17.5 million barrels a day, but that the total
goal, set in December, was simply too high for the world's needs.
   As a result, by early this week prices had eroded to levels
between $13 and $14 per barrel in the Persian Gulf _ far short of
OPEC's $18 target _ and to $15.37 per barrel on the New York Merc,
$2 to $3 cheaper than January levels.
   Indications that worried OPEC and non-member countries were
attempting to find ways to boost those prices sent the market
strongly higher Thursday _ although crude had picked up 12 cents in
light trading on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   While crude continued to gain ground in Friday's session,
however, product prices did not ``put in all that good a showing,''
said Jayne Ball, an analyst at the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
securities firm.
   ``At this point, it's unclear whether this is just a technical
correction ... or whether it's a serious recovery,'' she said.

<HEAD>Bank of Boston Agrees To Freeze Panamanian Transactions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The First National Bank of Boston agreed Friday to
freeze activity on Panamanian government accounts until the State
Department lifts sanctions against the nation.
   The action stems from a civil suit filed earlier this week by
Panama's U.S. ambassador, Juan B. Sosa, the recognized
representative of the government of deposed President Eric Arturo
Delvalle.
   A federal judge Tuesday issued a temporary injunction against
payments to any Panamanian government agency from accounts at Bank
of Boston and four Florida-based banks. In addition, a restraining
order was issued Friday by a federal judge in New York against the
Bank of Boston International, which holds a Panama government
clearing account.
   Under a settlement filed in U.S. District Court in Boston, the
Bank of Boston prohibits transactions against any account of the
Republic of Panama, Banco Nationale de Panama or Petroterminale de
Panama, unless approved by Sosa.
   Bank of Boston, however, can transfer up to $4 million a month
to Petroterminale from its Panama branch to cover salaries and
operating expenses for the company, which runs a ship fuel pipeline
alongside the Panama canal.
   The settlement, presented to District Judge Edward Harrington,
was reached following talks between lawyers representing the bank
and the Delvalle government, overthrown in late February by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Attorney Michael Gardener, representing the Delvalle government,
estimated the Bank of Boston handles ``several million dollars'' in
Panamanian government assets.
   Bank spokesman Wayne Taylor declined to estimate a figure, but
said the bank's settlement may set a precedent for Sosa's suit
against the Florida banks.
   Defendants in that suit are the Citizens and Southern
International Bank, Republic National Bank of Miami, Barnett Bank
of Florida and the Bank of New England International.
   A federal judge in Miami has scheduled a March 16 hearing for
the suit.
   On March 7, a federal judge in New York added 10 days to a
restraining order preventing Marine Midland and Bankers Trust from
transferring an estimated $50 million to the Banco Nationale de
Panama.
   Irving Trust was dropped from that order after agreeing not to
transfer any money to the Panama bank. Last Wednesday, another
defendant, Republic National Bank of New York, was dropped when it
agreed to transfer $10 million in Panamanian funds to the Federal
Reserve Bank.
   Delvalle is still recognized by the U.S. government as the
legitimate head of Panama.
   Two U.S. grand juries in Florida indicted Noriega on drug
charges Feb. 4. Delvalle sought to dismiss Noriega Feb. 25, but was
ousted the next day by Noriega supporters and went into hiding.

<HEAD>Former Litton Executive Sentenced to 3 Years in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former defense industry official was
sentenced Friday to three years in prison and fined $5,000 for his
part in a scheme that overcharged the government nearly $9 million
in military contracts.
   Roland Edward Fisher, 57, of suburban Drexel Hill, former vice
president and general manager of Litton Systems, Inc., pleaded
unsuccessfully for leniency through his attorney before U.S.
District Judge Robert Kelly.
   Litton was earlier fined $6.3 million for its part in the
price-rigging conspiracy.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Harbest, in seeking lengthy
incarceration, said ``Fisher was entrusted with the taxpayer's
funds and abused that trust. A prison sentence will send a ringing
message to other defense industry executives that this type of
conduct will no longer go unnoticed and unpunished.''
   Harbest told the judge that Fisher, between January 1975 and
December 1984, set prices for the goverment contracts Litton
obtained that were well above the real costs to produce the item
and that other individual defendants participated in the scheme.
   Specifically, Fisher was found guilty of racketeering,
obstruction of a government agency's proceedings, making false
statements and mail fraud.
   Two other Litton employees were sentenced earlier in the case.
   Michael Millspaugh, 35, a former controller from Buffalo Grove,
Ill., received one year and a $10,000 fine, while Joseph DiLiberto,
69, a former materials manager, of Levittown, Pa., received 5
years' probation and a $10,000 fine.
   Both had pleaded guilty.

<HEAD>50 Point `Collar' Cooling Volatility But Could Raise Other
Problems</HEAD>

   The New York Stock Exchange's 5-week-old
``collar'' on computerized trading appears to be an effective
therapy for easing volatility in the post-crash market and luring
back frightened investors, analysts say.
   But the restriction also makes the market less attractive to
investors who thrive on risk, which could drive them overseas.
   And some market experts even argue that the restriction would do
little to squelch another panic.
   The collar, as NYSE officials call it, has played a role in
blunting runaway moves in the Dow Jones industrial average since it
was enacted Feb. 4, judging from the market's behavior since then.
   It works by banning use of the exchange's computers for a
trading technique known as index arbitrage when the Dow average
moves 50 points from the previous close. An earlier, voluntary
restraint was triggered by a 75-point change.
   Since the 50-point collar was announced, it has never been
breached. The Dow average approached it three times, moving up
47.58 on Feb. 10, up 48.41 on Feb. 29, and down 48.24 on Thursday.
   ``I think it's got to be more than coincidence that it doesn't
get to 50,'' said Richard Wholey, a broker-analyst at the Wayne
Hummer & Co. investment firm in Chicago. ``I would say there's got
to be a very strong connection.''
   By comparison, in pre-collar days the Dow average jumped 76.42
points Jan. 4, fell 140.58 points Jan. 8 and fell 57.20 points Jan.
20. It exceeded a 50-point swing six times in December and four
times in November.
   Last October, when the market suffered the worst decline since
the Great Crash of 1929, the Dow average careened over 50 points 12
times, capped by the unprecedented 508 point plunge on Black
Monday, Oct. 19.
   Some Wall Street strategists knowledgeable about index arbitrage
believe the collar directly influences market behavior. When index
arbitrage traders see the Dow average moving 40 or more points
beyond the previous close, they turn off the computers that run the
automatic trading programs.
   ``The limit is a definite factor,'' said Leigh Stevens, stock
index futures strategist at PaineWebber Inc. in New York. ``The
traders will see they are near it. They'll stop at that point,
because if it's going to touch 50, they'd be forbidden to use it
for the rest of the day.''
   Index arbitrage enables investors to sell massive volumes of
stock in New York and simultaneously buy the equivalent stock-index
futures traded in Chicago, or vice versa, in an attempt to profit
from price differences.
   The technique has been blamed for playing a role in the Wall
Street crash and subsequent price swings that frightened millions
of ordinary investors.
   Several prominent Wall Street firms, concerned they were killing
their own business and arousing congressional hostility, have since
abandoned index arbitrage for their own accounts.
   ``I don't see anything under the surface that's detrimental
about the New York Stock Exchange's limitation,'' said John A.
Conlon Jr., executive vice president and director of institutional
equity research at Nikko Securities Co. International in New York.
``Any step toward attempting to quell the kind of volatility we saw
is an intelligent posture.''
   Others agreed but said the limit was discouraging speculators
who thrive on the risky futures markets. This has helped cause a
drop in the futures business and raised fears that less restrictive
foreign markets will benefit.
   ``I consider the collar a stabilizer, and from the point of view
of the country or market as a whole, it's very positive,'' said
Haskel B. Benishay, an economics professor and market expert at
Northwestern University's Kellogg graduate business school.
   ``But of course it's less exciting and creates less
opportunities for index arbitrage program traders to make money,''
he said.
   Some futures experts believe the NYSE's move reflects a broader
failure by the securities business to take coordinated steps aimed
at averting another market collapse, a key recommendation of a
presidential commission.
   The critics say the NYSE's collar won't mesh with the
circuit-breaking mechanisms imposed in the futures market since the
crash.
   New price limits established to regulate stock index futures
trading on Chicago exchanges could theoretically paralyze those
markets in response to a sharp decline in prices. In such a case,
traders would rush to dump stocks on the NYSE, which would be
prevented by its collar from relieving the pressure.
   ``If we should have a sharp market break, the markets would
unlink automatically,'' Alger B. Chapman, chairman of the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, told an annual futures industry meeting in
Florida earlier this week. ``It would be worse than in October.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined in quiet trading Friday as
foreign-exchange markets awaited next week's release of U.S. trade
figures for January.
   Gold prices slipped after soaring as much as $7 a troy ounce on
Thursday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid
price of $441.25 for an ounce of gold, down from $442.50 late
Thursday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar opened lower in New York,
reaching trading levels set in overseas activity, but moved little
the rest of the day.
   Volume was light in advance of the weekend. There was more
interest in trading in the other major currencies, which dominated
the markets for much of the week.
   Earl I. Johnson, assistant vice president with Harris Trust and
Savings Bank in Chicago, said the market was waiting for two
announcements expected next week: the British budget, to be
unveiled on Tuesday, and U.S. trade figures for January, to be
released Thursday.
   The trade figures have set off wide swings in the dollar in
recent months, and Johnson said that trend may continue next week.
   Traders are focusing on the British budget because the pound
surged earlier this week in response to higher interest rates and
continued economic strength in that country.
   The British pound continued to climb against the dollar Friday,
trading in London at $1.8535, up from $1.8435 late Thursday. In
later New York trading, the pound rose to $1.8562 from $1.8462 late
Thursday.
   The pound has leaped by 4 percent in value against the dollar
this week. But traders said the rally appeared to be running out of
steam on a statement Thursday by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson that sterling would be unable to sustain a further advance.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.80 Japanese yen, down from
Thursday's close of 128.20 yen. Later in London, it fell to 127.80
yen and in New York, it slipped to 127.295 yen from 127.955 yen
late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.6502 West German marks, down from
1.66345; 1.3696 Swiss francs, down from 1.3785; 5.6460 French
francs, down from 5.6665; 1,231.00 Italian lire, down from
1,236.625; and 1.25705 Canadian dollars, up marginally from 1.25685.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rate, included: 1.6615 West German marks, down from 1.6640; 1.3720
Swiss francs, down from 1.3785; 5.6515 French francs, down from
5.6725; 1.8680 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8720; 1,232.55 Italian
lire, down from 1,236.63; and 1.2553 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2564.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $440.50 a troy ounce,
down from late Thursday's $443. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold was
also lower, closing at a bid $441, compared with $442.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $445.48, up
from $438.42 late Thursday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fell to $441.40 a
troy ounce in late trading from $443.20 late Thursday.
   Silver bullion prices remained stable in London, where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.36 a troy ounce, the same as
late Thursday. On the Commodity Exchange, silver fell to $6.230 a
troy ounce in late trading from $6.265 late Thursday.

   Home Shopping Network Inc., the leader in
televised shop-from-home programs, said Friday that telephone
problems were responsible for a 44 percent decline in
second-quarter earnings.
   The telephone problems _ since corrected _ prevented some
potential customers from placing orders, and contributed to an
inventory buildup that the company is still trying to reduce by
cutting prices on some merchandise, according to Roy Speer,
chairman and chief executive of Home Shopping.
   At a briefing for securities analysts conducted at the American
Stock Exchange, Speer said, ``We're out of the telephone problems
now and we hope that the future will be bright.''
   Nonetheless, the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based company's stock
slumped in the wake of the earnings report. Home Shopping fell
$1.37{ a share to $6.12{ in trading on the Amex.
   Mark Riely, who follows the company for the investment firm
Eberstadt Fleming, said, ``The phone situation may have hurt them
last year, but one would have expected sales to have been higher in
last couple of quarters.''
   For the three months ended Feb. 29, Home Shopping said it earned
$5.2 million, or 6 cents per share, compared with $9.3 million, or
10 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 16.6 percent to $192.8 million from
$165.3 million a year earlier.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, the company said it
earned $8.3 million, or 10 cents a share, down 56 percent from
$18.8 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose 41 percent to $378.8 million from $268.7
million a year earlier.
   Speer told the analysts that the company's sales of $582 million
for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 1987 had fallen far short of the
$800 million the company had forecast for the year.
   But he said the reason was that the telephone system the company
was using proved incapable of handling the volume of calls that
Home Shopping's two television networks were generating.
   The company had ordered merchandise on the presumption that it
would sell $800 million worth of goods last year, he said, and
couldn't halt deliveries.
   As a result, he said the company's inventory rose steadily to a
peak of $135 million in November. He said the company has been
liquidating it gradually by cutting prices, but that the backlog
remains at $78 million.
   The company didn't discover the telephone problem until last
April, Speer said, and has since changed telephone companies and
filed a suit against its former telephone service supplier.
   He said the new phone system is operating well and that the
company helped itself by moving its operations into a new and
bigger facility in St. Petersburg. The network's old facility was
in Clearwater.
   Home Shopping sells merchandise ranging from jewelry to
computers on two television networks that are carried on cable
systems seen by about 19 million subscribers or satellite dish
owners and on 22 broadcast television stations reaching about 37
million households.
   The company has previously said it planned to sell financial
services through the television networks, but officials indicated
they are taking a more deliberate approach in that area.
   Lowell Paxson, president of Home Shopping, had told a marketing
group last May that the television networks would be selling
financial products by the spring of 1988. On Friday, he said the
telephone problems had commanded so much of management's attention
that that timetable had been delayed.
   But he noted that in the past six months, Home Shopping had
acquired two seats on the New York Stock Exchange and one seat on
the Amex and bought a Dallas-based brokerage, Wealth Planning
Resource Center.
   Paxson said Home Shopping hopes to sell a family of investment
funds through the television programs eventually, but said, ``We
are going to move very slowly'' and declined to estimate when that
would be.

   The stock market staged a strong recovery near
the close Friday to finish higher after a broad early selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 20
points at midafternoon, closed with a gain of 8.95 at 2,034.98. For
the week the average lost 22.88 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 856 up, 676 down and 464 unchanged.
Earlier, declines had predominated by as much as 2 to 1.
   Big Board volume totaled 200.02 million shares, against 197.26
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index rose
.53 to 149.45.
   Analysts said traders were a bit unnerved by Thursday's drop in
stock prices, when the Dow Jones industrials fell 48.24 points for
their largest loss in more than two months.
   But a midsession slide gave way to buying Friday as the Dow
dropped to near the 2,000 level.
   Stocks drew some support from falling interest rates in the
credit markets, where prices of long-term Treasury bonds rose more
than $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   The bond market got a lift from news of an unexpected 0.2
percent decline in the producer price index last month and a
relatively modest 0.6 percent rise in retail sales for the same
period.
   A big chunk of Friday's activity came in the stock of MFS
Intermediate Income Trust, which traded at 10 on turnover of more
than 35 million shares after a 200 million-share initial offering
at that price.
   The debut of the closed-end investment company specializing in
interest-bearing securities with maturities of 10 years or less
marked the largest initial public stock offering ever in the U.S.
market.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric gained | to
43|; International Business Machines 1} to 115{, and Exxon { to
42[. American Telephone & Telegraph slipped \ to 28 and Eastman
Kodak was down ] at 41}.
   Home Shopping Network, traded on the American Stock Exchange,
fell 1] to 6[. The company reported a 44 percent earnings decline
for its latest fiscal quarter.
   Super Valu Stores finished unchanged at 23 after trading as high
as 24[. The company, which has been the subject of takeover
speculation, said it hadn't received any offers and knew of no
reason for the recent activity in its stock.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $5.93 billion, or 0.23
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 224.82 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.14 to 307.39,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.10 at 264.94.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.28 to 375.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 296.09, up .09.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Leap On Technical Factors; Drop In Deliverable
Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for May and July delivery of cotton surged Friday on a
combination of technical factors, bargain hunting and concerns
about a drop in supplies, analysts said.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures finished mostly
higher in a volatile session; precious metals were mixed; grains
and soybeans were mixed; energy futures advanced; and stock-index
futures moved higher.
   Strong technical buying boosted near-month cotton futures prices
on the New York Cotton Exchange, but fundamental factors also
played a role in the rally, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist in
New York for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``From a fundamental point of view, the futures market is the
cheapest market around for U.S. cotton,'' Simon said.
   With futures priced three to five cents below cash, cotton users
who do not need supplies immediately can buy cotton at a bargain on
the futures market.
   But the buying interest also tends to raise futures prices,
effectively bringing the futures markets more in line with cash
prices.
   Simon also noted some ``decertifications'' of deliverable
stocks, indicating a company with obligations to deliver cotton
planned to make those shipments using the type of cotton traded on
the Cotton Exchange.
   Cotton settled .60 cent to 1.45 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in May at 63.20 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures ended higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
in a volatile session marked by a failed attempt to rally the live
cattle market above its previous highs.
   Traders bid the April contract up to 73.50 cents a pound, just
.05 cent shy of the contract's lifetime high. But buying interest
disappeared at that point and the April contract dropped to 72.67
cents on profit-taking late in the day, said Philip Stanley, an
analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in Chicago. Prices
rebounded before the close, however.
   Hog futures contracts advanced despite the week's slaughter of
nearly 1.68 million head, the largest weekly slaughter of the
spring. Frozen pork bellies settled mostly lower on indications of
growing supplies.
   Live cattle settled .13 cent to .40 cent higher with April at
73.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .45 cent higher
with March at 82 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .10
cent higher with April at 43.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .45 cent lower to .70 cent higher with March at 51.20 cents a
pound.
   Gold and silver futures retreated on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
report showing a 0.2 percent drop in wholesale prices last month,
analysts said.
   Gold settled $1.80 to $2.60 lower with April at $442.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.5 cents to 8.7 cents lower with March at $6.23
a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mixed in lackluster trading on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Most soybean contracts advanced on higher soybean oil prices and
on talk that U.S. soybean plantings will not exceed 60 million
acres this year, analysts said.
   Traders have been worried about the possibility of a sharper
increase in planted soybean acreage, which totaled 57.4 million
acres in 1987.
   Wheat futures ended fractionally higher, corn was slightly lower
and oats closed modestly higher.
   Wheat settled unchanged to } cent higher with March at $2.90{ a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $1.96} a
bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 4} cents higher with March at $1.86 a
bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 2 cents higher with March at
$6.03{ a bushel.
   Crude oil futures prices advanced above the $16-a-barrel level
reached Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices for
future delivery of distilled products also advanced.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 22 cents
higher with April at $16.20 a barrel; heating oil was .52 cent to
.85 cent higher with April at 44.45 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .27 cent to .47 cent higher with April at 45.60 cents
a gallon.
   Stock-index futures moved higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 2.70 points higher at 161.45. The
underlying spot index advanced 3.50 points, closing at 169.25.

<HEAD>GSA Extends Deadline for Bids on New Government Phone System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Services Administration on Friday
extended by one month the deadline for bids on a new, multi-billion
dollar government telephone system to give US Sprint Communications
Co. more time to draft its proposal.
   The GSA said it was ``reluctantly'' extending the deadline to
April 29, but said it was doing so ``to insure the fullest possible
competition'' for the contract, one of the biggest ever let by the
government.
   Besides Sprint, only two other teams of companies are bidding on
the project, the work for which will be split 60-40 between two
vendors.
   The other bidders are a team led by American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. and another headed by Martin Marietta Corp. with MCI
Communications Corp.
   US Sprint, a joint venture of GTE Corp. and United
Telecommunications Inc., will team with GTE Government Systems,
according to industry sources who spoke on condition they not be
identified by name.
   The contract for the new telecommunications system, called
FTS-2000, is valued at as much as $25 billion over 10 years. The
winners will replace the government's 25-year-old phone system with
a state-of-the-art network for voice, data, video conferencing and
other communications services.
   The extension is the fifth time the bid deadline has been
postponed since the contract was opened to bidding in January 1987.
Last fall, under pressure from Congress, the GSA revised the
contract to split the award between two vendors instead of giving
it all to one bidder.
   US Sprint originally had teamed with Electronic Data Systems to
bid on the project, but they withdrew, citing confusion in the
procurement process. However, after the contract was revised US
Sprint decided to re-enter the bidding.
   US Sprint officials declined to comment on the company's request
for the extension, but the GSA said US Sprint needed the additional
time ``to address many functions and aspects of the procurement
they had previously assigned to EDS'' in the original joint venture.
   GSA Administrator Terence C. Golden said the agency determined
that ``US Sprint is indeed committed to competing for FTS-2000 and
has in place the necessary resources to live up to its commitment
to submit a proposal by April 29.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose Friday in reaction to news of a
decline in wholesale prices and slower-than-expected retail
spending.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 21-32 point, or
about $6.56 per $1,000 in face amount, as its yield fell to 8.50
percent from 8.55 percent late Thursday.
   The government reports were interpreted as bullish for bond
prices, said Elizabeth G. Reiners, vice president for money-market
research at the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices fell 0.2
percent in February, following a 0.4 percent rise in January. Bond
traders were heartened by the slowing in inflation, Ms. Reiners
said.
   The bond market fears inflation because it erodes the value of
fixed-income securities.
   Also Friday, the Commerce Department reported retail sales rose
0.6 percent in February. But the department also revised its
January figures to reflect a drop in consumer spending that month.
   Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overall economic
activity, so any dropoff heightens concern about a possible
recession. But bond traders respond bullishly to such negative
statistics because the Federal Reserve Board is considered unlikely
to rein in credit by raising interest rates if the economy is
sluggish.
   Bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions, so
lower interest rates mean bonds would be worth more.
   Partially offsetting the favorable news from the government was
an increase in oil prices and a small decline in the value of the
dollar.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues ranged 1-16 point to 3-32 point higher,
intermediate maturities rose between 5-32 point and 13-32 point and
20-year issues rose 23-32 point, according to figures provided by
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.

<HEAD>Delaware Court Denies Henley Request for Injunction against Santa
Fe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware chancery court judge Friday denied
Henley Group Inc.'s request for a preliminary injunction against
Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., clearing the way for Santa Fe's
restructuring plan to proceed.
   The legal action is the latest in a series of manuevers
involving Santa Fe and a pair of companies _ Henley and Olympia &
York of Toronto, Canada _ vying to take over the Chicago-based
railroad and energy conglomerate.
   The court's denial means Santa Fe will immediately begin issuing
debentures of $5 per share to stockholders who already received a
special cash dividend of $25 per share, Santa Fe spokesman Bob
Gehrt said.
   The debentures, at 16 percent interest, come due in 2004. The
payments are part of a restructuring plan aimed at thwarting a
hostile takeover bid from Henley of La Jolla, Calif.
   Henley had filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to block
issuance of the debentures.
   The lawsuit also asked the court to declare Santa Fe's recently
enacted shareholder-rights plan invalid, to rescind the appointment
of two Olympia & York executives to the Santa Fe board, and to
allow Henley to propose an amendment that would make it possible
for Henley to elect a majority of directors at the Santa Fe's
annual meeting May 24.
   Vice Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs denied all four requests.
   ``We're studying the ruling and considering our alternatives,''
said Henley spokesman Norman Ritter.
   Olympia & York, controlled by the Canada's Reichmann family, had
launched a tender offer to boost its own holdings in Santa Fe, but
agreed to support the restructuring in exchange for board
representation.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Releases Wall Street Speculator to Psychiatric
Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street speculator John Mulheren, accused of
plotting to kill convicted financier Ivan Boesky and a former
Boesky aide, arrived at a private psychiatric hospital Thursday
after a federal appeals court lifted an order preventing his
release from prison detention.
   Mulheren went to the Carrier Foundation in Belle Mead, N.J.,
following the morning ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Manhattan.
   ``The family and John are delighted with the results and look
forward to the day when John can be home with them,'' said one of
Mulheren's attorneys, Otto Obermaier.
   The court denied the government's motion to continue holding
Mulheren in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, saying evidence
provided by a psychiatrist showed the speculator presented no
danger.
   The government had argued that the private facility was not
secure enough to house Mulheren, the senior partner at Jamie
Securities Co. and a former friend of Boesky, central figure in an
insider trading scandal.
   Mulheren, carrying a loaded assault rifle, was arrested Feb. 18
by the police outside his Rumson, N.J., home.
   He was charged with threatening to kill Boesky and Michael
Davidoff, Boesky's former head trader. The men reportedly have
implicated Mulheren in possible securities law violations.
   Mulheren's lawyers argue that he is a manic depressive who had
failed to take a drug used to control impulses.

Tax Fraud</HEAD>

   Charles Agee Atkins, the convicted promoter of a
billion-dollar tax scheme that attracted celebrities, was sentenced
Friday to two years in prison and four years' probation.
   Atkins told U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker that he felt
``deep remorse and I accept the responsibility for what occurred.''
   Lasker told Atkins that he felt the defendant was the ``most
culpable'' of the three defendants, but noted that he had received
hundreds of letters on his behalf.
   A co-defendant, William Hack, was sentenced to four months in
prison, four years, eight months on probation and fined $25,000.
The judge ordered him to perform 1,000 hours a year in community
service during probation.
   The third co-defendant, Ernest Grunebaum, was given a six-month
suspended sentence, probation of five years and ordered to do 400
hours of community service a year during probation.
   They remained free on bail and their sentences were stayed by
the judge pending the outcome of their appeals, according to James
A. Moss, Atkins' attorney.
   A 31-count indictment in March 1987 accused the three of
creating more than $1.3 billion in fraudulent losses and interest
expenses while trading in Treasury bill futures and other
government securities.
   Those losses generated more than $350 million in bogus tax
deductions for the investors, among them actor Michael Landon, the
late Andy Warhol and Postmaster General Preston R. Tisch.
   Others include Tisch's brother, CBS President and Chief
Executive Laurence A. Tisch, the late Lorne Greene, television
producer Norman Lear and actor Sidney Poitier.
   Lasker also sentenced Atkins to spend the first six months of
probation at a community center and then do 500 hours a year of
community service for the remaining time. Moss said the center is a
halfway house for those getting out of prison.
   The three were convicted in December of conspiring to defraud
the Internal Revenue Service; they could have received five years
in prison on that count alone.
   Atkins, of Amelia Island Plantation, Fla., also was convicted of
27 other tax-related counts; Hack, of New York City, was convicted
of three; Grunebaum, of Chappaqua, N.Y., was convicted on 13 more
counts. Grunebaum was acquitted on two counts.
   Those who invested are not accused of wrongdoing but will have
to square accounts with the IRS about back taxes on the $4 in tax
deductions they were supposed to get for every $1 invested.

<HEAD>Court Orders Farmers Group to Put BATUS Proposal Before
Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge in Nevada on Friday ordered
insurer Farmers Group Inc. to put a merger proposal from unwanted
suitor BATUS Inc. before shareholders at Farmers' annual meeting
May 20.
   The court also ordered Farmers to make its shareholder lists
available to BATUS by next Wednesday so BATUS can effectively
solicit proxies for its proposal.
   However, the judge did instruct that the non-binding proposal be
revised to recommend only that Farmers' board reconsider its
decision not to negotiate with Louisville, Ky.-based BATUS, the
U.S. subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC of Britain.
   As initially drafted, BATUS' proposal recommended that Farmers
immediately enter negotiations with BATUS.
   Earlier this month, BATUS began a hostile $63-a-share, or $4.4
billion, tender offer after its initial friendly overtures were
spurned by Farmers. The offer expires March 30.
   BATUS said it was ``very pleased'' with the court action, which
requires Farmers to include BATUS' negotiation proposal in Farmers'
proxy cards being sent to shareholders for the annual meeting.
   In a separate statement, Farmers didn't go beyond outlining the
decision and reiterating its opposition to BATUS' takeover effort.
   Farmers, based in Los Angeles, filed suit in Nevada because that
is where it is incorporated.
   The judge's decision came just one day after Farmers' board of
directors unanimously rejected the BATUS offer as inadequate and
urged its shareholders to do likewise.
   Farmers said Thursday it was exploring a variety of alternatives
to a BATUS takeover, including restructuring or merging with
another company, adding that it has held discussions with an
unidentified third party about a possible leveraged buyout.
   BATUS has asked repeatedly to meet with Farmers management to
discuss all conditions of its takeover bid including price, but
Farmers has said it is not interested in such a meeting and
believes BATUS' offer is substantially less than the company is
worth.
   Farmers is the nation's third-largest home and auto insurer
after State Farm and Allstate and is the seventh-largest property
and casualty insurer.

   NASA reductions in shuttle redesign
efforts have been blamed for Morton Thiokol Inc.'s layoff of more
than 100 workers from its Space Division.
   Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said Friday that another 100
employees have been transferred from the division to other jobs in
the company's Wasatch Operations.
   The Space Division has a work force of more than 2,600.
   Raab said the layoffs came after the company learned NASA is
going to limit some small-scale tests and other analyses in the
shuttle redesign efforts.
   However, none of the large-scale tests will be cut, he said.
   The company has been working on a redesigned shuttle booster
rocket since the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster. A presidential
commission blamed a leaking rocket seal for igniting the explosion
that destroyed the shuttle and killed its seven-member crew.
   Meantime, Morton Thiokol also is reorganizing management in its
Strategic Division to improve safety control and efficiency, Raab
said.
   Two other divisions under the Aerospace Group, tactical and
automotive products, won't be affected by the changes, he said.
   Raab offered few details of the management restructuring, but
the Standard-Examiner reported Friday that a Morton Thiokol
employee, who asked to remain anonymous, said the move was at least
partially due to the Dec. 29, 1987, fire at an MX missile motor
plant that killed five workers.
   ``I think that put the icing on the cake,'' said the employee.

<HEAD>Greenspan Asks Deficit Reduction, Hold On Taxes, Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation must take ``bold controversial
actions'' to control federal spending in order to reduce the huge
budget deficit, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Thursday.
   Greenspan also indicated the Fed would continue making the
battle against high inflation the cornerstone of its long-term
monetary policy.
   Greenspan, at a luncheon of the Federal Reserve's 12th District
banks, emphasized that future federal budget cuts _ not tax
increases _ would be a major factor in bringing down the massive
deficit.
   Hiking taxes ``carries with it the risk that expenditures also
will be raised, and that the resulting deficit improvement will be
small,'' Greenspan said.
   He referred to the tax resistance movement of the 1970s, chiefly
triggered by California's successful tax-limiting Proposition 13
ballot initiative.
   Greenspan _ who previously has called for slashing the budget
deficit _ reiterated the Federal Reserve's recent report to
Congress that gross national product was expected to grow by 2.5
percent in 1988, while time prices were expected to climb between 3
percent and 4 percent.
   The nation could not count on continued foreign capital inflows
to help finance the deficit, Greenspan said, calling such a trend
``neither a satisfactory nor a sustainable solution over the long
run.''
   Greenspan also said that keeping inflation pressures under
control was critical to continued progress in reducing the deficit.
   ``In this regard, monetary policy must maintain, as a long-run
objective, establishing reasonable price stability,'' he said.
   Greenspan praised what he said was the public's alertness to the
dangers of inflation, and said he sensed ``there is still a deep
reservoir of support for policies to keep inflation in check.''
