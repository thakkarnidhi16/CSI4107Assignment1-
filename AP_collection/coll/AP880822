   Hours after soldiers blocked opposition
deputies from examining ballots in the disputed July 6 elections,
the government party assured the nation Monday that a new congress
will be certified by a Sept. 1 deadline.
   Soldiers wearing helmets and carrying automatic rifles stopped
about 150 opposition representatives late Sunday night from
entering a room at the Legislative Palace where millions of ballots
are being held.
   The deputies-elect said the ballots would prove opposition
charges that the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, rigged the election. The army is required to guard the ballots
until the election is certified.
   The air of antagonism at the Chamber of Deputies, now sitting as
an electoral college, raised the question of whether the review
will be finished in time for the president to swear in a new
chamber by the constitutional deadline.
   The PRI holds a slim plurality in the chamber. Once the chamber
finishes ratifying 26 disputed congressional races, it is supposed
to move on to the presidential election.
   By custom, the outgoing chief executive formally introduces his
successor to the nation on Sept. 1 during his final
state-of-the-union address. Failure to do so would be an
embarrassing breach of tradition, even though the new president is
not sworn in until Dec. 1.
   Missing the deadline could ``interrupt the constitutional order
and put the nation on the threshold of a coup d'etat'' Francisco
Cardenas, one of Mexico's best-known political commentators, said
Monday in the independent daily El Universal.
   The confrontation between soldiers and deputies was the latest
in a series of incidents that marked the review of an election
which produced unprecedented opposition gains. It was front-page
news throughout Mexico.
   Before dawn on Monday, a few hours after the incident, the
leader of the PRI delegation, Guillermo Jimenez, told reporters
``there will be a chamber on time'' despite the conflict.
   The showdown prompted two prominent Roman Catholic clergymen to
issue statements. The archbishops of Zacatecas, Javier Lozano
Barragan, and of Chihuahua, Disan Vazquez, said they hoped common
sense would prevail and the electoral college would finish by Sept.
1.
   The PRI-dominated Federal Election Commission has said the PRI
candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, won with 50.36 percent of the
vote.
   Mexican presidents serve single, six-year terms beginning on
Dec. 1. The PRI has won every presidential election since it was
created in 1929.
   Lucia Santes, a leader of the opposition Democratic Front
coalition party in southeastern Tabasco state, meanwhile said she
had switched to the PRI. She said she had been the object of ``low
blows, envy and rancor'' and that the PRI ``represents the real
option for change.''
   The Santes defection was a blow to supporters of Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, presidential candidate for the Democratic Front, the
largest opposition party, who ran strongly in Tabasco. Cardenas
came in second place in presidential voting but maintains that a
fair count would make him the winner.
   Late Monday, Cardenas filed criminal charges against Manuel
Bartlett Diaz, president of the Federal Election Commission, and
Fernando Elias Calles, the technical secretary, accusing them of
violating the electoral code by not releasing individual results
from nearly half of the 55,000 voting stations nationwide.
   Bartlett also is interior minister.
   ``We asked that the (vote) information be made known and that
the authorities fulfill their responsibility,'' Cardenas said.
   He brought charges against the two earlier this month but was
told he needed to file personally with the federal attorney
general's office.

   Temperatures fell, the wind died down and the Army arrived
Monday, improving conditions for weary firefighters battling forest
fires that have charred thousands of acres of Montana and Wyoming,
especially in Yellowstone National Park.
   A first wave of 612 infantrymen from Fort Lewis, Wash., landed
at Bozeman, Mont., and headed for the 157,000-acre Clover Mist fire
in Yellowstone's northeastern corner.
   Soldiers were to help prevent the fire, one of 10 burning in the
park involving about 350,000 acres, from crossing into Montana's
Custer National Forest or commercial areas of Wyoming's Shoshone
National Forest.
   Park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said it was possible some of the
soldiers might remain in the southern Montana towns of Cooke City
and Silvergate to help protect them from the Clover Mist fire
burning about 3 miles to the south.
   Approximately 3,000 firefighters were at work in Yellowstone,
the nation's first national park.
   Elsewhere, reinforcements were called out in Idaho to back up
firefighters working to keep the 700-acre Eagle Bar fire away from
a timber sale tract in the Payette National Forest. Spokeswoman
Carla Tipton said two 20-member crews were on the scene and three
more were expected; an order was put in for 280 more people.
   Wind blew at only 5 to 15 mph Monday in Yellowstone, down from
Saturday's 60 mph gusts.
   However, the park's south entrance remained closed, forcing
visitors coming from the south to detour about 150 miles to the
park's west entrance at West Yellowstone, Mont. The northern gate
and two eastern entries remained open.
   Other roads closed included the road from the south entrance to
West Thumb Junction, on the shore of Yellowstone Lake; the road
from Madison Junction to Norris Juction and on to Indian Creek; and
from Norris to Canyon Junction, an east-west shortcut between the
western and eastern sides of the main road that circles the park in
a rough hourglass pattern.
   The closings basically cut off the shortest route between the
west and north entrances. And closing the Norris-Canyon road meant
the trip from Madison Junction on the western side of the park to
the famous Fishing Bridge in the east went from 39 miles up to 54,
by way of the Old Faithful geyser. The majority of the park
remained accessible.
   In addition, the Grant Village area, which contains a hotel,
campground, visitor center and park staff dormitories, was closed,
as were the Norris, Pebble Creek, Madison and Lewis Lake
campgrounds. The park contains 12 campgrounds.
   South of Yellowstone, in Grand Teton National Park and the
Bridger-Teton National Forest, the Hunter fire that had grown to
more than 2,900 acres in one day had calmed Monday, said Don
Bright, fire information officer.
   In addition, firefighters completed bulldozer lines around the
southwest and northwest flanks of the Hunter blaze, and officials
allowed residents evacuated Saturday to return to their homes, as
well as guests of the Teton Science School and Lost Creek Ranch,
Bright said.
   Meanwhile, a preliminary investigation concluded that a
helicopter involved in firefighting efforts in the Bighorn National
Forest crashed after it lost power to its rear rotor, which
stabilizes the craft. Investigators are unsure why the rotor lost
power, fire information officer Harvalou Buchanan said.
   Last Friday's crash killed Merrin Rodgers, 51, a Bureau of Land
Management communications technician, and injured the pilot and two
other passengers.
   Officials in Montana took advantage of the calmer, cooler
weather to have crews dig a fire line by hand in rugged terrain
along the southern edge of the 13-day-old Warm Springs Creek fire,
southeast of Helena.
   ``They'll be right at the burning edge,'' fire information
officer Bob Krepps said Monday. He said the 37,200-acre fire was
only smoldering there Monday, allowing crews to go in with less
risk.
   Officials predicted the fire would be contained Tuesday night.
   Elsewhere in Montana, 20 smokejumpers parachuted into the Storm
Creek fire that has burned 22,000 acres of the Absaroka-Beartooth
Wilderness, and 80 more were to be taken in by four-wheel drive
vehicles, said Beartooth District Ranger Phil Jaquith. The fire
raced eight miles in a matter of hours Saturday, kicked up by high
wind, he said.
   The Hellroaring Creek fire, in a different section of the same
giant wilderness area northeast of Yellowstone National Park, had
covered an estimated 24,400 acres by Monday. Spokeswoman Maggie
Pittman said about 360 firefighters were working on the blaze,
which officials hope will burn into natural barriers.
   In southeastern Montana, officials called for reinforcements to
help battle a blaze out of control south of the Northern Cheyenne
Indian Reservation. Don Kendall of the Department of State Lands
said the Kirby fire _ fanned by wind blowing at 35 to 40 mph _ had
grown to 10,000 to 12,000 acres, but firefighters expected to
contain the blaze Tuesday.

<HEAD>Reports Up To 710 Soviets Killed In Afghan Rocket Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British newspaper said Tuesday up to 710 Soviet
soldiers and civilians were killed in a rocket attack by Afghan
rebels on a military base north of Kabul, the capital of
Afghanistan.
   The Daily Telegraph said its account of the rocket assault, that
occurred either Aug. 10 or 11, was based on reports received in
Peshawar, Pakistan, from Afghan guerrillas.
   Earlier reports had surfaced from diplomatic and guerrilla
sources of the attack on the Kalagay military base 100 miles north
of Kabul, but they had few details and a lower death toll.
   Daily Telegraph correspondent James Bone in Peshawar reported a
spokesman for a guerrilla group said the rockets devastated the
Kalagay ammunition depot and turned the Soviet compound into an
inferno.
   Bone quoted the spokesman, who was not identified, as saying,
``Maybe it was lucky but it was a good hit and our greatest day.''
   Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad had said at least 109
Soviet soldiers died at Kalagay.
   Bone said the casualties were much higher according to a report
written on cloth by Muhibullah Khan, a guerrilla commander in the
Kalagay district, and received in Peshawar.
   Bone said Muhibullah Khan's report quoted a leader of the
government militia as saying 598 Soviet soldiers and 112 Soviet
civilians were killed and 284 Soviets were wounded. He wrote that
the report said the guerrillas fired eight 107mm rockets into the
supply base.
   Western reporters generally are barred from Afghanistan and
there was no independent confirmation of conflicting claims by the
government and guerrillas.
   If the report attributed to Muhibullah Khan was accurate, it
would be possibly the worst single loss by Soviet forces since they
entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the Marxist government
battle the rebels.
   Under an accord signed by Afghanistan and Pakistan with Soviet
participation last April, all Soviet military personnesl are to be
withdrawn from Afghanistan by Feb. 15. The Soviet Union had up to
115,000 troopers in the country but announced that half of the
force had been removed as of Aug. 15 according to the withdrawal
schedule.
   The anti-communist guerrillas did not participate in the peace
negotiations and have vowed to continue their fight.

   Hurricane forecasters Monday were tracking three
tropical depressions, the closest one expected to gradually
strengthen as it moves into the western Caribbean.
   The newest tropical depression formed Monday in the middle
Atlantic Ocean, east of the Lesser Antilles. The westward-moving
system's highest sustained winds were near 35 mph around a center
roughly 325 miles east of the island of Guadeloupe, the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables reported at 10:30 p.m.
Monday. The depression was moving about 20 to 25 mph.
   An Air Force reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled to
investigate the depression Tuesday morning.
   Forecasters were most concerned with the Caribbean depression,
which was moving west-northwest at about at about 15 to 20 mph and
had highest sustained winds of near 35 mph, the hurricane center
said. The poorly organized depression was about 175 miles southeast
of Kingston, Jamaica.
   ``The one in the Caribbean probably has the best potential,''
said forecaster Bob Case. ``Once it moves into the western
Caribbean, it seems more favorable for development.''
   Some strengthening was expected over the next 24 hours, Case
said Monday.
   ``Any time there's a tropical depression southeast of us at this
time of year, you need to pay attention,'' Case added.
   Of the tropical activity, Case said it was ``quite normal'' at
this point in the hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends
Nov. 30.
   ``We're really approaching the peak of the season,'' he said.
   Little strengthening was expected in the newly formed depression
unless it slowed its forward speed, Case said.
   Meanwhile, the most distant system, located about 200 miles
northwest of Santo Antao in the Cape Verde Islands off west Africa,
was moving northwest at 15 to 20 mph into colder water, and little
change in strength was expected until a gradual decrease late
Tuesday. Its highest sustained winds were estimated near 35 mph.
   Depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74
mph. There have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988
Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane
strength.

   Sen. Dan Quayle told a veterans group Monday
``absolutely no influence was used'' to get him into the Indiana
National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War.
   In brief remarks to a convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars
in Chicago, the Republican vice presidential nominee: ``Influence
was not even necessary if I had chosen to use it, which I never
would have.
   ``The reason is because my Indiana National Guard unit had
openings before I applied, they had openings when I applied, and
they had openings after I applied. So there was absolutedly no
influence used.''
   The crowd of about 2,500 veterans cheered and whistled turing
the hastily called appearance, in which the Indiana senator joked:
   ``My national guard unit was never called up to active duty, but
let me say that after these last 72 hours no one can say I've never
faced combat.''
   Presidential nominee George Bush and his aides have sought to
play down suggestions that Quayle's candidacy needed shoring up
after a rocky week dominated by the controversy over whether
Quayle, a pro-military conservative on Capitol Hill, pulled strings
to enter the National Guard in 1969 as his college draft deferment
was about to end.
   In a report in Tuesday's editions of The Washington Post, the
guard official who swore in Quayle said he received no special
treatment. Retired major general Alfred F. Ahner said in a
telephone interview that ``there had to have been a vacancy before
he enlisted.''
   The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported, however, that records
show the guard under a virtual freeze on recruitment imposed 49
days before Quayle's enlistment on May 19, 1969.
   The documents also appear to contradict assertions from some
former Indiana Guard officers that the Guard had more than 200
vacancies and therefore was open to Quayle without special
treatment or favoritism, the story said.
   At the VFW conference, where Bush had appeared earlier Monday,
Quayle also said he hoped to put the issue of his military record
behind him so attention could be focused on ``the real issues'' of
the campaign.
   ``The question before all of us is: Not what Dan Quayle did 20
years in the past _ but what either President Bush or President
Dukakis will do in the future to secure world peace,'' Quayle said.
   The circumstances surrounding Quayle's unplanned, last-minute
appearance before the veterans group were in dispute. Wade LaDue,
the spokesman for the organization, said Quayle was invited Monday
after Illinois Gov. James Thompson intervened with Commander in
Chief Earl Stock.
   Thompson is a key Bush supporter in Illinois. Quayle press
secretary David Prosperi said Stock made the invitation. Kevin
Morris, communications director for the Bush campaign in Illinois,
said members of the VFW encouraged Thompson to persuade Quayle to
appear.
   Quayle flew back to the nation's capital Sunday, accompanied by
James A. Baker III, Bush's campaign chairman and top strategist, to
meet with the new campaign staff assembled for him by Bush aides.
   Bush departed from his prepared remarks to a Veterans of Foreign
Wars convention in Chicago on Monday to defend his running mate:
   ``Dan Quayle served in the National Guard, signing up in a unit
that had vacancies at the time and now he is under shrill partisan
attack,'' Bush said, his voice rising. ``So let his attackers cast
the first stone. He served honorably. True, he didn't go to
Vietnam, but his unit wasn't sent.
   ``But there's another truth _ he did not go to Canada, he did
not burn his draft card and he damned sure didn't burn the American
flag,'' Bush said, drawing cheers and a standing ovation from the
veterans.
   Quayle is scheduled to return to the campaign trail Wednesday,
certain to face more questions about the Guard issue and how he got
into law school when he did not meet admission requirements.
   He is to attend legislative conferences in Cincinnati and
Lexington, Ky., before traveling to St. Louis, where aides say he
will deliver a major address to the Enlisted Association of the
National Guard, composed of current and former enlisted personnel.
   Meanwhile, Newsweek magazine reported that during his 1980
Senate campaign, Quayle referred to himself in political pamphlets
as a ``Vietnam-era veteran.'' Quayle dropped the reference after
objections by some Vietnam combat veterans. Although the reference
was technically correct, Newsweek said that his National Guard duty
was not the type of service implied in the leaflet.
   In the interview, Quayle also said his influential family didn't
pull strings to get him admitted to Indiana University Law School.
   The staff that the Bush campaign has assembled for Quayle is a
group with substantial experience in the White House and
presidential politics.
   Stuart Spencer, a longtime Reagan adviser and member of the
president's ``kitchen cabinet,'' is chairing Quayle's campaign. His
deputy is Joseph Canzeri, known as an expert detail man during his
years in the Reagan White House.
   Spencer, long a Reagan intimate, is a savvy strategist who has
been at Reagan's side in most of his political decisions.
   Canzeri served Nelson Rockefeller, titan of the Republican
Party's moderate wing, for nearly 20 years. A presidential
assistant and deputy to Reagan aide Michael Deaver, Canzeri was
known as a Mr. Fixit in the White House for his quick humor and
ability to get things done.
   Canzeri resigned in 1982 under a cloud after accepting mortgages
from friends at favorable interest rates and double-billing the
White House and the Republican National Committee for ``$700 and
change'' for two dinners he gave while out of the country preparing
for presidential trips. The Justice Department later concluded that
Canzeri did not violate federal law.
   Quayle's press secretary, Prosperi, was Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel's spokesman and also worked at the Reagan White House.

<TEXT>
   Actress Valerie Harper denied from the
witness stand Monday that she demanded absolute control over the TV
series she was fired from, declaring, ``I wasn't trying to be
Genghis Khan.''
   ``I wanted to have participation, early knowledge of stories so
I would be in a partnership on the show,'' she said of her
situation comedy series ``Valerie.''
   Ms. Harper was called to the stand by attorneys for Lorimar, the
production company suing her for alleged breach of contract. She is
countersuing the company, contending it wrongfully fired her from
the show.
   Attorney Donald Engel sought to show that Ms. Harper was aware
of all aspects of her 1985 contract with Lorimar and tried to
renegotiate it because she craved more money and total control over
all aspects of the show.
   Ms. Harper denied this, saying that she left business matters in
the hands of her husband, Tony Cacciotti, and left the contract to
her agent and lawyer whose advice she later came to doubt.
   ``I'm not good with contracts,'' she said, holding the Lorimar
document. ``I read these and start to get cross-eyed.''
   Ms. Harper acknowledged that even before the pilot for
``Valerie'' was sold, her relations with other members of the
production staff began to erode.
   The first problem, she said, arose when Cacciotti's name was
left off the list of credits on the pilot for ``Valerie'' even
though he had acted as supervising producer.
   ``I was disappointed and hurt,'' she said. ``It felt like a
betrayal.''
   She told jurors that she and Cacciotti have been business
partners since 1979 and have been married just over a year.
   Engel enumerated the financial terms of the contract that
brought Ms. Harper $1.5 million for the first one-and-a-half
seasons on the air and provided profit shares and escalating
salaries for her and her husband in subsequent years. In the sixth
season, she would have received $90,000 per episode.
   ``Didn't you realize that you had a very favorable deal?'' asked
Engel.
   ``I felt financially it was a start,'' Ms. Harper replied.
   She faulted herself for letting too many unwritten agreements
stay out of the contract.
   ``There was a rush to sign the contract and (they said) we'll
work out the details later,'' she said.
   Ms. Harper said, she sought to renegotiate her contract later to
increase her salary and put in writing her creative participation
in story ideas for each episode.
   By then, she conceded, she felt she was losing the right to
affect story lines.
   ``The consultation I had enjoyed had eroded and the relationship
with (the producers) had started to turn,'' she said.
   ``What you thought you had was total control,'' said Engel.
   ``I would disagree,'' said Ms. Harper. ``I wanted participation,
not control....I wasn't trying to be Genghis Khan. I wanted
participation with people I loved and respected.''
   Lorimar fired Ms. Harper from the show a year ago and replaced
her with Sandy Duncan. The show is now known as ``The Hogan
Family.''
   Ms. Harper's testimony came on her 48th birthday, but the event
was not mentioned in the courtroom.

<TEXT>
   The basement warren called The Hole where fire
claimed seven lives is one of hundreds of illegal ``social clubs''
dotting the city's poorer neighborhoods that continue to operate
despite repeated police raids.
   More than 30 people were injured in the fire at the Bronx club
Sunday afternoon as 60 to 100 panicked patrons tried to escape
through the lone exit.
   Despite periodic campaigns to close them down, social clubs _ a
local term everyone admits is misleading _ have been centers of
urban problems ranging from noise and double-parking to gambling,
prostitution and drug dealing.
   Police had raided The Hole five times since March to try to shut
it down.
   Rife with building, health and fire code violations, the clubs
repeatedly have been the scene of serious fires, including one in
Brooklyn three years ago that killed five people.
   Such clubs are common in large cities. In 1967 a police raid on
an illegal club in Detroit _ ``blind pig'' was the local term _
sparked days of rioting.
   In New York City, alcohol is sold without a license at more than
200 locations, according to estimates by police precinct
commanders. Clubs have operated in the past at another 400
locations and could reopen any time.
   Some were closed under the city's ``padlock law,'' which allows
police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are committed
on the site within a 12-month period.
   But police have been unable to close many other clubs. The Hole,
first raided in May 1984, is a prime example.
   Police hit the club five times between March 22 and July 26,
seizing cash and liquor and arresting a total of nine people, most
of them employees charged with selling liquor without a state
license. But the club never stayed closed because the police
couldn't get even the two criminal convictions needed under the
padlock law.
   When the fire broke out Sunday most of the cases were still
plodding through the city's overloaded court system. In the three
that were resolved, defendants were allowed to plead guilty to
disorderly conduct and pay fines of between $50 and $100.
   ``That is useless to us,'' said Deputy Inspector Frank Biehler,
because disorderly conduct does not qualify as a criminal
conviction under the padlock law.
   The fines were particularly puny compared to those prescribed
for violations of the liquor law _ about $10,000 each.
   Despite the label, places like The Hole are neither social nor
clubs.
   ``The consumption of alcohol is often of secondary importance,''
a state task force report said. ``The primary function of these
operations has developed into prostitution, gambling, drugs and
trafficking in stolen property.''
   City police have made 1,128 arrests at clubs in the past 12
months.
   New York State liquor licenses cost up to $5,100 and are good
for three years. But many people do not apply for one, often
because they have a criminal record or plan to employ others who do.
   Also, if a bar is not licensed it doesn't have to worry about
state inspectors ``coming in and seeing things they don't want
seen,'' said Richard Chernela, spokesman for the state Liquor
Authority.
   Just about anyone can go to a social club, despite the term's
implication of exclusivity. An employee usually keeps an eye on the
door, but a club member is generally anyone who walks in on a given
night.
   Or morning. While the city's licensed bars are required to close
by 4 a.m., social clubs often are open until dawn or later, usually
to the distress of neighborhood residents.
   When the police do stage a raid, securing evidence is
problematic. ``When we come in, a lot of things hit the floor and
go down the toilet,'' Biehler said.
   Owners are rarely convicted. ``When you arrest a bartender, you
haven't arrested the guy who's really calling the shots, and so the
place is back in business with a new bartender the next day,''
Chernela said.
   ``After a tragedy like this everyone looks at the government,
but it's a very difficult problem,'' said Chernela. ``You close
them and they just spring back up.''

<HEAD>Wickes `White Knight' Sigoloff Makes Leveraged Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sanford C. Sigoloff, the corporate
``White Knight'' who rescued Wickes Cos. Inc. from bankruptcy five
years ago, on Sunday announced a management-led leveraged buyout
offer of $12 a share.
   The retail giant, including the Builder's Emporium and Wickes
Furniture stores, also announced a net loss of $12.4 million for
the second quarter ended July 30, said company spokesman Michael
Sitrick.
   Sigoloff disclosed that WII Holdings Corp., a firm he
established with members of his Wickes management team, will offer
to purchase nearly 40 million shares of outstanding common stock,
Sitrick said. He said WII stands for W-2 or Wickes 2.
   The offer is nearly $3 higher than Wickes' closing stock price
of 9] on the New York Stock Exchange last Friday.
   ``While I have strong confidence in the long-term viability and
prospects of our continuing businesses,'' Sigoloff said in a
prepared statement, ``it has become increasingly clear to me, as
well as the other directors of the company, that our stockholders
want to maximize the value of their investment in the company in
the immediate near-term.''
   The 39,846,600 shares sought in the merger deal represent about
83 percent of Wickes' outstanding shares, Sitrick said.
   The offer is scheduled to be in effect from Aug. 26 to Oct. 20,
he said.
   It is expected that the principal investors in WII Holdings will
be institutional investors, including Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
which promised no problems in arranging financing for the buyout,
Sitrick said.
   The offer is void if fewer than 50 percent of outstanding shares
are sold, he said.
   The company's net loss for the second quarter amounted to 28
cents a share, with reported earnings of $10.4 million, or 19 cents
a share, on sales of $937.9 million and losses from discontinued
operation of $22.8 million, or 47 cents a share.
   In April 1982, Wickes, with assets estimated at about $3
billion, became the largest U.S. company to file for bankruptcy
protection. But less than two years later, creditors approved a
plan allowing Wickes to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings.
   Analysts had predicted it would take Wickes at least five years
to erase the accumulated red ink.
   The force behind the comeback was Sigoloff, who earned the
nickname ``Ming the Merciless'' for the tough-minded business moves
and hard-nosed cost cutting he employed to resuscitate two other
Los Angeles companies in the 1970s: Republic Corp. and Daylin Inc.
   Sigoloff reorganized Wickes by selling off seasonal divisions
such as MacGregor Golf and Wickes Agriculture. At the same time he
revamped store displays and appeared in television commercials and
offered his personal guarantee of renewed product quality and
service.

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Heng Samrin of Cambodia has
retired or shifted 11 members of his Cabinet and abolished the
office of cooperation with Soviet bloc allies, state-run radio said.
   The radio report, seen Sunday in Bangkok, said the reshuffle
included the key portfolios of defense and interior. No reason was
given for the changes.
   The moves were made Saturday at ``an ordinary meeting of the
Council of State in the presence of Comrade Heng Samrin, chairman
of the Council of State,'' the broadcast said.
   Vietnam installed the Heng Samrin government when it invaded
Cambodia in late 1978. The United Nations recognizes as Cambodia's
legitimate government a coalition of three guerrilla groups
fighting the Vietnamese occupation.
   ``It is decided to dissolve the office of the minister of
economic and cultural cooperation with Vietnam, Laos, the Soviet
Union, and other fraternal socialist countries,'' the radio said.
   The Soviet-backed Vietnamese have pledged to withdraw by early
1990 the up to 100,000 troops they maintain in Cambodia.

<HEAD>British Arms Sales Boom: From Bullets To Jet Fighters
^An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain is booming as an arms dealer, supplanting
the United States as wealthy Saudi Arabia's biggest supplier and
edging out long-time rival France globally as purveyor of
everything from bullets to jet fighters.
   Less particular than the United States about who buys its
increasingly sophisticated wares, Britain has doubled its sales in
the past three years through a mixture of politics, hard-sell and
technical advances.
   The most glittering prize is a $17 billion deal clinched last
month with Saudi Arabia that includes 50 Tornado fighter-bombers.
   It underlines Britain's major advantage over the United States:
there are no political constraints on British arms sales to
Israel's Arab enemies.
   ``The number of restrictions the United States has on sales is
preposterous,'' says Francis Tusa, analyst at the London-based
Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies.
   ``The Saudis have made it clear that they are not going to be
told any longer by the U.S. Congress, `You can have what you want _
but only a third of it and not for another five years and providing
you don't base it where you want to','' he said in an interview.
   With the ink just dry on the Saudi deal, Defense Secretary
George Younger was back in the Middle East, this time in Kuwait,
talking arms. About the same time, the U.S. Senate blocked the sale
of Maverick air-to-surface missiles that were to accompany 40
American F-18 fighters Kuwait had agreed to buy, throwing doubt on
the near $2 billion deal.
   ``Our friends and friendly rivals have their problems,''
acknowledged an official of the Defense Ministry's Defense Exports
Services Organization, requesting anonymity.
   With a staff of 250, the organization's main job is to oil the
wheels of sales drives by privately owned British armament
manufacturers, such as the airplane giant British Aerospace, and
also check that they don't sell to banned countries.
   These include South Africa, Syria, Libya and Israel, which is
officially under a British arms embargo since the 1982 invasion of
Lebanon.
   According to Defense Ministry figures, between 1985 and 1987
Britain doubled to 12 percent its share of the world arms market
outside the East bloc.
   Britain, the Defense Ministry says, is now the world's third
largest arms supplier, ranking well behind the United States _
``Washington probably gives away more than we sell worldwide,''
said one official _ and the Soviet Union, but pushing France down
to fourth place.
   Britain signed defense contracts worth $4 billion in 1985. In
1986, the figure was nearly $9 billion with a first major Saudi
contract to buy Tornado planes, and last year contracts totaled an
estimated $5.6 billion.
   Defense Export Services Organization chief Sir Colin Chandler,
who received a knighthood this year on Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's recommendation, says Britain's 1987 figure keeps it
ahead of France.
   In 1986, with the Saudi deal, Britain moved temporarily into
second place, ahead of the Soviet Union.
   Mrs. Thatcher has assiduously cultivated the oil-rich Saudis on
official visits and rolled out the red carpet for King Fahd in
London.
   She slips in plugs for British armaments during foreign trips,
including recently in Canada, where Britain and France are
competing for a multimillion-dollar order for nuclear-powered
submarines.
   British officials, arms manufacturers and some analysts say
prime factors in the increased sales are improved weapons and
warplanes, including the multinational Tornado developed with West
Germany and Italy, and the free-enterprise atmosphere generated by
nearly a decade of Thatcher government.
   ``It is a fact that we're producing more things with fewer
people,'' said a British official, adding the 130,000-strong
workforce in the defense industry has declined slightly in the past
few years. He requested anonymity.
   Others familiar with the secretive world of arms sales say
France has also been hurt by a tradition of gearing arms exports to
Third World countries on generous credit terms.
   Philip Parker, marketing director for Plessey, one of five
British defense electronics manufacturers, said that with Britain
cutting defense spending, companies are forced to expand foreign
sales.
   ``We have to go and slug it out in the market place in the major
countries,'' said Parker in an interview.
   Plessey says its annual turnover from defense sales has more
than trebled to $850 million since 1980, with sonar systems going
to the Swedish, Thai and South Korean navies, an $850 million
communications network for the Australian army, and smaller deals
with Oman, New Zealand, Greece and an unidentified Far Eastern
country.
   But British manufacturers have suffered some big failures too.
   The most expensive was the scrapping of the Nimrod spy plane in
1986, after nine years' work by Britain's General Electric Company
costing nearly $1.7 billion. Britain ordered the U.S. Boeing
Airborne Warning and Command System instead.

   Aron, a nephew of the late French philosopher Raymond Aron,

produced plays and wrote for the newspapers Le Matin and Le Monde.
   In a recent interview on French television, Aron said he felt an

   Soldiers manned barricades in Burma's
capital Monday and most shops were closed as merchants heeded
student calls for a nationwide strike to demand a return to
democracy, Kyodo news service said.
   The general strike was expected to be a test for President Maung
Maung, who came to power Friday and is Burma's first civilian
leader in the 26 years since a military coup replaced democracy
with one-party rule.
   A messenger representing student groups, defying an 8 p.m. to 4
a.m. curfew, ran through residential areas of Rangoon to rally
support for the strike, the Japanese news agency reported from the
Burmese capital.
   Soldiers stood at major points in the center of Rangoon, where
barbed wire barricades had been erected to guard against
demonstrators, Kyodo said, adding that people were seen cutting
palm trees on the roads to set up barricades against the military.
   The report quoted unidentified sources as saying a large number
of demonstrators rode trucks into the capital on Sunday night.
   An Asian diplomat in Rangoon said the city was ``relatively
quiet'' Monday morning.
   For the sixth straight day Sunday, authorities released people
arrested in Rangoon during Aug. 8-12 riots that prompted the
resignation of Maung Maung's predecessor, Sein Lwin, after only 17
days in power. Troops fired into crowds of demonstrators in the
riots, and the government said 112 people were killed.
   Official Radio Rangoon said 100 people were freed Sunday,
bringing the total reported released in Rangoon to 408. Thousands
of people are still believed detained.
   On Saturday, people demonstrated peacefully in Mandalay, Burma's
second-largest city, and in five other towns, according to Radio
Rangoon.
   The state-run newspaper Working People's Daily reported Saturday
that during the Aug. 8-12 protests, hysterical mobs decapitated at
least five people, including three police officers, in the Rangoon
suburb of North Okkalapa.
   ``Two of the (policemen's) heads were stuck on bamboo poles and
one was put on a stool for all to see,'' according to the
newspaper, obtained Sunday from a Western embassy in Bangkok. The
report said the protesters then burned the bodies.
   One of the victims was a civilian mistaken for an intelligence
agent and beheaded after a mob stoned him to death, it said.
   ``The leader of the demonstration in North Okkalapa township
wore a hood to hide his face as he screamed at the top of his voice
for the emergence of the `Aung Gyi government,''' the newspaper
said.
   Aung Gyi, the country's leading dissident, was arrested with
several other prominent figures July 29-30. Among those seized was
Sein Win, the Burma correspondent of The Associated Press.
   The wave of turmoil in Burma began July 27, when leader Ne Win
resigned and Sein Lwin came to power. A retired army general, Sein
Lwin was widely hated for ruthlessly suppressing dissent, and
disturbances began almost immediately.
   At first peaceful, the demonstrations became violent on Aug. 8
and security personnel fired shots to disperse the crowds. Some
protesters fought back and the government said 112 people were
killed and 267 wounded in Rangoon. Diplomats there believe hundreds
may have been killed.
   The violence continued until Aug. 12, when Sein Lwin resigned.
But smaller, student-led protests continued almost daily to press
for an end to one-party rule and for economic reforms.
   The Asian diplomat said the government was unlikely to agree to
multi-party democracy after a quarter-century of iron-fisted
control by the Burma Socialist Program Party, founded by Gen. Ne
Win. The general led the March 2, 1962, coup that toppled the
elected government of Prime Minister U Nu.
   Burmese media also have rejected the idea of returning to a
multi-party system, noting in recent days that the government
during Burma's 14 years of democracy was corrupt and inefficient.
But officials have said in recent days that the current government
also is corrupt.
   A Western diplomat, who asked for anonymity, said Saturday that
Maung Maung has remained silent on the issue. The president did not
flatly reject democracy in his speech Friday before the emergency
party session that elected him.

   It's been two decades but fans still go ape for
the Monkees _the musicians, not the primates.
   A new generation of fans gathered by the thousands this weekend
to pay homage to the group at the 1988 Official Monkees Convention.

the madcap Monkees.
   ``I have a crush on Mike (Nesmith) because he's the strong,
silent type.''
   The band, which had six Top 10 hits during the series that ran
from 1966 to 1968, is enjoying a revival of its show on cable
television.
   ``I'm closer in spirit to their ages now,'' guitarist Peter
Tork, 46, said Saturday before performing at convention. ``I
thought I was older then.''
   Tork was joined by fellow Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones at
the convention, but Nesmith declined to attend.

Styron questioned whether awards and medals might actually hinder
an artist's progress.
   ``It's hard to believe that medals and honors might have
improved the quality of the work of our literary ancestors,''
Styron said, noting that Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne,
Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman never received awards.
   ``The immense and fomented loneliness of the writers of that
time ... makes it plausible to think they might have been violated,
perhaps irreparably, had that loneliness been intruded upon by
anxiety over winning a prize,'' he said.

   New York Yankees star Don Mattingly says he's
disillusioned with this season and indirectly blamed owner George
Steinbrenner for the team's recent fade in the American League East.
   ``The players get no respect around here. They give you money,
that's it. Not respect. Money is not respect,'' Mattingly said
Sunday after a 4-2 loss to Seattle.
   The Yankees, who held first place from May 3 to June 19, have
lost three in a row and nine of 13. They fell six games behind
division-leading Detroit, their biggest deficit this season.
   When Mattingly signed a three-year contract last spring, he
``guaranteed'' this would be the Yankees' year. The Yankees have
not won the division since 1981.
   At midseason, Steinbrenner criticized Mattingly for not
producing enough. Steinbrenner also blasted Yankee stars Rickey
Henderson and Dave Winfield.
   ``You can't get beaten over the head every day and want to play.
It's hard to come to the ballpark every day when you're unhappy,''
Mattingly said.

   Bruce Kimball's determined bid for a return
trip to the Olympics ended with tears, hugs and happiness for a
group that protested the possibility of him representing the United
States next month.
   Kimball, an Olympic silver medalist in 1984, finished fourth
Sunday in his best event _ the 10-meter platform _ after earlier
finishing sixth in springboard at the U.S. Olympic diving trials.
   At an emotional news conference, Kimball announced last week he
would compete despite facing charges in connection with an Aug. 1
auto accident in which two people were killed and six were injured.
   Kimball is free on $10,000 bond and charged with five felony
counts of driving under the influence pending his Aug. 29
arraignment.
   ``I just gave him a hug and told him I loved him and told him I
was proud of him,'' said his father, Dick Kimball, a veteran
Olympic coach.
   The elder Kimball, however, will make the trip to Seoul to coach
Wendy Lucero, one of his divers who qualified in the women's
springboard event.

   Douglas Hoylman spent much of the weekend
puzzling down and across before coming up as winner of the 11th
Annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament.
   Hoylman, of Chevy Chase, Md., took 10 minutes and 44 seconds to
perfectly fill in a crossword puzzle Sunday at the competition that
drew puzzle aces from around the country, according to tournament
director Will Shortz.
   The three finalists from a field of 136 reached the playoff
round after scoring points on accuracy and speed in earlier rounds.
Hoylman's first-place efforts won him $500.
   Second place finisher was Jon Delfin, a pianist from New York
City, who clocked 13 minutes and 4 seconds to finish the puzzle
without an error.
   Ellen Ripstein of New York scored the best time of 7 minutes 19
seconds, but she had one error.
   Shortz said the final puzzle was very difficult and offered some
examples: ``One clue was `court pronouncement' which make you think
about the legal area but the answer actually was `game, set and
match' in the tennis court.''
   Another clue was the state in which you might see stars.
   ``It's supposed to make you thnk about California, but the anwer
was `senseless,''' he said.
   The competition was sponsored by the publishers of the New York
Herald Tribune Crosswords magazines.

   Supermarket checker Vicki McClure says she's
glad her moment in the spotlight as solo singer at the opening of
the 1984 Olympic Summer Games didn't catapult her to instant
success.
   ``I'm not disappointed for what has happened because being
thrust in at that level with my inexperience would have been a
mistake,'' McClure said.
   ``I really wouldn't have had an inkling of how to handle it.''
   Still, she has fond memories of the grand event four years ago.
   ``It was the most spectacular moment. It was bigger than life,''
she said recently. ``It was a really magical experience.''
   Ms. McClure sang the hit, ``Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's
Hand)'' at the opening ceremonies of the 1984 Olympics at Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
   The $7 million opening ceremony had a cast of thousands and was
staged before a capacity crowd of 90,000 and an international
television audience.
   The show included a 1,000-voice choir, a 750-piece marching
band, a 100-piece symphony orchestra, 7,500 athletes and 2,500
pigeons.
   Ms. McClure, who was 30 at the time, appeared as the lead singer
in the Los Angeles Jazz Choir, a position originally intended for a
star of the caliber of Diana Ross.
   But after Olympics officials heard her sing, they chose her to
perform because they liked the idea of having an unknown singer.
``It was kind of in keeping with the amateur spirit of the
Olympics,'' she said.
   Ms. McClure said she is happy working as a professional singer,
performing at banquets and ceremonies and with the group Daddy's
Money, which performs nostalgic and rhythm and blues songs.
   ``I haven't really done a Vicki McClure act as of yet,'' she
said. ``I'm still looking for a repertoire. It's hard to find
material you're comfortable with by yourself.''

   U.S. military personnel are reporting
increased harassment by local officials, but there is no indication
the actions are part of a new campaign by the government of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, U.S. authorities said Sunday.
   Cynthia Farrell, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy, said the
incidents involved harassment, ``not attacks.''
   Noriega is commander of Panama's Defense Forces and controls the
civilian government. He was indicted in February by two grand
juries in Florida on drug trafficking charges and the United States
has imposed economic sanctions in an effort to force him to resign
and leave Panama.
   A statement by the Defense Forces late Sunday called the
accusations of harassment part of a campaign of disinformation in
an effort to destabilize Panama and listed numerous allegations of
misconduct by U.S. forces in Panama.
   Ms. Farrell said the reports of harassment are coming only from
U.S. military personnel.
   ``Civilians, business people and embassy personnel have reported
no increase in harassment,'' she said. She added she did not know
if U.S. military personnel are being bothered more or are ``simply
reporting more cases.''
   An official at the U.S. Southern Command in Panama, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said 240 cases of harassment had been
reported between February and August of this year.
   He said incidents of harassment have increased in number and
gravity but denied reports the incidents were being considered
attacks.
   ``What's going on these days has been going on for months _
going way back to last year,'' the official said. ``If there was an
increase, it probably came in January, February, March and April,
not in the last month or two.''
   ``One of the things that's happening is that a lot of people are
being asked for bribes when they're stopped for traffic violations,
and that's probably because the police aren't getting paid
regularly'' the official said.
   Panama's economy has been damaged by the U.S. sanctions.
   The Southern Command official said a more serious incident
occurred last week when Panamanian Defense Forces officers refused
to let U.S. military vehicles pick up mail for three days at Panama
City's international airport. The dispute was resolved after three
days, the official said, but he did not elaborate.
   The New York Times on Sunday quoted U.S. Southern Command, State
and Defense Department officials as saying there have been an
increasing number of beatings, abductions, rape and extortion of
U.S. military personnel and their dependents in Panama.
   The story, under a Washington dateline, said the U.S. officials
view the incidents as a campaign by Noriega to pressure the United
States to lift economic sanctions against Panama.
   The Defense Forces statement said: ``The supposed U.S.
government officials (cited by the Times) must have the IQ of a
3-year-old Cro-Magnon when they assert that actions taken by the
Panama Defense Forces against U.S. military personnel are attempts
to force the Reagan administration to lift or soften economic
sanctions imposed on Panama.''
   The statement said U.S. troops cause daily problems for
Panamanian authorities, including fights, mistreatment of women,
venereal disease, shooting in public places and refusing to pay bar
and restaurant tabs.
   Washington imposed economic sanctions on Panama in March after
the Noriega ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Delvalle has since been in hiding, but the United States
continues to recognize him as Panama's legitimate president.
   About 12,000 U.S. servicemen are stationed in Panama by treaty
to protect the Panama Canal, a vital waterway linking the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans. They are attached to the Southern Command,
which is in charge of all U.S. military operations south of the
U.S.-Mexico border.
   The first Southern Command official reached by The Associated
Press acknowledged several specific incidents reported by the
Times, including a case in June in which an enlisted man and his
wife were assaulted at gunpoint by a man described as a Panamanian
military officer.
   The assailant forced the enlisted man into the trunk of his car,
then beat and raped his wife.
   ``The individual was dressed in a camouflaged uniform, but he
could have been military, paramilitary, a civilian guard or just
some guy who knows somebody in the PDF (Panamanian Defense Forces)
and somehow managed to get himself a uniform,'' said the Southern
Command official. ``As far as I know, we don't have a definite
description or identification.''

   A House panel says the Veterans Administration
made numerous errors as it hurriedly processed disability claims
but had time to give special treatment to applicants who ``had the
ear'' of influential lawmakers.
   A House Government Operations Committee report, released Sunday,
described two separate systems for handling claims.
   Applicants without ``pull'' had their cases rushed to judgment
by error-prone managers trying to win pay bonuses for meeting
production quotas, the report said.
   But the panel said the Bureau of Veterans Appeals _ the court of
last resort for claimants whose benefits were denied _ ``maintained
a list of congressmen who should be brought to the BVA chairman's
attention if they inquire about an appeal.''
   At a hearing last February by the panel's subcommittee on human
resources, a former appeals board member, Daniel J.B. Bierman, was
asked whether there was preferential treatment when a lawmaker on
the list intervened.
   Bierman replied, ``It is difficult for me to say, but I suspect
that to be the case, sir. Otherwise, there would be no reason for
it (the list).''
   ``The BVA ... showed favoritism to claimants who had the ear of
certain influential members of Congress,'' the committee concluded.
   The VA said in a statement it ``has not been provided with a
copy of the committee's report and is obviously disadvantaged by
the fact that it was released to the media before it came to us. We
intend to review it thoroughly when it is received.''
   VA officials refused to reply to the panel's specific
allegations.
   Addressing the appeals board's quota system, the report said,
``The Board of Veterans Appeals ... was so caught up in an
unreasonable production quota standard, that some members were
deciding cases at the rate of one every eight minutes.''
   The committee noted that earlier this year, the VA ended
production-based bonuses and preferential treatment after both
practices were publicized in subcommittee hearings and challenged
in a lawsuit filed by Vietnam Veterans of America.
   The report suggested that Congress end a 55-year-old prohibition
and allow veterans who are denied benefits to appeal their cases in
federal court. In 1987, veterans won less than 13 percent of the
time under the now-abolished quota system at the VA appeals board.
   The committee said the VA tried to cover up its frequent
mistakes in disability claims by deliberately under-reporting the
error rate to staffers for the human resources subcommittee, headed
by Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.
   The VA approves about $11 billion in disability benefits
annually to 2.5 million veterans, widows and children. While some
veterans were improperly denied benefits under the VA's
error-plagued system, others may have received money to which they
were not entitled, according to committee staffers.
   Nine of the 15 Republicans on the 38-member committee filed
dissenting views disagreeing with the recommendation for court
appeals.
   ``While we share the committee's concerns about ... practices
such as production quotas ... we cannot support the committee's
inference that the (appeals board) does not have the best interests
of the veterans in mind,'' they said.
   The report did not give exact numbers of errors, but cited a
1984 internal study of 1,700 cases by VA lawyer Ronald B. Abrams.
He found:
   _A ``substantive'' error rate of 8.4 percent that led to denial
of claims that should have been approved. This category refers to
mathematical and other factual errors.
   _An 18.2 percent ``judgmental'' error rate, in which the wrong
decision was made even though the data used to render the opinion
were accurate.
   _A ``procedural'' error rate of 21.5 percent, in cases where the
mistake did not affect the final benefit determination.
   The VA, however, gave the subcommittee lower error rates for the
1983-87 period: substantive errors, 1.02 percent to 1.73 percent;
judgmental errors, 1.11 percent to 1.81 percent, and procedural
discrepancies, 3.91 percent to 5.09 percent.
   The VA's quota system was described to the subcommittee earlier
this year by Ernest B. Wright, a member of the Board of Veterans
Appeals, and Bierman.
   ``They testified that BVA members ... had production quotas of
40 cases per week, which if fulfilled, could result in merit pay
increases as high as 5 percent of a member's pay,'' the report said.

   It's 8 o'clock at night and Tiffany Gardner
is lying on a couch, a pillow over her head to block the light and
a telephone pressed to her ear.
   It's a common scene for a 17-year-old whiling away a summer
before senior year in high school.
   But Tiffany is at work and she is speaking to a stranger _ an
unmarried 19-year-old girl who recently had a baby.
   ``Her parents ignored her pregnancy and her boyfriend is away in
the military,'' said the volunteer listener at Teen Line, a
teen-to-teen hotline.
   ``She was just really depressed,'' Tiffany said. ``She wasn't
looking for advice, just someone to listen.''
   In the seven years since Teen Line began, more than 50,000 calls
have come in to people like Tiffany, who was on duty during a
recent night with three other teen listeners and an adult health
care professional.
   The listeners work out of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in an
office where nearly every inch of wall space is covered with
referral numbers to hundreds of service organizations such as
Planned Parenthood, Suicide Prevention, the Department of Child
Services and AIDS information centers.
   ``When teens are in need, no matter what their socio-economic
status, they contact their peers,'' said psychiatrist Dr. Terry D.
Lipton, president of The Center for the Study of Young People in
Groups and co-founder of Teen Line.
   ``They won't talk to school counselors, psychiatrists or
priests, but what they will do is pick up the phone and call a
friend.''
   Teen Line is staffed nightly from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Off-hour
callers can leave a message and their call will be returned by a
teen listener.
   Lipton and Elaine Leader, a senior staff member at Cedar-Sinai's
Department of Psychiatry and program coordinator of Teen Line, say
it is one of the most cost-efficient ways to provide mental health
services to adolescents.
   Most callers are between ages 13-19, although parents sometimes
phone to get a teen-ager's perspective on problems their children
are experiencing, Ms. Leader said.
   Most calls deal with boyfriend-girlfriend problems, but the
listeners often hear from pregnant teens, those seeking sexual
advice, and child-abuse victims.
   From 3 percent to 4 percent of the Teen Line calls are suicidal,
Ms. Leader said.
   The volunteer listeners are carefully screened before being
accepted, then must train 12 weeks before answering a hotline phone.
   The training focuses on developing rapport, crisis intervention,
addictive behaviors, all aspects of sexuality, family problems and
more. The volunteers must attend either a recovery program meeting
such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Overeaters Anonymous, participate
in a Teen Line outreach program in Los Angeles high schools, attend
monthly staff meetings and commit one night per week to the hotline.
   Lipton, Ms. Leader and other adult specialists unaffiliated with
the program have few reservations about allowing teen-agers to take
on the responsibility of suicide calls.
   ``These young people are in that position anyway,'' Lipton said.
``On a daily basis they are in school with kids and peers who
constantly give clues about their own despair.''
   The listeners establish if the caller is suicidal through a
series of questions.
   ``We'll ask them, `Have you ever tried it before? How did you do
it? What kinds of pills were they? Do you have them with you now?'
'' said Andrew Yorra, 17, a high school senior who has been a
listener for the past year.
   The callers are encouraged to telephone as often as they want
but not to establish a relationship with their listener.
   ``In that case, they often need ongoing professional therapy,''
Ms. Leader said.
   Calls are confidential and records are kept only of the caller's
age, sex and type of problem. Listeners try, however, to get abuse
victims to report their cases to the county Department of Child
Services for immediate action.
   The hospital provides the office and phones, and the hotline's
estimated $150,000 in annual costs are covered by individual
donations and corporate grants. Last November, an 800 number was
established for the entire state. Ms. Leader is hoping to expand
the service nationwide.

   The trial of 20 alleged mob associates is
nearing an end after 22 months during which a prosecutor twice
became a father, one defense attorney was elected mayor and another
died.
   The trial, believed to be the longest federal criminal trial in
U.S. history and expected to go to the jury this week, has heard
from 89 witnesses and has produced a 5{-foot-thick file containing
40,000 pages of transcripts and 850 exhibits.
   During the U.S. District Court trial, one defendant attended
court for a time in a hospital bed until his moaning interfered
with the proceedings. One passed out from a too-full bladder.
   One prosecutor became a father twice. A defense attorney who had
been commuting from Florida died of cancer.
   ``It's a nightmare,'' said defense attorney Miles Feinstein.
   The case is United States of America vs. Anthony Accetturo, et
al.
   The 20 reputed members and associates of the Lucchese organized
crime family are charged with racketeering and, variously, loan
sharking, illegal gambling, credit card fraud and drug dealing.
   ``No one imagined when we took this case in November 1986 that
we'd still be here,'' said Michael Critchley, a defense lawyer
whose closing arguments lasted five days.
   Critchley, who leads the defense, represents Michael Taccetta,
charged as the group's New Jersey boss. Accetturo is the reputed
Lucchese family captain who allegedly acted as the ultimate
authority from his home in Hollywood, Fla.
   The group allegedly operated out of the Hole-in-the Wall
luncheonette in Newark, where pictures of Al Capone, Meyer Lansky
and Charles ``Lucky'' Luciano decorated the walls.
   Witnesses testified about kisses of respect for the boss,
``tribute'' payments to mob superiors, ``sit-downs,'' where
disputes were resolved, and visits to hangouts by manicurists to do
the nails of defendants.
   The Administrative Office of the Courts in Washington, D.C.,
says the trial is the longest federal criminal trial ever,
according to courtroom Deputy Clerk Lisa Horton.
   One of the longest trials in history, a state lawsuit in
Belleville, Ill., against a chemical company, ended in 1987 after
3{ years.
   Jurors here have been paid more than $175,000. Court-appointed
attorneys have received an estimated $3 million. The defense
calculates the goverment paid or reimbursed cooperating witnesses
some $300,000.
   That's in addition to the salaries of three prosecutors and an
FBI agent who spent nearly two years full-time on the case, extra
deputy marshals for security and U.S. District Judge Harold A.
Ackerman. Then there's copying costs for a mountain of documents.
   ``Obviously it's been very expensive, but I think it's been very
worthwhile,'' said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr., who came to
the job after the case began.
   ``I don't think anybody would say we can't go after organized
crime just because it's too expensive.''
   Ackerman, almost miraculously, has been able to keep up with his
civil calendar. But he has been removed from the pool of judges
assigned criminal cases, worsening the court's backlog.
   The length has taken its toll on everyone involved.
   ``It's difficult to run a town when you are down here,'' said
Robert L. Brown, a defense attorney who was elected mayor of Orange
in May. ``It has caused a lot of late nights at city hall.''
   ``It's taken a piece out of all of us, not just our practices,
but spiritually and emotionally as well,'' said Feinstein.
   One witness was on the stand for four months. He was among a
half-dozen cooperating witnesses _ many with criminal records _
brought to the stand by prosecutors to tell the group's inside
story.
   The defense seized on the issue, telling the jury not to trust
convicted criminals and liars. The government countered by saying
choir boys wouldn't know the Mafia's inner workings.

   Dan Quayle's rocky entry into big-league
politics, stumbling over questions about his military record that
threaten to overshadow George Bush's campaign, has left the
exuberant young senator bloody but seemingly unbowed.
   Back in the nation's capital to prepare for his first solo
campaign trip Wednesday, the Indiana senator remains adamant that
he is not an embarrassment to Bush, has not considered removing
himself from the ticket, and sees nothing improper in the way he
entered the National Guard at a time when other young men were
marching off to fight in Vietnam.
   But the Republican ticket's public debut at the New Orleans
convention and on a three-day Midwestern campaign swing saw these
extraordinary events:
   _Quayle, asked at a New Orleans news conference about his
reasons for going into the National Guard in 1969, stumbling over
his thoughts and finally declaring: ``I did not know in 1969 that I
would be in this room today, I confess.''
   _Quayle standing in mock attention before a Republican Party
farewell convention breakfast, reciting to the uneasy audience his
name, rank and serial number and proclaiming ``Indiana National
Guard. Six years and proud of it!''
   _Quayle, surrounded by reporters and a raucously partisan crowd
in his hometown of Huntington, Ind., asserting ``I got into the
National Guard fairly'' but acknowledging that he assumed a friend
of his wealthy publishing family made calls on his behalf after
Quayle expressed interest in joining the Guard.
   _Quayle, telling reporters in Cleveland, Ohio that he could not
recall what communications he had with his draft board 20 years ago
but insisting he distinctly remembered having no conversation ``in
the 1980s'' with a Pennsylvania Democrat quoted as saying Quayle
told him he ``rode out'' Vietnam in the Guard.
   _Bush, calling the controversy a ``tempest in a teapot'' and
asserting that his initial campaign swing ``has gone great'' except
for ``this frenzy'' of media interest in Quayle's military record.
   Whether that assessment is accurate remains to be seen.
   Quayle seems likely to continue to have to fight portrayals of
himself as a wealthy young man who spoke in favor of the Vietnam
War but had strings pulled to avoid the draft as his college
student deferment was about to expire.
   Bush, a Navy bomber pilot who saw extensive combat in World War
II, defended his running mate, saying that the Vietnam War years in
which Quayle, now 41, pondered his own military service ``were
different times.''
   As for Quayle being vulnerable in the area of defense, an area
in which Bush has portrayed Michael Dukakis as weak, the vice
president said, ``The difference between the person I'm running
against and my running mate are night and day on defense.''
   Bush aides insist they are happy with how Quayle has handled
himself in publicly answering questions about his military record.
   Quayle himself says he does not feel the issue has overshadowed
Bush.
   But there was a clear change in campaign strategy after Quayle's
outdoor news conference Friday that was piped over a public address
system to Quayle's hometown supporters. Their booing of reporters'
questions and cheering of Quayle's answers helped create a
circus-like atmosphere reminiscent of a Roman gladiatorial bout
while Bush remained out of sight in a holding room.
   That day, on which the ticket opened its first joint campaign
trip in the nation's heartland, Quayle dominated news stories about
the event.
   The next day, Bush took charge, defending his running mate in no
uncertain terms at a joint news conference and declaring that
Quayle's qualifications and background had been examined to his
satisfaction.
   Bush said his aides had to spend a lot of time last week running
down ``rumor after insidious rumor,'' and added that the
controversy ``is behind us.''
   However, some questions may yet need to be answered.
   There have been conflicting reports, for example, on whether
there were vacancies in the Guard at the time Quayle entered or
whether there was a waiting list. Quayle has said he cannot recall
those kinds of details.
   And he has not spelled out publicly the extent of his knowledge
about what calls were made on his behalf or to whom they were made.
A retired Guard official, who is a friend of Quayle's family and
worked for the family newspaper, has said he did contact the Guard
on Quayle's behalf. The commander of the Guard unit to which Quayle
was assigned, however, has said he did not receive a call from
anyone urging Quayle's enlistment.
   Quayle insists that ``no rules were broken'' in the way he
entered the Guard. He says he was willing to serve in Vietnam had
his unit been called up, although he concedes that he was generally
aware the likelihood of that happening was not great.
   Quayle has been angered at implications that he was trying to
avoid the draft, although he has tried to appear unperturbed
throughout the controversy. Over the weekend, Quayle appeared not
to hear some spectators' chants of ``Quayle, who went in your
place?'' or to see signs reading ``This Quayle is a chicken.''
   He seems to be philosophical about the most intense and public
scrutiny of his meteoric political career.
   ``I'm in politics in what they call the big leagues,'' Quayle
says, adding: ``Running for the vice presidency is a definite
honor.''

   Foreign policy is getting very little
attention from the candidates as the campaign gets started. The
Republicans seem to be content to play vaguely on George Bush's
experience, while the Democrats are saying even less.
   Even so, the basic approach of the two parties is becoming
clear. Bush and his running mate, Sen. Daniel Quayle, intend to
sound the traditional conservative themes of a powerful military
structure and keeping a wary eye on the Russians.
   Dukakis and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, are playing
down ideology and playing up ``competence,'' being careful to
strike a skeptical stance on the Soviets while sounding the peace
theme.
   Both sides are bound to get more specific in the 2{ months of
campaigning ahead. It's likely to get sticky. Bush will be
challenged about the Reagan administration's secret arms sale to
Iran while Dukakis' lack of foreign policy experience will be
tested over a wide range of issues.
   Don't look for foreign policy treatises, though. Campaigning for
president in the television age encourages snappy or catchy
one-liners, not a thoughtful exposition of how the candidates stand
on tricky arms control issues, the Arab-Israel dispute, leftist
movements in Central America and apartheid in South Africa.
   Besides, politicians and their managers operate on the theory
the voters are far more concerned with pocketbook issues such as
jobs and inflation than with American foreign policy.
   There have been striking exceptions and mixed results. Franklin
D. Roosevelt ran for a fourth term as president in 1944 while the
United States was still at war. The overriding issue was whether to
take a chance on changing leaders. The voters stuck with Roosevelt.
   In 1972, on the other hand, George McGovern, the Democratic
candidate, ran primarily as an anti-war candidate whose opposition
to American involvement in Vietnam and Cambodia was the central
theme of his futile race against President Richard Nixon.
   The 1988 campaign is just now unfolding, but there is no reason
to believe either the Republicans or Democrats will give that sort
of weight to a single foreign policy issue.
   In fact, the selections of Quayle and Bentsen suggest the
presidential candidates intend to place the focus elsewhere.
   Bush's choice of Quayle is above all a gesture to the GOP's most
conservative elements, while Dukakis chose Bentsen primarily for
his experience in Congress and his ties to conservative Democrats,
especially in Texas.
   In 1960, when Nixon was pondering a running mate for his first
race for the presidency, he assembled 36 party elders at a midnight
meeting in Chicago. The governor of Illinois, William Stratton,
offered this advice: ``You can say all you want about foreign
affairs, but what is really important is the price of hogs in
Chicago.''
   Nixon picked Henry Cabot Lodge, who had served as the U.S.
permanent representative at the United Nations. They lost to John
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, but Nixon's explanation, as recalled by
former Undersecretary of State Warren Christopher, may still be
relevant: ``If you ever let the Democrats campaign only on domestic
issues, they will beat us. Our only hope is to keep it on foreign
policy.''
   That doesn't mean, however, that the candidate has to be an
expert on the pecking order in the Kremlin, the history of the West
Bank or the strengths and weaknesses of the Nicaraguan economy.
   Ronald Reagan won in 1980 without any experience in foreign
affairs. He lacked the background to be specific about foreign
policy issues. But he had a well-developed image of opposing
communism, and he relied on generalities whenever dealing with the
Soviets _ the primary foreign policy issue of our time _ came to
the fore.
   Reagan is leaving office on an entirely different note.
   He has held four summit meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and signed a treaty with Moscow to scrap
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Bush, his vice president, is trying to capitalize on the
improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, suggesting he is far more
capable than Dukakis to maintain the momentum.
   The fact that Reagan _ like Dukakis _ was inexperienced when he
ran for the presidency is not stopping Bush from questioning the
credentials of his opponent.

<HEAD>Afghan Terrorism in Pakistan Increases, US Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government was
responsible for repeated attacks on civilian targets in Pakistan in
1987 and carried out well over half of all incidents of
state-sponsored terrorism worldwide in that year, a State
Department report said today.
   The report, titled ``Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1987,'' was
completed before the incident last Wednesday in which a Pakistani
C-130 crashed, claiming the lives of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq,
U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel, Brig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom and
27 others.
   Pakistani officials believe terrorists were responsible and a
U.S. official said Afghan agents have to be ``among the suspects''
because of the stepped up campaign Afghan authorities are alleged
to be carrying out against Pakistan.
   The conflict between the two countries stems from Pakistani
support for Afghan rebels based in Pakistan who are fighting the
Kabul government and Pakistan's role as a haven for millions of
Afghan refugees.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Sunday that any
comments on the cause of the crash would be speculative because
investigators, including U.S. experts flown to Pakistan, are just
beginning their work.
   Redman spoke at Andrews Air Force, where the remains of Raphel
and Wassom were flown and a ceremony was held that included remarks
by Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci.
   Acting Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan said Saturday his
government suspects last Wednesday crash was the result of sabotage.
   ``Judging from the circumstances of the tragedy ... enemies of
Pakistan are actively posing a threat to the security of our
country,'' Ishaq Khan said.
   Paul Kriesburg, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said it would be a mistake to assume
automatically that Afghan agents were responsible for the crash
because Zia had many other enemies. They included some from within
the Pakistani military and others who were alienated by his
authoritarian rule.
   The State Department report said Afghan agents carried out 127
of the 189 incidents last year attributable to state-sponsored
terrorism.
   Iran was second with 44 and Libya followed with seven, the
report said.
   All told, there were 832 international terrorist incidents last
year. ``When the Pakistani numbers are subtracted, the number of
incidents in the rest of the world declined by almost 10 per cent
from 1986 statistics,'' it said.
   The report said the Afghan campaign had been largely limited to
the northwest part of Pakistan where rebel forces are based but
spread to major cities last year.
   It said the campaign is being waged by the Afghan Ministry of
State Security, known by the acronym WAD.
   Zia said last November that the assassinations and bombings
carried out against Pakistani civilians were ``at the behest of the
Soviet Union'' but Moscow has denied the allegation.
   U.S. and Pakistani officials estimate that bombs planted by
Afghan agents have killed more than 400 civilians in Pakistan. The
bloodiest incident occurred in July 1987 when three car bombs
exploded in the main bazaar of Karachi, killing 72 and injuring 260.
   The report said it is likely that the Soviets have been aware of
Afghan operations in Pakistan because of the close ties between WAD
and the Soviet intelligence agency, KGB.
   It said that while some of the material for the explosive
devices can be purchased on the black market, other items can be
obtained only through Soviet sources.
   Pakistan estimates that about 1,500 Soviet advisers work with
WAD.

<HEAD>Lobbyists Spent $63 Million Trying to Influence Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capitol Hill lobbyists paced by a
controversial Social Security advocacy group spent more than $63.62
million trying to influence Congress in 1987.
   The amount, compiled from required reports filed with the House
and Senate, represented a 4.5 percent increase from 1986, when a
massive overhaul of the nation's income tax laws spurred big
spending by registered lobbyists.
   The 1986 total of $60.87 million by some 8,500 individuals and
organizations was up from $49 million in 1985 and at the time was
the highest total since The Associated Press began compiling the
figures in 1983.
   The National Committee to Preserve Social Security led the pack
last year with a reported outlay of $2.93 million, much of it for
direct-mail campaigns designed to flood congressional offices with
letters from senior citizens.
   Headed by James Roosevelt, the son of President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, the organization has drawn fire from members of Congress
who say it uses scare tactics to obtain contributions from the
elderly.
   Roosevelt has defended the lobbying group, saying ``our cause is
a good one, our methods are honest, our concerns are sincere.''
   The $2.93 million was slightly below the $3 million in lobbying
expenses reported by the group for 1986, when it finished in second
place behind the $3.02 million spent by Citizens for Sensible
Control of Acid Rain.
   That group, bankrolled principally by electric utilities and
coal companies, decreased its 1987 lobbying expenses to $1.2
million, leaving it in eighth place among nine organizations
spending more than $1 million last year.
   Second spot in 1987 was occupied by perennial big-spender Common
Cause, the self-described citizens lobby that concentrates on
government ethics and election finance reform and attributes its
entire budget to lobbying.
   Common Cause spent $2.56 million last year, just ahead of the
$2.55 million reported by a tobacco company, Philip Morris USA,
which used direct-mail campaigns to oppose any increase in federal
excise taxes on tobacco products.
   Philip Morris spent about half its total in the final quarter of
1987. Its fourth-quarter outlay of $1.27 million was the highest by
any lobbying group for a three-month period last year.
   The Committee to Protect the Family ranked fourth in overall
spending last year with $1.95 million, followed by Sierra Club's
$1.5 million to support lobbying on environment and conservation
issues.
   The biggest spender among organized labor last year was the
National Association of Letter Carriers at $1.48 million. The other
million-plus spenders were the Fiber Fabric and Apparel Coalition
for Trade with $1.24 million and the Home Recording Rights
Coalition with nearly $1.18 million.
   The coalition, a consortium of audio component companies, has
been battling on Capitol Hill for several years against the
Recording Industry Association of America, composed of record and
tape manufacturers.
   The coalition's spending was far ahead of the $331,280 reported
by the recording association in the struggle over whether Congress
will restrict use of or impose royalty fees on digital audio tape,
the newest kid on the high-fidelity block.
   The continuing congressional debate over handgun control again
accounted for heavy lobbying expenses, with a group pushing for
firearms restrictions, Handgun Control Inc., leading spending in
this area with $900,343.
   The pro-control forces were outgunned, however, by collective
spending by their opponents: National Rifle Association of America,
$668,058; Gun Owners of America, $608,672; and Citizens Committee
for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, $271,435.
   Other large spenders last year included American Petroleum
Institute, $919,419; Project Cure, $909,018; Free the Eagle,
$896,555; Railway Labor Executives' Association, $800,293; Rainbow
Lobby, $765,329; and U.S. League of Savings Institutions, $728,803.
   Also, AFL-CIO, $576,504; American Israel Public Affairs
Committee, $543,273; United Auto Workers, $539,451; Man-Made Fiber
Producers Association Inc., $524,642; American Council of Life
Insurance Inc., $513,281; and American Farm Bureau Federation,
$512,671.
   Also, American Arts Alliance, $504,098; National Association of
Home Builders of the U.S., $490,062; American Bankers Association,
$476,707; National Association of Realtors, $440,141; Air Transport
Association of America, $412,175; and Disabled American Veterans,
$405,168.

<HEAD>Dukakis Emphasizes National Themes During Regional Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is emphasizing national campaign
themes as he visits northeastern Massachusetts, a region the
Democratic presidential nominee often cites when discussing his
record of economic development.
   As he did during a visit to central Massachusetts last week,
Dukakis is kicking off the visit with a meeting attended by area
elected officials, educators and business and labor leaders.
   The Massachusetts governor also planned today to distribute
grants for a new manufacturing research center and for improvements
at the Middlesex Community College campus in Lowell.
   From there, Dukakis was to attend an event to promote his
Homeownership Opportunity Program, which provides state assistance
to low- and moderate-income families looking to buy homes.
   Dukakis was to return to the northeastern corner of the state
Tuesday for several more events. He frequently mentions the
northeastern Massachusetts communities of Lawrence and Lowell, both
former mill cities, when discussing his efforts to spur economic
development in economically depressed areas.
   Dukakis spent Sunday at his Brookline home, where he returned
late Saturday night after a four-day campaign swing through parts
of Minnesota, Florida, Alabama, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas
and Tennessee.
   That trip started in the middle of the Republican National
Convention and was part of a campaign effort to keep Dukakis
visible during the GOP gathering.
   Aides billed the trip as highly successful. Dukakis revealed no
new positions on issues but was widely covered in the national news
media, particularly after Republican nominee George Bush's
selection of Sen. Dan Quayle as a running mate sparked controversy.
Questions have centered on Quayle's use of his wealthy family's
influence to help him join the National Guard and avoid the draft
at the height of the Vietnam War.
   Dukakis at virtually every stop indirectly criticized Quayle and
Bush's judgment for choosing him. Dukakis repeatedly discussed the
lenthy Senate record of his own running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, telling crowds the ``true test'' of presidential leadership
should be the quality of people selected to fill key positions.
   After spending today and Tuesday in Massachusetts, Dukakis plans
to campaign Wednesday and Thursday in Washington, D.C., Ohio and
Pennsylvania. He is scheduled to be back in Boston on Friday and
then back in the nation's capital Saturday to participate in a
march marking the 25th anniversary of the civil rights march on
Washington led by Martin Luther King Jr.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen has well-known differences with Michael Dukakis over Contra
aid, the MX Missile and school prayer. But reporters covering his
just-ended Texas swing found another one.
   Lloyd Bentsen is a pedal-to-the-metal guy.
   Dukakis fidgets at his driver when his car edges above
Massachusetts' 55 mph speed limit.
   But the Texas senator, told how long his entourage would take
for a drive from Brownsville to Mission, revealed his motoring
style. ``I'd make it a lot faster if the Secret Service weren't
around,'' he said.
   Lloyd Bentsen is a Texan who doesn't like to waste time. He's up
early, does his campaigning on schedule, and gets it finished on
time, though that's sometimes late in the evening.
   His walk and his gestures, which seem stiff on Capitol Hill,
make more sense in the Texas summer sun. ``There's not a lot of
wasted motion,'' observed one aide.
   And he's doing something on the road that reporters who cover
him in Washington almost never see.
   He's having fun.
   More often than not, Bentsen strolls back to the press section
of his plane and tell reporters of the last event: ``That was
great.''
   When the campaign jet goes nose-up on takeoff, the television
crews bowl an orange up from the back of the plane. After a week of
failed attempts, they scored by getting one into the cockpit.
   Bentsen, who had been casually monitoring the progress of these
efforts, grabbed the fruit and took out his pen. ``Aft-to-Cabin
Award,'' he wrote, and he signed it, dated it, and rolled it back.
The orange was mounted to the ceiling, where it hung as a trophy
until the end of the trip Sunday night.
   Rarely quotable and known for his attention to detail in the
Senate, Bentsen now seems to relish making those quick quips that
ignite campaign rhetoric, and he's even cracking a few jokes.
   When reporters groaned about the length of the nine-day trip,
Bentsen smiled. ``I get time-and-a-half after five days,'' he said.
   Hearing that George Bush said the Republicans would fight like
pit bulls, Bentsen replied: ``There'll probably be enough bull to
go around.''
   At midweek, after Republican George Bush picked 41-year-old
Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, the 67-year Bentsen wasn't going to let
himself be seen as the old man of the campaign. He increased the
dumbbell weights for his morning treadmill exercise from four
pounds to five pounds.
   ``It's not the miles on you, it's the depth of the tread,'' he
said of the ``age gap.''
   After a tedious session of satellite feeds in a Dallas
television station, Bentsen cleaned up and, emerging from his
makeup, shouted, ``Hey, remember me. I'm the 41-year-old guy.''
   Bentsen and his wife of 45 years, Beryl Ann, were together
almost constantly, he always introducing her as ``B.A. _ that
stands for Bentsen's best asset.'' The former model would sometimes
fuss over his hair if it was out of place.
   One morning in East Texas, the two campaigned separately until
she rejoined him while he was doing some interviews. It took a
moment for him to spot her. ``What a good lookin' woman you are _
are you spoken for?'' he exclaimed.
   Mrs. Bentsen chats with reporters less frequently than the
senator, but on one plane ride she was asked if she would mind a
personal question. She seemed a little reluctant, but went along.
   Is it true, she was asked half-jokingly, that the senator has a
body of a 41-year-old? She replied without hesitation.
   ``You bet. No question about it,'' she said.
   Always looking for a gaffe, reporters have found slim pickings
in the veteran Bentsen. One of his infrequent mistakes came when
one attempt at humor seemed inappropriate.
   Asked about President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative,
which promises to shoot down enemy nuclear warheads, Bentsen
expressed his doubts. If even one got through, he said, ``it will
ruin your whole day.''
   Bentsen clearly was comfortable campaigning Texas, his native
state where he was first elected to the Senate in 1970. His gave
his stump speech in some of the hottest places on the planet, and
usually he emerged looking fresh and crisp.
   It was so hot in a wool warehouse in San Angelo that Bentsen's
shirt was sticking to his body as he discussed the cattle business
with local citizens.
   But in a few minutes he was cleaned up and strolling to his next
speech at a nearby park.
   The Bentsen entourage includes experts from Dukakis' campaign to
help advise him and coordinate the Democratic ticket. But when a
herd of cattle charged and cut off the press bus at the LBJ Ranch,
the Dukakis people were stumped and guessed wildly when reporters
wanted to know what they were.
   ``Oh, nonsense, they were just whiteface,'' declared Bentsen,
who grew up on his father's ranch.

   A Soviet rocket that plummeted to Earth in
northeastern Canada put on a spectacular light show for residents
of the western and northern United States, but it was not all that
unusual in other respects, Pentagon officials say.
   The craft that crashed Sunday, causing no reported injuries or
damage, was also not Cosmos 1900, the Soviet spy satellite that has
been drifting out of orbit for several months and arousing concern
because it is nuclear-powered.
   The rocket had been launched last Thursday to boost a Gorizont
communications satellite into orbit, said Maj. Alex Mondragon,
spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the
U.S. Space Command, speaking from Peterson Air Force Base near
Colorado Springs.
   The vehicle, which came down at about 1 a.m. EDT, was most
likely an SL12, one of the most frequently used Soviet launchers,
he said.
   The craft was tracked by officials at the U.S. Space
Surveillance Center at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, where about
7,200 space vehicles are constantly being observed. An average of
one space vehicle reenters the Earth's atmosphere each day,
Mondragon said.
   ``It's not unusual for a rocket body not to stay in orbit,'' he
said. ``There's nothing to keep it there.''
   Cosmos 1900, launched last Dec. 12, is now expected to reenter
the Earth's atmosphere in late September or early October,
Mondragon said.
   Mondragon and Pentagon spokesman Maj. Mike Stepp provided no
further details about the craft's condition when it reached the
Earth or the precise location where it came down.
   Mondragon said it usually takes about 24 hours to pinpoint where
downed satellites plummet to Earth.
   The spokesmen said the descending rocket was visible to
residents of New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska and Michigan.
   ``I do understand it was pretty spectacular,'' Stepp said.
   He said the downing of the craft, which he referred to as a
``non-nuclear Soviet rocket body,'' was expected by U.S. officials.
   ``It was predicted it would come down, it came down as predicted
and it came down where it was predicted,'' he said.
   Mondragon said officials do not try to recover parts of such
rocket bodies because 95 percent of them usually burn up upon
reentry.
   ``That spectacular light show that they provide folks with is
the rocket body burning up,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A group of Soviet bloc opposition
activists urged their governments to denounce the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years ago and rehabilitate those who
were later purged.
   They also called on the Soviet Union to reveal ``missing facts''
about its role in the suppression of reform movements throughout
Eastern Europe.
   The dissidents issued a statement Sunday signed by 115 people
from 25 different organizations in the Soviet Union, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany.
   Czechoslovakia was invaded Aug. 20-21, 1968, by troops from the
Soviet Union and other forces of the Warsaw Pact alliance. They
crushed reforms by Czechoslovakia's liberal Communist government,
ending what is known as the ``Prague Spring.''
   The dissidents' statement was released by Palach Press, a
London-based publication that monitors the Czechoslovak political
scene.
   ``The leaders of the invading countries should publicly denounce
the invasion 20 years ago,'' said the statement.
   It also said, ``Slandering of the `Prague Spring' should cease
and the thousands who were expelled from political, cultural and
scientific life should be rehabilitated.
   ``The Soviet Union should clarify not only missing facts about
Soviet-Polish relations, but also its role in the suppression of
(East) Berlin workers in 1953, in the Hungarian uprising in 1956,
in the suppression of the Czechoslovak democratization in 1968 and
in the Polish coup d'etat in 1981,'' the statement said.
   The mention of a ``Polish coup'' referrred to the imposition of
martial law in Poland in December 1981 and banning the next fall of
the Solidarity free trade union movement.
   The invasion of Czechoslovakia ``marked the victory of
reactionary forces throughout the whole region, thus causing the
present-day crisis of East-Central Europe,'' the statement said.
   ``It is the earnest wish of all our nations that the Soviet
state keeps its promise and withdraws its troops from the occupied
countries,'' it said.
   According to Palach Press, Soviets who signed the statement
included Lev Timofeyev of the Press Club Glasnost and
representatives of the International Federation for Human Rights.
   It said 13 Hungarian organizations, each represented by two
people, signed the statement including writers Sandor Csoori,
Istvan Csurka and Miklos Haraszti and philosopher Janos Kis.
   Among the 31 Polish signers were Solidarity leaders Zbigniew
Bujak, Jacek Kuron, Adam Michnik and Bronislaw Geremek.
   There were 11 former or current Charter 77 members among the 23
Czechoslovak signers, including playwright Vaclav Havel.
   Among the 13 East German signatories were Protestant clergyman
Rainer Eppelmann and Werner Fischer, Wolfgang Templin and Peter
Grimm of the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights.

<HEAD>Administration Changes Tune on Farm Loan Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's
business-and-industrial loan program has become a kingpin of the
administration's rural development effort, helping finance projects
from catfish plants to macadamia nuts.
   Once despised by White House budget trimmers as something local
communities and private citizens ought to do for themselves, the
``B&I'' loans handled by the department's Farmers Home
Administration have enjoyed new status in recent years.
   The financial battering of farmers in the early 1980s, the
hardships that hit the economy of small-town America, and the
insistent demands of Congress have helped jog the administration
into a new look at rural development.
   For the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, according to FmHA
spokesman Marlyn Aycock, B&I loan guarantees are expected to use
the full $95.7 million authorized by Congress, the second year in a
row that has happened.
   According to FmHA records, the B&I volume soared to more than $1
billion in 1979-80 before winding down under the Reagan
administration, which unsuccessfully for several years advocated
elimination of the program.
   The USDA's budget office in presenting proposals for fiscal
1984, for example, explained the reasons for seeking reduction or
elimination of many of the FmHA community programs, including sewer
and water assistance, and B&I.
   ``Reductions in rural development program loans and grants
reflect the administration's philosophy that private sector
investment, not public sector pump priming, should drive
development,'' the USDA said. ``The federal role in the rural
sector will be limited to that of lender of last resort in
providing water, sewer and community facilities essential to the
health and safety of households where most needed in rural areas.''
   Congress reduced annual authorizations for B&I in the early
1980s, and the administration kept the actual loan level far below
that. In 1984, for example, when B&I was authorized at $200
million, the actual lending level was held to $124 million.
   Lending dropped to $61 million in 1985 and to $55 million in
1986. Then in 1987, when Congress set the authority for B&I at
$95.7 million, the full amount was used for the first time during
the Reagan administration.
   Aycock said that as of this April the B&I program had 2,238
loans outstanding for a total of $1.82 billion. Of those, 475
loans, or 21 percent, were delinquent, a total of $230 million.
   In its 16 years, the B&I program has provided more than 7,000
guaranteed loans totaling nearly $6 billion, according to the
background information provided by FmHA at the request of The
Associated Press.
   B&I was authorized by Congress in 1972 to provide loans ``for
the purpose of improving, developing or financing business,
industry and employment and improving the economic and
environmental climate in rural communities, including pollution
abatement and control.''
   An example of the program's intent was a 1974 loan to American
Cotton Growers, Lubbock, Texas, for $28.2 million to finance a new
denim manufacturing plant in Littlefield, near the fields where
cotton grew. Two more loans brought the total to $33.5 million.
   ``Jobs were created for more than 600 people, and a ready market
was provided for Plains cotton,'' the agency said. ``It was made
into high-quality denim, much of which was bought by Levi Strauss
over the years. The loan was paid in full on Aug. 4, 1987.''
   Some more recent examples include:
   _$2 million for Fishco Inc., Belzoni, Miss., to help build a
catfish processing plant with a capacity of 40 million pound per
year. The plant is expected to employ 432 people when running at
full capacity.
   _$2 million for Stoneville Furniture Company Inc., Stoneville,
N.C., to buy equipment and machinery. Funds also will be used for
working capital. The plant employs approximately 700.
   _$4.5 million for Fairmont Foods of Minnesota Inc., Fairmont,
Minn., to buy and reopen a food processing plant, and to purchase
new machinery and equipment to produce frozen processed foods. The
project will create 234 jobs.
   The B&I loan program over the years also has been used for
cotton gins, the manufacture of radar ``guns'' used by police, a
shrimp farm in Hawaii, a chicken processing, a radio station,
automobile dealerships, and plants to make fuel-grade ethanol.
   As another recent USDA report described program operations,
ventures ``range from the processing and marketing of coffee beans
and macadamia nuts in Hawaii to the manufacturing of equipment to
convert solid waste to boiler fuel in Alaska.''
   Under the recently enacted $3.9 billion drought-aid package, the
FmHA was ordered to use B&I ``to the maximum extent possible'' to
help businesses adversely affected by drought.
   Congress included $200 million for guaranteed loans to rural
businesses and organizations to recover from drought losses. Those
loans will have a lid of $500,000 per individual.

<HEAD>Panama Says U.S. Harassment Charges Are Psychological Warfare</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Panama's Defense Forces say charges
that its troops are harassing U.S. troops are part of a
psychological war designed to destabilize the government of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The statement released late Sunday said U.S. officials who
reportedly accused the Panamanian government of deliberately
sanctioning attacks on Americans ``must have the IQ of a 3-year-old
Cro-Magnon.''
   U.S. officials in the Panamanian capital said Sunday that U.S.
personnel have reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by
Panamanian authorities this year, including attempts to extort
bribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail.
   ``PDF (Panama Defense Forces) members have been notably less
courteous in dealing with our people,'' said an official at the
U.S. Southern Command who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. sanctions aimed at ousting Noriega, who has been indicted
by two federal grand juries in Florida on drug trafficking charges,
were applied in March and have damaged Panama's economy.
   Panama's Defense Forces said the harassment reports sought ``to
destabilize Panama and immerse it in chaos, an indispensible step
for not fulfilling and to annul the Panama Canal Treaties, and
particularly to prolong the U.S. military presence beyond the year
2000,'' when the United States has agreed to turn the canal over to
Panama.
   Cynthia Farrell, a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Panama
City, said Sunday that the reports of harassment are coming from
U.S. military personnel.
   ``Civilians, business people and embassy personnel have reported
no increase in harassment,'' she said.
   She said she was not sure whether U.S. military personnel are
being bothered more or are ``simply reporting more cases.''
   The latest incident occurred when Panamanian officials blocked
U.S. trucks from picking up mail at Torrijos International Airport
for three days last week, a second Southern Command official said.
   The official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
dispute was satisfactorily settled. A Panamanian official called
the dispute a ``bureaucratic misunderstanding.''
   The U.S. official said 240 cases of harassment were reported
from February to August: ``What's going on these days has been
going on for months _ going way back to last year.
   ``One of the things that's happening is that a lot of people are
being asked for bribes when they're stopped for traffic violations,
and that's probably because the police aren't getting paid
regularly,'' the official said. ``But if a case like that is
reported, it goes down as harassment.''
   The New York Times on Sunday quoted Southern Command, State and
Defense Department officials as saying there have recently been an
increasing number of beatings, abductions, rape and extortion of
U.S. military personnel and their dependents.
   The story, under a Washington dateline, said the U.S. officials
view the incidents as a campaign by the Noriega regime to pressure
the United States to lift economic sanctions against Panama.
   However, Southern Command officials disagreed with the reported
motive and one official said the increased harassment ``could be
just an indication of individual frustration and anger.''
   The Panama Defense Forces statement said, ``The supposed U.S.
government officials (cited by the Times) must have the IQ of a
three-year-old Cro-Magnon when they assert that actions taken by
the Panama Defense Forces against U.S. military personnel are
attempts to force the Reagan administration to lift or soften
economic sanctions imposed on Panama.''
   The statement said U.S. troops cause daily problems for
Panamanian authorities, including fights, mistreatment of women,
venereal disease, shooting in public places and refusing to pay bar
and restaurant tabs.
   U.S. sanctions were applied after Noriega ousted President Eric
Arturo Delvalle. Delvalle has since been in hiding, but the United
States continues to recognize him as Panama's legitimate president.
   About 12,000 U.S. servicemen are stationed in Panama by treaty
to protect the Panama Canal, a vital waterway linking the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans. They are attached to the Southern Command,
which is in charge of all U.S. military operations south of the
U.S.-Mexico border.

   The Soviet Union, in an unusual display of
openness, has agreed to allow U.S. researchers to see ``oceans'' of
archives that one historian says show incidences of collaboration
with Nazi occupation forces in World War II.
   After a preliminary survey of the material this month, ``our
historians tell us they have seen documents that have not been seen
by Western eyes for the past 40 years,'' said Miles Lerman,
chairman of the Committee of International Relations for the United
States Holocaust Memorial Council.
   Lerman signed an agreement July 29 in Moscow which will allow
U.S. historians to photograph the documents for storage in the
holocaust museum Congress has authorized the council to build on
the Washington Mall by 1991.
   The Soviets also will receive microfilm and microfiche copies of
the documents, made at the expense of the U.S. council.
   ``By microfilming and microfiching the documents we extend their
shelf life for by at least 300 years,'' said Lerman. ``That's one
of the things that turned them around.''
   The Kremlin has long blocked Western and Soviet historians from
viewing archives, including those from the period of Nazi
occupation, and U.S. historians attribute the shift to the reform
policies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``This is a 180-degree turn around in the attitude of the Soviet
authorities,'' said Raul Hilberg, a University of Vermont historian
who accompanied Lerman on his trip to Moscow and reviewed documents
in the Soviet capital and other cities.
   ``It's a humongous amount, oceans and oceans of material'' in
three dozen archives administered by Glav Archiv for the Soviet
Council of Ministers, said Lerman.
   The archives will not be opened to Soviets, said Lerman and
Hilberg.
   In the past, the Soviets have given the West piecemeal archival
materials, such as the identification card that was crucial in the
conviction last April of John Demjanjuk. He was sentenced to death
in Israel for operating gas chambers at Treblinka, the Nazi camp in
Poland where hundreds of thousands died.
   Hilberg, who has been studying holocaust documents for 40 years,
said the Soviet archives provide extraordinary detail of the
day-to-day operation of Nazi death camps and the security forces
under German occupation.
   ``The collaboration was much greater in areas held by the Soviet
Union for brief periods of time'' before the war, ``higher in the
west Ukraine than in the east, higher in the Baltic buffer states
and eastern Poland,'' said Hilberg.
   Those areas were annexed by the Soviet Union under the secret
provisions of a Nazi-Soviet treaty signed the month before Germany
invaded Poland in 1939, starting World War II.
   Material in the archives ``shows the transformation of the human
psyche during the Nazi occupation,'' said Hilberg. ``The drastic
nature of the German occupation was such that the effect on the
population was dramatic. This was true not only of Jews who were
killed, but those who watched it.''
   In one document Hilberg reviewed in the Soviet archives, ``a
German officer wrote that anti-Semitism was decreasing among
Latvians in 1943'' after nearly all the Jews in that Baltic
republic had been killed and the Soviets started to drive the Nazis
out, said Hilberg.
   The Latvians, said Hilberg, ``saw they had thrown in their lot
with the Germans, they virtually exterminated the Jewish population
there, and then they had second thoughts'' as the Soviets turned
the tide of battle.
   ``Altogether in this country we may have underestimated the
extent to which people in the Soviet Union were subjected to the
occupation. We might have had a different relationship with the
Soviet Union if we had known this.
   ``But the Soviets were secretive, apparently trying to hide the
weaknesses of communism, and in some cases the degree to which
people collaborated,'' he said.
   Photographing the documents might take about a year, and cost $1
million to $1.5 million, Hilberg said.
   The microfilm will be housed in the holocaust museum, a 200,000
square foot structure to be built adjacent to the Bureau of
Printing and Engraving near the Washington Monument, for an
estimated cost of $90 million raised from private donations.
   The holocaust council, consisting of 55 members appointed by the
president and five each from the House and Senate, plans to raise
an additional $53 million as a permanent endowment for the museum,
said spokesman Samuel Eshkenazi.

   A drunken driver was beaten and seriously
injured by a mob after his van struck a mother pushing a baby
carriage in a park, killing her 4-month-old son, police said.
   The driver, Lorgio Cano, was in critical but stable condition
this morning at Jacobi Hospital, said Cynthia Balot, a nursing
supervisor. He suffered severe head trauma, said police Lt. Edward
Shalvey.
   Cano, 59, was charged with manslaughter, driving while
intoxicated and other violations of traffic and park regulations,
Shalvey said.
   The crash occurred Sunday evening at a soccer field in Van
Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, said Sgt. John Venetucci, a police
spokesman.
   Cano was leaving the area with his family after watching a
soccer game when his van struck the carriage pushed by Luisa
Martinez, 21.
   She was treated at a hospital for minor injuries; her son,
Justo, was pronounced dead at North Central Bronx Hospital, police
said.
   After the crash, a large crowd set upon the van, beating Cano,
his wife and children, Shalvey said. Cano's relatives received
minor injuries, Shalvey said.
   Eight people were treated for minor injuries, said Capt. Donald
Rothschild of Emergency Medical Services.

   A suspicious fire at a crowded social club
killed seven and injured more than 30 as panicked patrons clawed
against the walls and doors trying to flee, leaving those who
escaped ``one step from death.''
   Between 60 and 100 people were in the Bronx club known as El
Hoyo (The Hole) when the blaze ignited shortly after noon Sunday,
said John Mulligan, a fire department spokesman.
   Five bodies were found inside the gutted club and two people
died later, authorities said.
   Screaming patrons in the basement club fought for the lone exit,
up a stairway where the fire apparently started, authorities said.
Some broke through a rear wall and were pulled to safety by
firefighters.
   Some who escaped joined bystanders in rushing back in to try to
save others, getting in the way of firefighters and even grabbing
their tools, firefighters said.
   ``It was sheer panic,'' said firefighter Dennis Fennell. ``It
looked like people tried to claw out all of the walls.''
   ``We had to break a door to get to the first floor. ... Then we
had to break in the gate and some people helped from outside to
open the gate,'' said Luis Done, one of those who escaped.
   ``I was one step from death. I feel very lucky.''
   ``All of a sudden I saw the flames come from the bar area. There
was a lot of flames. It was very fast. All of a sudden, whoosh,''
said another patron, Francisco Delarosa, 32.
   Investigators were testing material from the basement for the
presence of flammable liquid, according to Mulligan, who said the
fire was suspicious because it spread rapidly.
   Up to 150 firefighters battled nearly three hours to bring the
fire under control.
   ``There was so much fire blowing out into the street that water
didn't have any effect on it in the initial stages,'' said fire
Capt. James Gallagher.
   The club was in a low-ceiling, 50-by-75-foot basement of a row
of stores and divided into smaller rooms.
   The bodies of four men and one woman were found toward the front
of the club, Gallagher said.
   He said one ``poor guy was found with his face in the wall like
he was trying to crawl into a corner.''
   There was no evidence of a posted license at the club, Mulligan
said. Taverns are prohibited in basements and there weren't enough
exits to satisfy building codes, said Deputy Fire Chief Philip J.
Burns.
   Firefighters were ``met by hysterical civilians streaming up the
staircase,'' Mulligan said. ``One firefighter told me he literally
had to fight his way down the stairs.''
   Most escaped through the club's small front door and narrow
staircase, but others were able to break through a wall near the
back, he said. A second door on the side of the club was locked
shut, he said.
   Firefighter Joseph Kisonas said hysterical people outside the
club ``were trying to fight the tools away from us'' so they could
re-enter and help others.
   Three patrons broke through a rear wall ``and our guys pulled
them out of the rubble and gypsum board,'' Mulligan said.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who toured the scene, described the club
as a ``rabbit warren.''
   ``It's clear that it should have never been opened in the first
place,'' he said of the club.
   Most of the injured, including six firefighters and two
Emergency Medical Service technicians, suffered smoke inhalation
and were taken to hospitals, Mulligan said.
   Sunday's fire was reminiscent of an Oct. 24, 1976, arson fire at
a Bronx social club that killed 25 and injured more than 30. Three
men, including one who quarreled with a woman at the club, were
convicted of setting the fire on the club's only staircase.

   A fire in the locomotive of an Amtrak
passenger train Sunday forced the evacuation of its passengers and
blocked the New York-Washington rail corridor for four hours, an
Amtrak official said.
   The 172 passengers aboard an Amtrak Metroliner, Train 123, were
evacuated to a rear car about 8:10 p.m. with no injuries, said
Amtrak spokeswoman Marci Larson.
   Trains in both directions were backed up because power to the
overhead electrical line that powers many trains on the heavily
traveled corridor was cut to enable firefighters to battle the
blaze, Ms. Larson said.
   With the fire still burning shortly after 11 p.m., power was
restored briefly and about 10 trains that were backed up were
allowed to move through, said Capt. Frank Stokes.
   The tracks were closed again after midnight Sunday and were
reopened more than an hour later, officials said. Firefighters
remained at the scene at 2 a.m. Monday to clean up and to
investigate the cause of the blaze, the Anne Arundel Fire
Department said.
   Morning traffic was expected to run normally today, Amtrak
spokeswoman Debbie Marciniak said.
   Ms. Larson said she did not know how many passengers were
affected by the backup. The evacuated passengers were taken by bus
to Washington.
   Smoke was spotted coming from the engine of the Metroliner about
7:40 p.m., 17 miles south of Baltimore, and the train was stopped
near Grove, the Amtrak spokeswoman said. The train left New York at
5 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive in Washington at 7:55 p.m.

<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning actress Helen Hayes
was in good condition after being hospitalized for irregular heart
beat, and doctors were trying to determine if she suffered a heart
attack or only altitude sickness.
   Miss Hayes, 87, had been visiting her son, actor James
MacArthur, in Crested Butte when she became ill.
   She was flown the 100 miles from the Rocky Mountain town whose
elevation is nearly 10,000 feet to St. Mary's Hospital here.
   ``She is very tired and really apprehensive about the media
learning about her being here,'' Karen Bennett, a nursing
supervisor, said Sunday night.
   ``I really feel it was just the altitude that was bothering
her,'' said Dr. Dan Tullius of Crested Butte. ``But she was sent to
Grand Junction to confirm whether or not she had a heart attack.
... She had an irregular heart beat and it could be secondary to
altitude.''
   Grand Junction's elevation is about 6,000 feet.
   Miss Hayes had attended the Republican National Convention in
New Orleans last week and ``had gone from a lower elevation to a
higher elevation and her body wouldn't tolerate it,'' said Bennett.
   The silver-haired actress ended her theater career in 1971,
after 66 years, because of allergies to dust that aggravated her
chronic asthmatic bronchitis. She has continued to work before the
camera and is active in causes such as the rights of the elderly.
   She has won a Tony, two Oscars and an Emmy, and in 1981 received
the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievement. In 1980, she
was selected as one of 10 American artists to be commemorated on a
gold medallion issued by the Treasury Department.

   Bank presidents, schoolchildren,
housewives and the unemployed worked side-by-side to prepare a
city-owned plant that will house a chemical factory and employ 25
workers.
   Chicago-based Omnitech is the first company to locate in the
area since the city made industrial recruitment its top priority in
late 1986.
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' car dealer Gregg Cocker, 33, said
as he scrubbed walls. ``This will help out the town and I want to
do my part. It will come back and help me in the future.''
   About 130 residents volunteered Saturday to clean the plant in
the work-hungry community of 21,000 people about 75 miles south of
Memphis.
   ``I think it's incredible,'' Omnitech president Jack Cook said.
``I've never seen anything like it.''
   The company expects to begin production in October with 25
workers, and hopes to employ 50 people within two years.
   Economic problems in the city are similar to those throughout
the Mississippi Delta. Unemployment ran as high as 21 percent in
1987, dropping to 10.6 percent in June.
   Omnitech will use the 86,000-square-foot building formerly
occupied by a motor-home manufacturer. The plant has been vacant
since March 1986.
   ``We got our big frog,'' George F. Walker, president of the
Coahoma County Industrial Foundation, said referring to a campaign
inviting industries to be a big frog in the Clarksdale's ``little
pond.''

<TEXT>
   About 400 workers carrying the Polish flag
and chanting ``Solidarity'' marched through the Lenin shipyard to
its main gate on Monday and proclaimed a strike, the yard's second
this year.
   The outlawed free trade federation Solidarity had urged the
shipyard's 10,000 workers to join a string of occupation strikes
demanding union recognition and wage increases.
   At least 10 coal mines in southern Poland and transit and
dockworkers in the Baltic port of Szczecin remained on strike on
the seventh day of Poland's worst wave of labor unrest since 1981.
At least 76,000 workers were idled.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa offered Sunday to suspend his call
for a Gdansk shipyard strike if the government agreed to talks on
the labor strife.
   But the offer went unheeded.
   There was no sign of police interference as, 2{ hours after the
day shift began, workers took over the main gate of the shipyard
where Solidarity was born. In May, the yard was the scene of an
8-day strike that ended inconclusively.
   ``We warn the authorities that in case force is used against the
striking workforce, the full responsibility for the consequences
will lie with Polish authorities,'' strike leaders in Szczecin said
in a statement late Sunday.
   Police and riot troops were seen gathering around two Szczecin
shipyards which have not gone on strike, strike leaders said. They
also patrolled the streets of Gdansk.
   Striking dockworkers in Szczecin, fearing a police raid, said
they had rolled cranes and other equipment to block the entrances
to the port, which they have been occupying since Wednesday.
   Interfactory strike committee member Jozef Kowalczyk said at 6
a.m. that the night had passed without incident.
   In Jastrzebie, the center of the coal-mine strikes in the
southwestern Silesia region, miners on Monday published the first
edition of a strike newspaper and management and workers exchanged
letters setting forth their positions on undertaking talks.
   Walesa, speaking at St. Brygida's church Sunday to about 3,000
union supporters, said authorities had approached him through
unofficial channels about holding talks, but gave few details.
   He said he expected the government's reply to be delivered on
the national television news Sunday evening. But the news, devoted
mainly to the existing strikes across Poland, carried no mention of
Walesa and no hint about talks.
   Instead, the commentator suggested the strikes would continue.
   ``Tomorrow Poland will enter the second week of strikes, and we
will continue estimating the losses for our economy,'' said TV news
announcer Waldemar Milewicz.
   A spokesman in the government press office in Warsaw also had no
comment on Walesa's remarks.
   After watching the newscast at St. Brygida's, Walesa brushed
past reporters and went home, saying only that his earlier
statements stood.
   Meanwhile, the Solidarity committee of the Nowa Huta steel mill
outside Krakow issued a statement Sunday calling on steelworkers to
``support strikers' demands at the proper moment.''
   Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was
founded in the Gdansk shipyard in 1980. It was suppressed in a
December 1981 military crackdown after massive strikes and outlawed
the next fall.
   The government-controlled media has called the current strikes
illegal and and stressed their rising cost to the economy. But it
has made no clear statement on the government's plans.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski met Saturday with top
military leaders. The state-run PAP news agency said they made
``appropriate decisions ... in connection with the present
threats,'' but it was not known what they decided.
   Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told the crowd at
St. Brygida's that he wanted to avoid a strike.
   ``We cannot pull Poland out of her troubles by means of
strikes,'' he said. ``We are ready for dialogue and talks.''
   Police barred priests from entering the July Manifesto mine in
Silesia Sunday morning to say Mass, angering striking miners who
had to listen over loudspeakers, but dockworkers were permitted
religious services at the idled port in Szczecin.
   At Szczecin, the country's second-busiest port after Gdansk,
about 500 dockworkers attended a Mass, according to a strike
committee spokesman reached by telephone. About 200 sympathizers
and family members listened to the Mass from beyond the port gates.
   But at the coal mine in Jastrzebie, where the labor unrest began
Tuesday, angry erupted when authorities barred two priests from
entering.
   Strike leaders pleaded for 90 minutes for the clergymen to be
let in as hundreds of strikers chanted, ``We want the priests. We
want the priests.''
   But when authorities would not relent, a makeshift altar made
and the Mass was broadcast over loudspeakers to those inside.
   PAP claimed Sunday that ``the wildcat strikes are controlled by
a narrow group of people who do not hide their political aims.
   It said several thousand miners had signed declarations that
they want to return to work.

   An emaciated Cesar Chavez broke bread to

men and women throughout North America and the world who have
offered to share the suffering,'' said Chavez in a statement read
by his eldest son, Fernando.
   ``The fast will go on in hundreds of distant places and it will
multiply among thousands and then millions of caring people until
every poisoned grape is off the supermarket shelves.''
   After the Mass, Chavez, who lost 33{ pounds or 19 percent of his
174 pounds during the water-only fast, was taken from the union
compound in this community 150 miles north of Los Angeles to an
undisclosed location.
   He was to be put on a liquid diet, including light broth and
non-citrus juices, that will last up to 10 days, said one of his
physicians, Dr. Marion Moses.
   It was not known if he would suffer long-term complications from
the fast, which began July 17 and was his longest, but there were
no plans to place him in a hospital, said Moses.
   Chavez, a vegetarian, began the fast in good health and remained
mentally sharp throughout, she said.
   He endured stomach cramps, dehydration, vomiting, dizziness and
other ailments in his effort to bring attention to the United Farm
Workers' 4-year-old boycott of California table grapes. The union
said workers and consumers face a greater risk of cancer from the
five pesticides used on California table grapes.
   But grape growers and grocers have said Chavez and the union
have unduly frightened consumers about the safety of table grapes
in an effort to fight a political battle.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who sought this year's Democratic
presidential nomination, began a three-day fast as Chavez ended
his. Other politicians and celebrities, including actors Martin
Sheen and Robert Blake, have promised to fast for two or three days
as well.
   ``I'm here in a great tradition because Bobby Kennedy would have
been here, Martin Luther King would have been here. They can kill
the dreamers but they can't kill the dream,'' Jackson said.
   When the grape boycott began in 1984, Chavez accused the state
Agricultural Labor Relations Board, which governs farm labor
elections, of becoming a tool of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian.
   Chavez raised the pesticide issue in 1986, and called for
Captan, Dinoseb, Phosdrin, methyl bromide and Parathion to be taken
off the market.
   About 6,000 supporters attended the Roman Catholic Communion
service under a giant white tent, an event reminiscent of the end
of Chavez's 25-day fast in 1968 to protest escalating violence in
the fields and gain recognition of the fledgling union.
   Sen. Robert F. Kennedy broke bread with Chavez that day, as his
widow, Ethel, did Sunday. Besides the consecrated wafer, Chavez ate
only a few crumbs of bread fed to him by Mrs. Kennedy.
   Jackson and Mrs. Kennedy appeared shocked at Chavez's condition.
He shook and trembled throughout the service and rarely looked up.
His doctor, who sat directly behind him, kept a watchful eye on him.
   After he sat in a wooden rocker, Chavez leaned over to his
96-year-old mother, who was crying, and dabbed her eyes with a
handkerchief.

   A 22-year-old aerospace engineering
student from France sat hunched over architectural drawings of a
lunar base module, sketching the future of the final frontier.
   Richard Fourier's drawings won't stand as monuments to progress
in space development. But where they were done just might.
   Fournier of Toulouse was one of 104 students from 21 countries
including the Soviet Union who assembled on the campus of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology this summer in the first
session of the International Space University.
   They are scientists, engineers, policymakers and future
astronauts with one thing in common: They dream of a global effort
to explore and colonize space.
   Students attended 240 hours of lectures on subjects such as
orbital space debris, international space law and problems of bone
decalcification in space.
   The university, the first of its kind, wants to ``set forth an
agenda for space exploration'' and create a ``coherent space
culture,'' said Todd B. Hawley, its 27-year-old co-founder.
   ``Over time there will be a global space culture and there has
to be an understanding of what is possible on an international
basis,'' Hawley said.
   In 1985, Hawley and co-founder Peter H. Diamandis, also 27,
formed the Space Generation Foundation to develop ideas for
international space exploration. They raised $100,000 and came up
with ideas including a university where people from around the
world could learn from space experts.
   Since a founding conference at MIT in April 1987, Hawley and
Diamandis have raised more than $1 million from government, private
and corporate sources, including $100,000 from the Soviet Union to
enroll a 12-student delegation. About a third of the 350 students
and professionals from around the world who applied for this year's
course were accepted and their home countries paid the $10,000 fee.
   ``We are the countries with the highest technology and we must
cooperate,'' said Alexander Prokhorov, 24, a graduate student at
the Institute of Aircraft Technologies in Moscow. ``All peaceful
co-existence in space is a better alternative than (the Strategic
Defense Initiative). It's better to go to Mars or Venus together.''
   During the nine-week session that ended Saturday, students
tested space shuttle suits, operated a robot that performed a
simulated scavenging of the lunar surface, and built small lunar
mining vehicles and tested them in sandboxes.
   The 84 lecturers from 14 countries were drawn from the world's
top space organizations, including that National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the European
Space Agency, the Soviet Cardiology Research Center and the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization.
   The point the university makes is that, with the decline of the
American space program following the 1986 explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger, the future development of space necessarily
must be an international venture.
   ``There's no point in America going to Mars and the Soviet Union
going to Mars,'' said Russell Hannigan, 24, a spacecraft systems
engineer with British Aerospace in London. ``It's a waste of
national resources just to do national programs.''
   ``Space programs are very expensive,'' added Fabola de Oliveira,
34, of Brazil's Institute of Space Research, which is launching its
first data collection satellite next year. ``As a developing
country, we have no way of really going for space programs without
international cooperation.''
   The university will remain a summer school until 1992, when the
founders hope to begin a five-year degree program with a permanent
faculty, a main campus and satellite campuses at the world's top
space centers. Next year's program will be in either France or West
Germany.
   Hawley's dream of space involves everything from ``lunar and
Mars development to solar-powered satellites to asteroid rendezvous
and mining to building actual colonies in space.''
   ``This is a 100-year vision,'' he said. ``We feel very strongly
that that can happen.''

<HEAD>Homeless Advocates: Federal Government Should Fund Permanent
Housing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government should help fund
permanent, affordable housing programs to accommodate street people
because emergency shelters have failed to curb the number of
homeless, researchers said.
   The homeless should have access to the more affordable housing
to ease dependency on crowded, understaffed shelters, according
participants at a seminar Sunday at the annual meeting of the
Society for the Study of Social Problems.
   The plan originally adopted by advocacy groups called for crisis
services in emergency shelters, helping homeless people
re-establish their lives, and supplying low-income housing for
those who could live independently, said Madeline Stoner of the
University of Southern California's School of Social Work.
   But that plan didn't work because many homeless people have
turned the temporary shelters into ``a permanent living
situation,'' Ms. Stoner said.
   ``Shelters have not only failed to stem the growth of
homelessness, their existence has served to perpetuate the homeless
condition by keeping many in a transient state,'' she said.
   ``The three-tiered plan was a major mistake,'' said Anita L.
Beaty, executive director of the Task Force for the Homeless, an
Atlanta advocacy group.
   Advocates and agencies should turn from shelter-oriented
services and concentrate on serving as many as possible at a low
cost, actively recruiting businesses to improve employment
opportunities and strengthening vagrancy and public nuisance laws,
Ms. Stoner said.
   ``Any consideration of constructing a non-homeless future shifts
the focus ... from shelters to explorations of permanent housing,''
Ms. Stoner said.
   The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates there are two
to three million homeless people in the United States _ with women
and children comprising about 60 percent.
   Los Angeles and New York have the highest number of homeless
people, with about 50,000 in each city, Ms. Stoner said.

   A cable car on a steep, damp hill above
Fisherman's Wharf lost its grip and rolled backward, hitting a car
and causing three minor injuries, officials said.
   The accident occurred on the Hyde Street hill, about a block
from a May 16 accident in which a runaway cable car hit a truck,
injuring 36 passengers.
   On Sunday, the car carrying 25 to 30 riders was headed up the
hill when it disengaged from the underground cable near Francisco
Street, officials said.
   The gripman applied the regular and emergency brakes, but the
car rolled backward into an automobile, which then hit a parked
auto. The cable car slid down the hill for about 200 feet before
stopping.
   Three passengers were treated for minor injuries at the scene,
and the damage to the two cars was minor, officials said. The cable
car was apparently undamaged.

   Agents seized about 5,000 pounds of pure cocaine
and $2 million in cash, including some stashed in bags marked
``Just Say No,'' authorities said in announcing one of the nation's
largest drug confiscations.
   Four people were arrested, including the local leader of a
Colombian drug cartel, authorities said Sunday.
   The cocaine, with an estimated street value of $400 million, was
the largest amount confiscated in New York City, said Robert M.
Stutman, special agent in charge of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration's office here.
   The largest cocaine shipment ever seized in the United States,
in Tampa, Fla., on April 28, involved 9,230 pounds found in plastic
containers that were concealed in hallowed-out lumber. The largest
in the New York City area occurred last month in Hicksville, where
agents discovered 6,000 pounds of cocaine hidden inside blocks of
chocolate from Ecuador.
   Only a few cocaine seizures nationally have exceeded 5,000
pounds. But Customs Service agents in 10 months have seized 10 tons
more cocaine than they did in all of the last fiscal year, Customs
Commissioner William von Raab said earlier this month.
   Among those arrested this weekend was Hernando Grajales Rizzo,
39, Colombia, a leader in the Cali drug cartel, Stutman said.
   Stutman would not say when or how the smugglers brought the
drugs into New York. The drugs were found in the Queens apartment
where Rizzo and two other men were arrested, officials said.
   The arrests were announced at a news conference where
authorities displayed small plastic-wrapped boxes containing the
5,000 pounds of cocaine and boxes of U.S. currency.
   Some of the money was in supermarket bags imprinted with the
Reagan administration's slogan, ``Just Say No To Drugs.''
   The arrests would likely cause the cartel to suffer a setback,
but not end its activity in the lucrative New York market,
officials said.
   ``I hope it will have an impact, but the amount of the drugs
coming in is very, very large,'' said Chief Raymond L. Jones of the
city Police Department's Organized Crime Control Bureau. ``The
problem is that a 2-pound, 2-ounce package, a kilo, can be broken
down to about 14,000 vials of crack. That is our major problem.''
   The suspects will be arraigned this week, authorities said.

<HEAD>Fragile Ties Between Jews and Arabs In Israel Unraveling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violent confrontations between Arabs and Jews
inside Israel have increased in recent weeks, threatening to
unravel fragile ties that have bound the two groups through
day-to-day contacts in the past 21 years.
   The incidents also prompt renewed concern that it will become
more and more difficult to confine the Palestinian uprising to the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Two weeks ago, an arsonist set fire to a construction site shack
in the Tel Aviv suburb Or Yehuda. Three Palestinians asleep in the
shack burned to death. Police later arrested a 17-year-old Jewish
suspect.
   On Sunday, police arrested seven Arabs on suspicion they threw
three firebombs and a smoke bomb into the backyard of an Or Yehuda
home.
   Also Sunday, a West Bank resident Palestinian and his two sons
were held on suspicion they hurled a hand grenade into a packed
outdoor mall in the mixed Jewish-Arab city of Haifa on Saturday.
The blast wounded 25 Israelis, including an 8-year-old boy whose
feet were blown off.
   In another incident, three Palestinians from the Gaza Strip were
held on suspicion of trying to drown two Jewish women near a Tel
Aviv beach.
   Also in Tel Aviv, a night watchman from the West Bank city of
Nablus told police he was beaten up by a gang of seven Jewish
youths while guarding a construction site last week.
   As the violence increases, so does the hatred between the two
communities.
   ``If we don't manage to control the situation, things might get
worse,'' Tel Aviv Police Chief Yigal Marcus told the Jerusalem
Post. ``The things happening now are not so unusual.''
   The national police force, already overextended because of
Jewish-Arab violence in Jerusalem and the northern Galilee area
with its large Arab population, had to deploy reinforcements in Or
Yehuda.
   But their presence has not calmed the hatred.
   ``So what if an Arab burned to death,'' Shuki Calif, 16, told
the Israeli Hadashot newspaper. ``What's an Arab anyway. He isn't
human. Let 2,000 more of them burn to death.''
   Many Palestinians have absorbed the message. Before Dec. 8, when
the uprising began, 105,000 Palestinians from the occupied lands
worked in Israel, most of them commuting to their jobs each day.
   Today the figure has dropped to 85,000, and many of those still
working in Israel are worried and angry.
   ``I was frightened when I heard about the three workers who were
burned to death,'' 25-year-old Issam Ismail, an aluminium factory
worker from Bethlehem, told The Associated Press. ``I was picturing
myself in their place, which is very possible these days.''
   Wael Yahyah Nafeh, 27, from the Kalandia refugee camp, said
Palestinian workers have always faced problems in Israel.
   ``It's nothing new to me,'' said Nafeh, who has worked for the
Israeli-owned Sonol gas company for the past six years. ``We have
been threatened since we were born. ... Only nowadays they don't do
you the honor of threatening, but kill or beat you straight away.''
   Legislator Amnon Linn, an Arab affairs expert in the
left-leaning Labor Party, denied Jewish violence against Arabs was
widespread.
   ``They are marginal groups on the fringes of Israeli society,''
Linn said of the Jewish assailants.
   But he warned the situation could deteriorate because of
incidents like Saturday's grenade attack in Haifa.
   ``If there is more of the same, more wounded, and if it should
emerge that an Arab from Haifa was involved, it will lead to
tensions and it will be hard to predict what might happen,'' said
Linn.
   Haifa's population of 243,000 includes 20,000 Arabs who hold
Israeli citizenship. In contrast with other areas of Israel, many
live in mixed neighborhoods with Jews.
   Maryan Meir, the father of two young boys seriously wounded in
the Haifa blast, denounced violence from either side.
   ``I don't know who threw it, Jews or Arabs, but whoever threw it
is below any level of humanity because whether there's a political
problem or not, he directed the grenade, and I saw this, toward my
children,'' Meir told Israel army radio.
   Most of the violence in Israel so far has involved Jews and
Palestinians from the lands seized from Egypt and Jordan in 1967.
But officials fear it could spread to Israel's 735,000 Arab
citizens.
   ``I hope the Jewish sector realizes the grenade attack was
carried out by three or four people, not an entire community,''
said Alexander Bligh, deputy adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir on Arab affairs. ``However, we are concerned about the
possibility of further acts of violence by Jews against Arabs.''

   A male dancer went too far during a
Chippendales nightclub striptease being watched by 120 women and
two undercover police officers, who arrested the performer for lewd
conduct, authorities said.
   Bernard Tavis, 23, was booked for investigation of committing
lewd acts, allegedly exposing himself, during his solo performance
Saturday night.
   Tavis was released on his own recognizance and ordered to appear
in court Sept. 14, said police Sgt. Kevin Kurzhals.
   David Levi, Chippendales general manager, said the arrest was
``another attempt by the police department to harass
Chippendales.'' The nightclub recently faced closure for allegedly
violating fire department regulations on overcrowding.
   ``The same act has been done at the club and on the `Donahue'
and `Geraldo' shows,'' he said.
   ``If it can be done on national television, I don't see why it
can't be done in a nightclub.''
   Tavis' arrest was in response to a complaint, said police
Officer Jack Rinallo, who declined to describe the alleged lewd act.

   Three teams of inspectors from the Soviet
Union were scheduled to arrive in the United States today to
conduct on-site inspections at two military bases under terms of
the treaty to eliminate medium- and shorter-range nuclear weapons,
according to a Defense Department official.
   The Soviet Union has notified us ``that three Soviet inspection
teams are to arrive at Travis Air Force Base to conduct baseline
inmspections,'' said Susan Franklin, a spokeswoman for the Defense
Department's On-Site Inspection Agency.
   Franklin said the Soviets notified the agency early Monday
morning that three 10-man teams were scheduled to arrive at 10:30
p.m. EDT today for the inspections under the terms of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty signed in December.
   The inspections would be conducted at Pueblo Army Depot in
Colorado and Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona said Franklin.
   The purpose of the Soviet inspections is to verify information
in diagrams of the sites and about the number of missiles provided
by U.S. officials.
   Under the accord the Soviet Union and the United States would
eliminate within three years all land-based missiles with ranges of
300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   Pueblo is as a repair center for Pershing II missiles, and the
Davis-Monthan base is a training center for ground-launched cruise
missiles. Both locations would serve as elimination sites said
Franklin.
   The first U.S. weapons destruction is to begin with the
solid-fuel rocket motors for the Pershing II missiles at the
Longhorn Army Ammunitions plant near Marshall, Texas on for Sept. 8.

   The Duke and Duchess of York named their
two-week-old daughter Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, Buckingham Palace
announced today.
   The baby, who is fifth in line to the throne, will be known as
Her Royal Highness The Princess Beatrice of York, the palace said.
   She is the first child of the former Sarah Ferguson and her
husband, Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Britain's newest princess is currently at Balmoral Castle, the
queen's summer home in Scotland, with her parents and grandparents.
   She was born Aug. 8, 1988 at 8:18 p.m., considered one of the
luckiest moments of the century by Chinese astrologers, and flew to
Scotland hours after leaving Portland Hospital in London with her
parents on Aug. 12.
   The name Beatrice _ which means bringer of joy _ has royal
roots. The youngest of Queen Victoria's nine children was named
Princess Beatrice.
   While the duke and duchess were deciding on a name, British
gamblers had a few ideas as well. But their top favorites,
Charlotte, Victoria, Annabel and Elizabeth, all turned out to be
losers.
   The tabloid Sun, Britain's largest-circulation paper, hit the
mark last Friday with a front-page banner headline revealing all
three of the baby's names correctly.
   The paper said Annabel was Andrew and Sarah's first choice but
the name was rejected by the queen as ``too yuppie.'' It said the
queen suggested the name Beatrice during a family gathering at
Balmoral.
   ``It was agreed to be the perfect compromise _ unusual enough to
please Fergie, but royal enough to please the queen,'' The Sun said.
   Princess Beatrice's second name, Elizabeth, is after her
grandmother, the queen, and her great-grandmother, Queen Mother
Elizabeth, who just celebrated her 88th birthday.
   The baby's third name, Mary, is the middle name of the duchess'
mother, Susan Barrantes, wife of Argentinian polo player Hector
Barrantes. It is also the name of Andrew's great-grandmother, Queen
Mary, wife of King George V.
   Taking two weeks to choose a name is not unusual in the royal
family.
   The queen's daughter, Princess Anne and her husband Mark
Phillips took more than three weeks to name their son, Peter, and
almost four weeks to name their daughter, Zara.
   Prince Charles and his wife Diana were comparatively quick to
name their children. Prince William, who is second in line to the
throne behind his father, was named eight days after his birth and
his younger brother, Prince Harry, who is third in line, was named
after 24 hours.
   But Charles himself was referred to as the ``infant son'' for
about a month after he was born on Nov. 14, 1948. His name was
announced the day before his christening on Dec. 14 of that year.

   South and North Korea were deadlocked
today after a third round of talks on a non-aggression agreement
and the Olympics, with no word on whether negotiations will resume.
   During their two-hour meeting the two sides again refused to
make any major changes in their positions and blamed each other for
blocking progress.
   The communist north is demanding to be a co-host of the Olympic
Games, while the south insists the north drop its demand and take
part in the Games in Seoul, which begin next month.
   Park Joon-kyu, the South Korean chief delegate, indicated there
may be no further talks until after the Olympics. He said that
after the talks he asked for a private meeting with Chon Kum Chol,
head of the North Korean delegation, to try to resolve the
differences.
   ``If there is no hope we will postpone the next meeting until
after the Olympics,'' he told reporters before the North Koreans
failed to respond to the south's request for the meeting.
   North Korea's delegation withdrew to consider Park's proposal
but did not respond by the set deadline and the South Korean
delegation returned to Seoul.
   The five-member delegations of lawmakers from each side met in
the North Korean building at the Panmunjom truce site straddling
the Demilitarized Zone dividing the two sides.
   Earlier meetings were held Saturday and Friday.
   Chon accused the south of blocking progress.
   ``South Korea's attitude is anti-unification. Their direction
and way of thinking is mistaken,'' he told reporters.
   South Korea called for urgent talks to be held in the North
Korean capital of Pyongyang from Aug. 29 to focus solely on trying
to resolve the Olympic issue while there was still time. The
Olympics begin Sept. 17 and Sept. 2 is the entry deadline for
athletes.
   The two Koreas, technically still at war, are archenemies with
hundreds of thousands of troops poised along the 150-mile border in
a state of constant tension.
   North Korea is demanding to co-host the Olympics, and wants
immediate talks involving the full legislatures of both sides to
draw up a non-aggression declaration.
   South Korea, which has said co-hosting of the Games is
impossible, wants talks involving select parliamentary delegations.
The south also wants to discuss a larger range of issues.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics if it is not
allowed to co-host the Games. South Korea fears the north may use
terrorism to disrupt the Games if it is not allowed to co-host.
   The International Olympic Committee says North Korea cannot
co-host the Games because they are awarded to a single city.
   The Korean peninsula was divided at the end of World War II.
North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War,
which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty being
signed.

   The Palestinian guerrilla group led by Abu
Nidal today claimed responsibility for a grenade attack that
injured 25 people in the Israeli port city of Haifa.
   Also today, the army said a Palestinian died of wounds sustained
in an overnight clash with Israeli troops that left four other
Palestinians wounded. Arab reports said Palestinians stayed off the
job for a second day to protest Israeli tax raids.
   In the northern city of Haifa, police on Sunday announced the
arrest of four West Bank Palestinians suspected of hurling a
grenade at a crowded sidewalk cafe Saturday night. Twenty-five
people were wounded.
   The Palestinian guerrilla group led by Abu Nidal claimed
responsibility for the attack. The claim came in a statement from
his Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction, published in the Beirut
independent newspaper An-Nahar.
   The statement dedicated the attack to Khalil Wazir, also known
as Abu Jihad, the military commander of the Palestine Liberation
Organization who was assassinated in a suburb of Tunis in April.
Israeli officials have privately acknowledged killing Wazir.
   Dan Meir, 8, was the most seriously injured in the grenade
attack. Both his feet were amputated and he suffered head wounds.
   Officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus identified the
Palestinian who died in the overnight clash as Ahmad Sharnobi, 22,
of Askar refugee camp. They also said three were injured.
   He was the third Palestinian fatality since Sunday and the 252nd
in violence since Dec. 8, when Palestinian revolted against two
decades years of Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Four Israelis have been killed.
   A military spokesman said violence erupted after security forces
entered the Askar camp ``for initiated operations'' aimed at
preventing riots during the strike. The spokesman refused to
elaborate.
   Arab news reports said the injuries came when plainclothes
security agents opened fire after activists warned Palestinians
through loudspeakers that Israelis were in the camp.
   After the incident, soldiers imposed a curfew on Askar, two
neighboring refugee camps and the city of Nablus, the army said.
The restrictions confined about 140,000 people to their homes.
   The Palestinian general strike was called in leaflets issued
earlier this month by the underground United National Leadership of
the Uprising.
   It shut down public transportation and shops in Israeli-annexed
Arab east Jerusalem and major cities in the occupied territories
including Nablus, Ramallah, Hebron and Bethlehem, Arab news reports
said.
   Near Bethlehem, a group of 17 masked Palestinian youths gathered
on the Hebron-Jerusalem highway and stoned dozens of Arab cars
carrying workers to jobs in Israel, forcing them to turn back.
   Associated Press reporter Haitham Hamad saw 14 cars with windows
smashed stopped along the highway near the Dheishe refugee camp.
   Leaflets said the strike was to protest Israel's confiscation of
the property or restriction of movement of Arabs who refused to pay
taxes.
   Tax boycotts have been a main element of the Palestinian revolt
against Israeli rule.
   Israel has deported 33 Palestinians since the beginning of the
uprising and an army spokesman said recently that about 5,500 Arabs
have been jailed, many without trial under administrative detention
orders.

<HEAD>New Pub Hours For England and Wales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AUDREY WOODS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pubs and bars throughout England and Wales will be
allowed to stay open through the afternoon starting today, ending a
73-year-old policy and arousing some fears of increased drunkenness
and violence.
   Pubs, clubs and hotel bars may now stay open on weekdays from 11
a.m. to 11 p.m. instead of closing between 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.
Sunday afternoon hours have been extended by one hour, from noon
until 3 p.m.
   In 1915 the government decreed the afternoon closing to curb
drinking by munitions workers. Parliament voted overwhelmingly in
April to do away with the old rules.
   But pubs do not have to change their hours if they do not want
to, and the National Licensed Victuallers' Association predicted
that almost half the 67,000 pubs in England and Wales would stick
to the old ways.
   Most back-street and country pubs will probably continue to call
``time'' on weekdays at 3 p.m.
   The Brewers' Society predicted at least 25,000 new jobs would be
generated by the longer drinking hours and that pubs would win back
lost trade from hamburger and pizza bars.
   Pub owners and brewers agree that pubs in seaside and tourist
towns and city bars will benefit most from increased trade.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said: ``I believe that the new
licensing hours will benefit society as a whole by giving people
greater freedom of choice. Most people drink sensibly and
responsibly and it makes no sense to deny them the opportunity to
enjoy a drink in the afternoon at the time they wish.''
   The government has faced stiff opposition from the health lobby
and critics who fear that drink-related crime, particularly drunken
violence by young rowdies and drunk driving, will increase.
   But champions of the new hours point out that extended hours in
Scotland, introduced over a decade ago, were followed by a reduced
incidence of drunkenness and violence. The Scottish Office said
licensing changes had little impact on alcohol abuse.
   In Northern Ireland most pubs increased alcohol sales during the
past year, in which pubs were allowed to open on Sundays for the
first time and open until later on weekdays.
   But pub owners say there has been no increase in hooliganism and
drunkenness. Northern Ireland has had all-day opening from Monday
to Saturday since 1922.
   The possible impact on the home has not been overlooked by the
press. The Sunday Mirror ran a tongue-in-cheek story this week
predicting that the extra drinking hour on Sunday threatened ``to
shake the fabric of British family life.''
   Wives preparing Sunday dinner can no longer ``even pretend to
believe the man who tells you that he's just popping out to post a
letter@take the dog for a walk.''

   Amtrak service was back to normal today after
service between New York and Washington was blocked for four hours
by a fire in the locomotive of a passenger train, officials said.
   The 172 passengers aboard an Amtrak Metroliner were evacuated to
a rear car at 8:10 p.m. Sunday. No injuries were reported, Amtrak
spokeswoman Marci Larson said. The cause has not been determined,
and an investigation is under way.
   Overhead electric lines were shut off while firemen extinguished
the blaze. The tracks were reopened about 10:50 p.m. Sunday, but
had to be closed again at 12:10 a.m. for more than an hour because
the fire flared up a second time, officials said. A dozen trains in
the busy corridor were delayed.
   Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Marciniak said morning traffic was
running normally.

<HEAD>Government Bans Anti-Conscription Organization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today banned a
nationwide organization opposed to conscription laws requiring
white men to serve in the armed forces.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, acting under
state-of-emergency regulations, said the End Conscription Campaign
was banned from carrying out any activities.
   Action against the organization was expected since 143 young
white men, in the broadest challenge ever of the conscription
system, announced Aug. 3 that they would refuse to perform
mandatory military service. Most of the men face six-year jail
terms.
   Leaders of the End Conscription Campaign denied involvement in
organizing the mass resistance, but Defense Minister Magnus Malan
said he held the group responsible for the ``subversive action.''
   The organization appealed unsuccessfully for a system of
alternative, non-military service for men politically or morally
opposed to joining the army.
   It has argued that no one should be forced to serve
involuntarily in the army units that patrol black townships or in
the forces combating pro-independence guerrillas in South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Vlok, in a statement, said the End Conscription Campaign's
primary purpose was to undermine public support for the armed
forces.
   ``The ECC attempts to create an impression of political
neutrality,'' Vlok said. ``But it is not difficult to see the
organization's role in the revolutionary onslaught against South
Africa.''
   The End Conscription Campaign was formed in 1983, and many of
its members were detained or restricted since a national state of
emergency was declared in June 1986.
   In February, the organization said it suspected army involvement
in a harassment campaign that included anonymous telephone calls,
smear pamphlets and vandalism of members' property.
   South Africa's conscription laws allow conscientious objection
only for religious reasons, not on political or moral grounds. Only
whites are subject to conscription _ military service for other
races is voluntary.
   Vlok said the End Conscription Campaign's effort had been
endorsed by the African National Congress, the outlawed guerrilla
group waging a sabotage and bombing campaign aimed at ending
apartheid and overthrowing the South African government.
   Vlok also said the End Conscription Campaign had assisted draft
dodgers, helping them obtain residence permits to live in Britain.
   The government no longer disclosed how many men refuse to serve
in the military. In 1985, the last year figures were disclosed,
7,589 men declined to serve.
   The ban on the End Conscription Campaign is similar to bans
imposed in February on 17 anti-apartheid organizations. Under the
bans, the organizations are allowed to exist in name only.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A handgun found next to the body of
President Lazarus Salii had been given to him four months earlier
at his request by a member of his security team, authorities said.
   ``I don't know why he requested it,'' presidential aide
Bonifacio Basilius said Sunday.
   Salii, 54, was found with a single gunshot wound to the head in
the living room of his home on Saturday, a day before he was
scheduled to announce his candidacy for re-election. He was
pronounced dead about an hour later.
   He was the second president of the Western Pacific island
republic, and the second to die by gunfire within three years.
   ``We're not ruling out anything,'' Basilius said when asked if
the shooting was murder or suicide.
   Guam's chief medical examiner, Dr. Hee Yong Park, planned to
assist in an autopsy tonight of Salii to determine if the fatal
shooting was a suicide or assassination.
   Dr. Victor Yano had planned to perform the autopsy this morning
while in telephone contact with Park. But Park decided to make the
1,000-mile flight to Palau after consulting with Yano, Basilius
said.
   The gun, a .357-caliber Magnum, will be taken to the FBI
laboratory in Washington by agent Robert Heafner, Palau Attorney
General Philip Isaac said.
   Chester Pavolvski, the U.S. State Department representative in
Palau, said the police investigation indicated a self-inflicted
wound.
   A state funeral has been scheduled for Friday.
   Thomas Remengesau Sr., Palau's vice president, was sworn in as
president Saturday.
   Salii was elected in August 1985, shortly after President Haruo
Remeliik was shot to death outside his house. Three men were
convicted of killing Remeliik, but were acquitted on appeal.
   In April, U.S. Rep. Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., and Ron de Lugo,
the non-voting representative in Congress of the U.S. Virgin
Islands, charged that Salii and two other Palau officials were paid
$475,000 in 1983 and 1984 out of a $32 million loan made by British
banks to Palau for construction of a power plant.
   Salii acknowledged receiving $100,000 from Gordon Mochrie,
managing director of International Power Systems Co. Ltd. (IPSECO)
of London, but said the money was paid to a travel agency he owned
to be used for a potential airline in Palau. The airline never came
into being.
   Udall and de Lugo wrote to Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, charging that several
senior Palauan government officials have been connected to shipment
of Southeast Asian heroin through Palau. They did not elaborate on
those charges.
   A federal judge in New York ruled Aug. 8 that Palau must pay an
international consortium of banks more than $44 million on
defaulted loans for the IPSECO power plant.
   Palau, with a population of about 15,000, has been administered
by the United States as part of a far-flung United Nations
strategic trusteeship since 1947.
   Palau's effort to negotiate an independent political
relationship with the United States has been stymied by opponents
of nuclear weapons. Palau's constitution bans nuclear weapons or
power plants, unless approved by 75 percent of the voters. A
proposed compact of free association, which would permit U.S. Navy
ships to call in Palau, has never received more than 73 percent
approval.

<HEAD>AIDS Victim Ryan White Appears in Movie On His Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teen-age AIDS victim Ryan White sat at
his kitchen table back in Indiana with a couple of Hollywood film
makers, eating pizza and reading a new movie script about his
celebrated fight to return to school.
   At one point, Ryan recalled, director John Herzfeld asked him to
read the part of another young AIDS victim who had befriended him
while they were in the hospital.
   Ryan didn't know it, but he was auditioning for the role. He got
it.
   ``He's a natural,'' said Linda Otto, co-executive producer of
``The Ryan White Story,'' an ABC movie starring George C. Scott
which is being filmed in Statesville through Sept. 9.
   To Ryan, his small role in the film reinforces the message that
AIDS cannot be transmitted through casual contact. ``It tells the
story, plus it helps educate people about AIDS and the hardships
people go through,'' he said in an interview Friday.
   Ryan will appear as an older hemophiliac who, like Ryan,
contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion.
   ``He didn't have a very positive outlook,'' Ryan said about his
friend who died from the disease. The film will not depict Chad's
death.
   The role of Ryan is being played by Lucas Haas, who starred
opposite Harrison Ford in ``Witness.'' Judith Light of ``Who's the
Boss?'' stars as Ryan's mother, Jeanne. Scott plays the part of the
family's attorney, Charles Vaughn.
   The softspoken Ryan said it hasn't been difficult to work on a
movie about his struggle with a deadly disease and the anguish his
family went through in 1985 when residents of his native Kokomo,
Ind., wanted to keep him from entering school.
   ``It's kind of weird seeing someone else playing my life,'' he
said with a smile Friday at the Iredell County Courthouse, where
the court scenes depicting the Whites' legal battles were being
filmed.
   Ryan is 16 now but looks younger because of his small size.
Slouched back in his chair, he looks like any other teen-ager with
his untied high-top sneakers and close-cropped haircut.
   He is, however, far from typical.
   ``He never feels sorry for himself,'' Ms. Otto said. ``And he
doesn't want anyone else to feel sorry for him. I've learned so
much from being around him.''
   The movie will describe some of the legal and other battles the
family went through since Ryan contracted AIDS in 1984. It follows
his attempts to return to school, a controversy that divided the
residents of Kokomo and forced the Whites to eventually leave town.
   The film ends with Ryan's first day of classes at Hamilton
Heights High School in Arcadia, Ind. Ryan was scheduled to fly back
home to Cicero early in the week so he can be ready for the start
of school.
   Until then, he will continue to hang around the set.
   ``The crew is in love with him,'' Ms. Otto said.
   While the movie's focus is a young boy with a fatal disease, it
also is a testimony to his vigor and spirit.
   ``This is not a story about a boy dying of AIDS,'' Ms. Otto
said. ``It's the story of a boy living with AIDS and how a town was
polarized by it. It's a microcosm of what it was like in this
country three years ago, and, to some extent, what it's still like
now.
   ``This is not a movie about a family's tragedy,'' she said.
``It's a family miracle. I'm totally inspired by having known the
Whites.''

<HEAD>Muck Restored In New Edition Of Sinclair's `Jungle'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new edition of Upton Sinclair's ``The
Jungle,'' an expose of squalid conditions in the Chicago
stockyards, will restore whole chapters cut to make the book more
marketable, a book historian says.
   Sinclair cut his original manuscript by a third for the 1906
Doubleday, Page edition which caused meat sales to slump and
spurred President Theodore Roosevelt to order an investigation that
led to the nation's first Pure Food and Drug Act.
   Gene DeGruson, a professor and curator of rare books at
Pittsburg (Kan.) State University, was quoted in today's New York
Times as saying that, considering the material that was expunged
from the original, ``it's amazing that the published book had any
impact whatsoever.''
   ``Despite his protestations that he wished the novel published
as he had written it, revision was drastic,'' DeGruson wrote in the
introduction to the new edition, due in October from St. Luke's
Press of Memphis, Tenn.
   Most of the deletions pertained to socialism, but paragraphs
criticizing the press and derogatory comments about ``big
business,'' self-made men, captains of industry and marriage also
were deleted.
   DeGruson said he pieced together the original novel from a
truckload of rotting paper given to him in 1980 by a young man who
had been hired to clean out the cellar of a nearby farm. The
original novel had been serialized in a weekly newspaper, The
Appeal, but the special edition that contained the final eight
chapters and the conclusion had been lost until DeGruson found it
among the papers from the farm.
   Sinclair died in a Bound Brook, N.J., nursing home in 1968 at
the age of 90 _ one year after he returned to the White House to
watch President Johnson sign the Wholesome Meat Act, an expansion
of the bill his book inspired.

and chanting ``Solidarity'' seized control of the Lenin shipyard
today, joining a wave of strikes that poses the most serious
challenge to communist authorities since 1981.
   The Lenin shipyard became the 13th enterprise in a week to go on
strike for higher pay and government recognition of Solidarity, the
trade federation that was suppressed under martial law in 1981.
   At least 10 coal mines in southern Poland and transit and
dockworkers in Szczecin remained on strike on the seventh day of
the labor unrest, which has idled more than 76,000 workers.
   Some Gdansk port workers also were striking as of today,
according to reports from Western journalists. A Solidarity
spokesman, Jacek Kuron, said 3,000 Gdansk dockworkers were on
strike.
   Aside from the shipyard, which employs 10,000 people, no new
strikes were confirmed by authorities today. But there were many
opposition reports of labor unrest nationwide.
   Activists in Warsaw reported an attempt to start a strike at the
14,000-worker Ursus tractor plant outside the city. A rally at the
plant was dispersed by police during the morning shift, resulting
in three detentions, said activist Maciej Jankowski. But he said
workers laid down tools in some departments.
   A management spokesman at Ursus who did not give his name
confirmed an unsuccessful attempt to strike at the plant, but made
no mention of police and said work continued normally.
   In southeastern Poland, Solidarity organizer Ewa Kuberna said
workers rallied at the 18,000-employee Stalowa Wola steel mill and
heavy machinery plant, and a strike was launched by 2,000 of the
workers.
   Government spokesman Ryszard Straus said people might be
standing around at Stalowa Wola but it did not necessarily mean a
strike.
   Opposition spokesman Wojciech Maziarski also reported new
strikes or partial strikes at the Cegielski turbine works in
Poznan, the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw and the Railroad
Construction Enterprise of Szczecin.
   A spokesman for Huta Warszawa mill, technical director Stanislaw
Zalesny, said about 50 people tried to mount a strike but it
failed. Straus said he had no information about any stoppages at
Cegielski or the Szczecin railroad enterprise.
   There was no police interference as workers marched around the
Gdansk shipyard carrying Polish national flags and took over the
main gate at 8:35 a.m. Late this morning, however, riot police
cordoned off approaches to the shipyard.
   Strikers chanted Solidarity slogans and posted strike banners on
the shipyard fence, helping some supporters who had been locked out
to scramble over the gate.
   A short time later, Solidarity national chairman Lech Walesa
arrived.
   ``We must fight for reforms. We must fight for Solidarity. There
is no other way,'' Walesa exhorted strikers in a 20-minute rally at
the gate.
   ``Everything is closed and the whole shipyard is on strike,''
Walesa said later by telephone from his Gdansk home.
   He said the enthusiasm of the young strikers surprised him.
``This youth we have there is just incredible.''
   Walesa blamed the strikes on authorities, whom he said have
refused to engage in dialogue with workers.
   ``I wanted to avoid strikes,'' he said. ``We shouldn't be
striking. We should be working. But there was no other choice. ...
We are still waiting for serious talks.''
   None of the shipyard's towering cranes appeared to be operating,
and a foreman speaking through a fence stated that all departments
were shut down.
   Workers could be seen strolling, taking naps or perching on
fences and walls around the yard. Straus confirmed that the
government considered the shipyard on strike.
   ``If you work only eight hours a day, you make 40,000 zlotys
($89) a month, and that's not enough to make a living,'' said one
man in his mid-20s, asked why he joined the strike.
   The shipyard, where Solidarity began eight years ago this month,
also was the scene of a strike in May that ended inconclusively. In
Poland, striking workers generally go to their plants but do not
work.
   Not since the labor unrest that led to the 1981 military
crackdown on Solidarity have authorities had to confront strikes on
such a scale. Wages are lagging far behind 60 percent inflation,
which is aggravated by average 40 price increases.
   The government-controlled media has called the strikes illegal
and stressed their rising cost to the economy. Coal is Poland's
leading export and a major source of hard currency to service its
$39 billion foreign debt.
   The government, which has refused to negotiate with Solidarity,
has not stated how it intends to deal with the strikes.
   Solidarity, only independent labor federation ever allowed in
the Soviet bloc, was founded in the Gdansk shipyard in 1980 after a
nationwide strike wave. It was outlawed in October 1982.
   Labor unrest stemming in part from government price increases
have three times toppled governments in communist post-war Poland:
in 1956, 1970 and 1980.

   Hundreds of thousands of people rallied
today in Burma to demand an end to authoritarian rule, and heavily
armed soldiers stopped protesters from marching across the capital
of Rangoon, diplomats and news reports said.
   In the northern city of Mandalay, hundreds of thousands of
people, including housewives and children, filled the streets in
response to student calls for a nationwide protest and a general
strike, Japan's Kyodo news service said.
   Some protesters waved the fighting peacock flag used in the
struggle for independence from Britain in the 1940s.
   Many train and bus operators joined the strike, bringing public
transportation to a halt, the report said.
   Soldiers closed off key areas of Rangoon and stopped thousands
of demonstrators from marching there, witnesses and diplomats said.
   An Asian diplomat said about 20,000 people heeded student calls
and rallied outside Rangoon General Hospital in the largest
demonstration in the capital since rioting culminated in the
resignation of President Sein Lwin on Aug. 12. There were no
reports of violence today in Rangoon.
   Sein Lwin was replaced by President Maung Maung, the country's
first civilian leader in 26 years.
   Kyodo reported from Rangoon that a group of protestors rallied
in front of the U.S. Embassy, saying: ``We want our movement to be
communicated to countries around the world.''
   The protesters are demanding an end to one-party rule in Burma.
   In the southern city of Victoria Point near the Thai border,
thousands of demonstrators marched to the town hall, chanting
slogans condemning one-party rule, a senior Thai police official
said.
   Rebels fighting the government threw their support behind the
students.
   The Asian diplomat said the demonstrators gathered peacefully in
downtown Rangoon. He said most shops in the capital were open in
the morning, despite student calls for a nationwide general strike,
but closed as the rally began.
   The diplomat, who demanded anonymity, said about 10,000
demonstrators remained outside the hospital early tonight.
   ``When about half of those taking part in the rally set out to
march, they were blocked by soldiers,'' he said by telephone.
   The diplomat was not sure how the marchers were turned away.
   A Burmese source reached by telephone in Rangoon said soldiers
closed off parts of the city with barbed wire and other barricades,
evidently to block any mass marches.
   The source, who requested anonymity, said thousands gathered
peacefully in front of Rangoon General Hospital, listening to
speeches by protest leaders, and the numbers were increasing
steadily.
   The Thai police official said 10,000 demonstrators gathered at
Victoria Point, some with red cloths tied around their heads as a
symbol of defiance. The market town is in Burma's southernmost
province of Megui bordering Thailand's Ranong province, and is 490
miles southeast of Rangoon.
   During the Aug. 8-12 rioting, security forces there turned
against the government and gave protesters free reign, Thai
officials said.
   Also today, the Karen Nation Union, one of the strongest rebel
groups, issued a statement in Bangkok declaring support for the
students and calling on foriegn nations to halt aid to the Burmese
government until it ends one-party rule.
   Rebels hold large areas bordering Thailand. Last week, Brang
Seng, a leader the National Democratic Front grouping 10 guerrilla
armies, also declared the front would join the students fighting
for democracy.
   On Friday, Maung Maung, the Western-educated attorney general,
succeeded Sein Lwin and became the nation's first civilian leader
since a 1962 military coup toppled an elected government and
instituted one-party rule.
   But students and other groups were not satisfied and immediately
called for more demonstrations and the general strike today to
press demands for multi-party democracy. Diplomats in Rangoon say
the government is highly unlikely to give in to such demands.
   Burma has been in turmoil since September, when university
students rioted in the most serious student unrest in the country
since 1974. They were protesting the government's voiding of some
60 percent of the currency in circulation, a move that brought
severe hardship in a nation where the per capita income of less
than $200 a year is among the world's lowest.
   Bloody rioting, increasingly focused on political demands,
occurred in March and June, leading to the resignation of Ne Win.
   Sein Lwin is said to have personally ordered the suppression of
those protests.
   Under Ne Win, the Burma Socialist Program Party pursued ruinous
policies of rigid socialism, strict military control and
international isolationism.
   Security forces have not interferred with the demonstrations and
after Sein Lwin's departure, authorities have indicated they will
be much more tolerant of dissent.

<HEAD>Couple Finds Last Works Of Sculptor Douglas Tilden</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who paid $100 for a stack of
sealed boxes at a grab bag auction believes they have uncovered one
of the most exciting finds in California art history.
   Jack and Linda Liberati, who bought the crates on an impulse at
a Bekins Van and Storage Co., auction, found they contained 70
plaster-of-paris statues, paintings, sketches and other works by
artist Douglas Tilden, a sculptor who died in obscurity after
capturing international acclaim at the turn of the century.
   The couple, who indicated they hope to sell the collection, had
no idea what was in the boxes when they bought them last spring at
an auction.
   ``I thought they were tool boxes,'' Liberati said Sunday.
   Inside were casts of statues of historic figures including
Father Junipero Serra and dozens of diplomas and prizes all bearing
the name Douglas Tilden.
   The next day, Liberati went to the public library and discovered
that Tilden died broke and forgotten in his Berkeley studio in 1935
after winning international fame for his monumental public
sculptures, including the Mechanics Monument, the Admissions Day
Monument and a heroic group honoring the Spanish-American War, all
statues along San Francisco's Market Street.
   They learned Tilden was a deaf mute and, according to one
newspaper obituary, ``the greatest and most tragic of California
sculptors.''
   The Liberatis say the 20 crates contain works found in Tilden's
studio the day he died at the age of 75.
   Among the casts is a piece Tilden never cast but had planned to
call ``The Bridge,'' showing a young man and woman kneeling in an
embrace across the waters of the San Francisco Bay.
   ``When the bridge is finished,'' Tilden wrote, ``I shall place
this on Telegraph Hill to live with the bridge forever.''
   When monumental sculpture went out of style, Tilden never
regained the acclaim he knew as a youth. By 1930, he was destitute
and died five years later in a studio where the electricity had
been cut off.

<HEAD>Soviets Say U.S. Indirectly To Blame For Zia's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet commentator today rejected suggestions
that the Kremlin or its Afghan allies were responsible for the
plane crash that killed Pakistan's president, saying the United
States was indirectly to blame.
   Yuri Glukhov wrote in today's edition of the Communist Party
daily Pravda that President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq had created
dangerous conditions in his country through the assistance of the
United States.
   ``On Pakistani territory are dozens of bases where inveterate
terrorist cut-throats train,'' Glukhov wrote.
   He did not say whether he thinks the United States was directly
involved in Wednesday's plane crash that killed Zia and U.S.
Ambassador Arnold Raphel. He said an inquiry would have to be
completed to determine whether sabotage was involved.
   Zia, Raphel and 28 others died when the C-130 transport plane
exploded after takeoff following a field inspection of new
U.S.-built battle tanks about 30 miles west of the Indian border,
near the Pakistani city of Bahawalpur.
   Pakistan serves as a base for Moslem guerrillas fighting the
Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan. The United States also
backs the insurgents, and Glukhov alluded to this in a veiled
accusation against the United States.
   ``There are grounds to believe that the U.S.A. played a fatal
role in Zia's fate. It is the U.S.A. that prevented Pakistan from
getting out of a chronic crisis and achieving stability,'' the
commentator wrote.
   He said without elaborating that U.S. pressure had drawn
Pakistan into an undeclared war against Afghanistan.
   The new Pakistani president, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, has said the
crash was an act of sabotage but declined to speculate on who might
be responsible.
   Several Pakistani newspapers published unsourced reports that
officials believed the plane was hit by a missile. Others reported
they suspected a bomb in the cockpit. Still others said explosives
may have been concealed in a basket of mangos.
   Pravda quoted the Times of London as saying in an editorial that
if an investigation shows the crash resulted from a bomb explosion,
then Afghan communists and their Soviet allies should be suspected.
Glukhov said such accusations reflect the ``incompetence'' of
people trying to ``throw a shadow'' over Afghan and Soviet efforts
to bring peace to the region.

   An Irish soldier of the U.N. peacekeeping
force in south Lebanon accidentally shot and killed himself while
cleaning his rifle, a U.N. statement said today.
   Pvt. Patrick Wright, 27, was hit in the stomach Sunday, the
statement said. He was flown by helicopter to a U.N. field hospital
in the Lebanese border town of Naqoura but died a short while later.
   The shooting occurred in the village of Haddassa, which is
located within the area where the Irish battalion of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon is stationed.
   Wright is the 156th U.N. peacekeeper to die since the 5,800
troops were deployed in south Lebanon in 1978 to serve as a buffer
between guerrillas and Israel. He was the 25th member of the
600-strong Irish battalion to die in the region.
   The U.N. force is made up of troops from France, Ireland,
Norway, Sweden, Finland, Nepal, Ghana, Fiji and Senegal.

<HEAD>Quayle: No Strings Pulled in Law School Admission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., said today that even
though he was a mediocre, ``proverbial C+ student'' in college, his
influential family didn't pull strings to get him admitted to law
school.
   ``There's been nothing that has been substantiated that any
rules were violated, that we did anything that was unfair,'' Quayle
said, responding to questions on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''
about how he entered Indiana University Law School in 1970 and the
National Guard in 1969.
   Quayle, the 41-year-old Republican vice presidential nominee,
made his comments the day after The Plain Dealer in Cleveland
reported that Quayle had not met the admissions requirements for
the law school, but gained entrance after meeting with the
admissions dean, a Republican judge in a city where Quayle's family
owned the local newspaper.
   The Plain Dealer said the meeting came after Quayle had been
rejected by the law school.
   Quayle acknowledged today that he was not a stellar student at
DePauw University from which he graduated in 1969. But he said he
always wanted to attend law school.
   ``My grades in college were not good,'' he said. ``I was your
proverbial C+ student. I wish I had been more serious in college, I
have to confess that.''
   In the same interview, Quayle rejected the notion that he tried
to avoid the Vietnam War by joining the National Guard.
   ``The point is that I was willing to serve. I served in the
National Guard, had my unit been called to Vietnam, like other
units in Indiana were called to Vietnam, I would have served and
served with distinction, I hope.''
   The issue of Quayle's service in the guard was raised Sunday by
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who had been in the running to serve as
George Bush's No. 2 until Bush picked Quayle.
   Dole, who lost the use of an arm as a result of a injury
suffered in World War II, said that in his generation ``You knew
who was in the guard and who was in uniform fighting for their
country.'' Dole said that many people in his home state are ``very
sensitive about it. They didn't have anybody they could call. They
couldn't influence anyone.''
   On the issue of Quayle's entrance into night law school in the
fall of 1970, The Plain Dealer said it confirmed in an interview
with Quayle's father, James C. Quayle, that the school admitted
Quayle despite an academic record at DePauw that fell below the law
school's entrance requirements.
   ``They weren't going to accept him. He didn't fit their
criterion,'' said the elder Quayle, publisher of the Huntington
(Ind.) Herald-Press. ``So Danny went down there and talked to the
dean. He talked his way in. Danny, he's a pretty good salesman.''
   In 1972, the admissions dean, G. Kent Frandsen, conducted
Quayle's marriage ceremony to Marilyn Tucker, also a law student,
at her parents' home.
   Frandsen was a Republican city judge in Lebanon, Ind., where the
Quayle-Pulliam family owns the local newspaper. Frandsen also
became Quayle's campaign manager in Boone County in his 1986 Senate
race.
   The school's admissions committee reviewed at least 1,200
applications in 1970 and offered admission to 450 students to fill
275 openings, Frandsen said.
   Cleon H. Foust, now retired dean of the law school, called entry
requirements strict. Undergraduate grades were about twice as
important as scores on the national law school admissions test
(LSAT), he said.
   Foust recalls no pressure to admit Quayle. Letters of
recommendation written on Quayle's behalf are in school files,
which are not made public.
   The law school required a minimum grade point average of 2.6 (on
a 4.0 scale) at the time Quayle entered, The Washington Post
reported.
   The Plain Dealer and the Post also reported over the weekend
that an executive who worked for Quayle's late grandfather, Eugene
C. Pulliam, owner of Indiana's largest newspapers, arranged an
interview for Quayle with Theodore L. Sendak, then attorney general
of the state.
   Quayle, then 22, attending night classes at law school and
serving in the National Guard on weekends, was thinking about
taking a city government job in Indianapolis. But the senator's
father asked Medford S. Evans, editor and political columnist of
Pulliam's Indianapolis News, to find the young man ``something
better,'' The Plain Dealer reported.
   ``He said he got him a interview with Ted Sendack, the attorney
general. I said, OK, fine, and I told Danny to go down there,''
recalled James Quayle.
   Quayle became chief investigator in the attorney general's
consumer office and later administrative assistant to Edgar
Whitcomb, then Indiana's Republican governor.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chriss Gittens, who performed for 35 years in the
British Broadcasting Corp.'s long-running radio serial ``The
Archers,'' has died at age 86.
   Gittens, who had a heart attack in 1959, had been in a nursing
home since the beginning of the month. The BBC said he died Sunday
in his sleep.
   Gittens played the irascible old countryman Walter Gabriel in a
series heard by 7 million listeners every weeknight. Anyone who
misses an episode can tune in to a Sunday ``omnibus'' edition of
the week's highlights.
   ``The Archers,'' concerning the everyday dramas of life in
fictional Ambridge in the English Midlands, began in 1951.
   Gittens, who was also an electrician for many years, made
appearances in the early days of the program as a policeman, a bank
manager and various government inspectors. He joined the permanent
cast in 1953, on the death of the actor who created the character
of Walter Gabriel.
   Over the years, he made the role his own. Gittens will not be
replaced, the BBC's head of network radio for the Midlands, Jock
Gallagher, said Sunday.
   ``We wouldn't think for a minute of casting someone else in that
part,'' he said.
   David Hatch, managing director of BBC network radio, said:
``Chriss was one of the great personalities. He created a character
that will live in the minds and hearts of listeners for a long time
to come. There are not many actors in soap operas who achieve the
kind of affection that Chriss established for that rascal Walter.''

<TEXT>
   One zoo-hatched Andean condor died in transit
to a wilderness area but three others survived for an experiment
intended to show the best way to reintroduce endangered California
condors into the wild.
   The surviving birds were safely placed in secret holding pens
Saturday in Los Padres National Forest, and more Andean condors
will be taken to the area in October, said Joe Dowhan, condor
recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The dead bird was sent to San Diego for an autopsy, Dowhan said.
   He said its death will have little effect on the program. ``In
some ways, you kind of want things to go wrong now instead of
later,'' he said.
   The South American birds, all females to prevent breeding in the
wild, are being used to test techniques biologists hope to use to
begin returning the California condor to the wild after their
numbers are increased in a captive breeding program.
   Only 28 California condors are known to survive, all in
captivity at the San Diego Wild Animal Park and the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The Andean condor was chosen for the experiment because it is
the closest living relative to the California condor. Though the
Andean condors are also endangered, they number in the thousands.
   Scientists are conducting the experiment to see how birds
hatched in captivity adapt to freedom and fend for themselves
without native birds of their species to serve as examples.
   The 3- and 4-month-old birds will spend several weeks in mesh
enclosures in the forest 75 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   When the Andean birds are able to fly, around November,
scientist will fit them with radio transmitters, release them and
monitor their progress.
   The Andean birds will remain in the wild until it's time to
release California condors, perhaps as early as 1992 if the captive
breeding program continues to succeed, Dowhan said.

<TEXT>
   Authorities in the tiny central African
nation of Burundi said today at least 5,000 people were killed in
ethnic clashes that sent 35,000 people fleeing across the border.
   ``They've been able to get back into the hills and determine the
extent of the massacre,'' a senior Western diplomat told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from Burundi's capital,
Bujumbura.
   He said Burundi's foreign minister, Cyprien Mbonimpa, issued the
government's first official estimate of the number killed in last
week's massacre in a communique given to foreign diplomats at a
morning briefing.
   ``It indicated the government's latest body count, the number of
those killed, now is about 5,000,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on
condition he not be further identified.
   Mbonimpa described as ``highly exaggerated'' a media report that
at least 24,000 people had been killed in the fighting that began
Aug. 14 between the Hutu, Burundi's majority tribe, and the Tutsi,
the minority tribe that controls the military and rules the
country, the diplomat said.
   ``From every report, including those from non-governmental
sources, no one believes that figure,'' he said.
   State-run Radio Kigali today said 35,000 people escaped the
fighting by fleeing to Burundi's northern neighbor, Rwanda.
   The radio, monitored in Nairobi, said Burundi officials on
Sunday met Rwandan officials at Rwanda's southern border town of
Butare, where the refugees are gathered.
   It gave no details of the discussions, but said the Rwandan
officials promised the Burundi officials they would not allow
anyone to use their territory to stage attacks on Burundi.
   Burundi has claimed last week's violence was caused by
expatriate Hutus who infiltrated northern Burundi from foreign
countries and incited the resident Hutu population to massacre the
Tutsis.
   Peace was restored to the area within a day after the army moved
in, the government has said.
   The Hutu and the Tutsi are long-time enemies. Following an
abortive coup attempt in 1972 in Burundi, a former Belgium colony,
the Tutsi massacred 100,000 to 300,000 Hutu, including most of the
tribe's intelligentsia.
   Burundi has said most of last week's victims were Tutsi, but an
exiled opposition group, the Hutu People Liberation Party, accused
the Tutsi-dominated military of massacring Hutus. A diplomatic
source said there was no evidence of this.
   Hutu account for more than 90 percent of the population in the
northern area around two communes known as Marangara and Ntega
where most of the killings occurred. Burundi is mostly rural and
people reside in such communes.
   Burundi and Rwanda are among the world's most densely populated
nations, and Rwandan officials said its resources were being
strained by the large influx of refugees.
   Nearly 5 million people live in Burundi, which is about the size
of the state of Maryland. Eighty-four percent of its people are
Hutu, with the remainder Tutsi. The same percentages apply to the 6
million people in Rwanda, which is slightly smaller in size than
Burundi.
   Burundi's official communique ``promised to work with and try to
assist the refugees to fled to Rwanda to try to return them to
their homes as soon as possible,'' according to the Western
diplomat.
   The communique said the government had the situation under
control and that the military, the ruling Union of National
Progress party and the bureaucracy had been ordered to ``show
restraint,'' the diplomat said.
   ``It said the policy of the government was one of respect for
human rights and of ethnic reconciliation,'' he said.
   There is a 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew throughout Burundi, a ban on
meetings of more than five people and restriction on travel between
towns.

   The secret to championship whistling is
just ``pucker up and start blowing,'' says the winner of the
11th-annual International Whistle-Off competition.
   Roy Thoreson, a 57-year-old Canadian Pacific Railway brakeman
from Calgary, Alberta, overcame stomach flu Sunday to top a field
of 30 contestants for his fourth grand championship.
   He wins a round-trip air fare to Mexico or the Caribbean.
   Whistlers from 15 states and Canada competed in what's billed as
the nation's premier whistling event.
   Top female whistlers were Patty Ediger of Dayton, Ore., who won
the solo popular female division and finished second in the
classical female division, and L'Vai Kildow, who won the dual
division and classical female division.
   Sean Lomax, a Navy officer stationed at Pearl Harbor, brought
the audience to its feet with his excerpt from Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony, but was awarded second in the solo classical male
category.
   Boos and catcalls from the crowd greeted the judges' decision
and division winner Ugo Conti of El Cerrito, Calif., agreed as he
handed over his first-place trophy to Lomax.
   ``I think he's the best,'' said Conti, who won with a
Bach-Vivaldi medley.
   ``I hope that one day we can have a competition where the person
who is the people's choice is the winner,'' said Lomax, who paid
the air fare for himself and his family to fly to his third
Whistle-Off.
   Thoreson whistled ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' and ``Sweet
Georgia Brown'' to capture first in the solo popular male division.
   His juggling and magic acts while whistling the circus tune,
``Day at Fair,'' brought a second in the novelty division, and
Brahms' ``Hungarian Dance Number Five'' gave him third in the solo
classical male division.
   Thoreson said he began whistling at the age of 6 and ``practiced
40 years before getting on stage'' in 1977.
   ``People ask me all the time how to whistle and all I say is
`pucker up and start blowing,''' he said. ``I really think
whistling is a God-given gift like opera singing.''
   Another top whistler, Robert Larson of Minneapolis, captured
first in the novelty division with his renditions of John Phillip
Sousa's rousing ``El Capitan'' and ``Stars and Stripes'' marches.
   Larson, the event's grand champion in 1986, dressed as a band
conductor with hat and plume and held a piccolo to his lips as he
whistled the songs.
   He also had the crowd clapping in his second-place finish behind
Thoreson in the solo popular male division with a fast Frankie
Yankovich tune, ``Litchensteiner Polka.''
   ``When I get to the ya-ya-yaing, I want you to do it fast with
me,'' he told the crowd, which eagerly ya-ya-yaed.

   Marisol Ureaneta hates being fussed over, but
that didn't stop her fiance from rolling out a red carpet to
welcome her back to the United States.
   ``I've missed her terribly,'' said Bruce Plotnick, 29, of Great
Neck, explaining the elaborate, romantic welcome he engineered at
Kennedy International Airport Sunday afternoon.
   Plotnick and Miss Ureaneta, 25, from Caracas, Venezuela, met
while she was a business student at C.W. Post College on Long
Island. He visited her last April in Caracas, and proposed over the
telephone a few months ago.
   She accepted, but couldn't leave her family immediately.
   So when the day of her arrival finally came, Plotnick brought a
red carpet to the airport, along with two cellists he'd hired and a
baritone to sing ``Some Enchanted Evening.''
   He passed out song sheets for anyone at the airport who wanted
to join in and issued streamers and confetti to children. A Mexican
doo-wop group called Fina Estampa offered to sing a four-part
harmony version of ``My Fiancee.''
   When Miss Ureaneta arrived, tired and minus her lost luggage,
the music began. ``I'm cursing,'' she said good-naturedly. ``I'm
calling the wedding off!''
   Soon afterward they were having their picture taken, kissing.

<HEAD>Comatose Woman Mistakenly Taken To Funeral Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health department officials are trying to
determine if any regulations were violated when an elderly nursing
home patient who was still alive was mistaken for a dead woman and
taken to a funeral home for embalming.
   Attendants at the Sinai Chapels funeral home discovered the
woman, whose name was not released, was still alive.
   ``They took a woman who was virtually comatose,'' said state
Health Department spokesman Peter Slocum.
   Health officials said the incident began Aug. 10 when the
woman's 91-year-old roommate died at the Bridge View Nursing Home
in Queens.
   Someone at the nursing home apparently drew a curtain around the
woman who was still alive, and attendants from the funeral home
assumed she was the dead woman and took her to the funeral home in
a body bag, authorities said.
   The woman was taken to a hospital and later returned to the
nursing home.
   Health officials said they also are trying to determine who was
responsible for the mix-up.

<TEXT>
   Baton-swinging police fired tear
gas and charged demonstrators after 10,000 people took to the
streets on the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion that
crushed the ``Prague Spring.''
   The size of Sunday's spontaneous protest, the biggest against
the invasion since 1969, took foreigners and residents by surprise.
Witnesses saw at least eight people detained around the city,
including Jan Urban, spokesman for the human rights group Charter
77.
   Twenty-eight people were in custody today and authorities
expelled six of seven foreigners detained during the demonstration,
the state news agency CTK said. It gave no other details on the
foreigners.
   The 28 protesters were held ``pending investigation for
suspected hooliganism,'' the agency said. It also reported that two
police officers were slightly injured by bottles thrown from the
crowd Sunday.
   The marchers chanted demands for freedom, the withdrawal of
Soviet troops and support for Alexander Dubcek, the ex-Communist
Party leader who pioneered the reforms of 1968.
   In Moscow, troops charged hundreds of demonstrators and pushed
them out of a central park Sunday when the protesters began
chanting ``Prague, Prague, Prague!'' in memory of the invasion.
   No injuries were reported among about 500 demonstrators and
onlookers, or among the 500 national guard soldiers and police.
   Several dozen people, some shouting ``Fascists!'' at police,
were taken away. Two activists reported separately that 30 of the
protesters were punched and kicked at a nearby militia station
after the demonstration.
   More than 100 of the protesters were detained, said activist
Alexander Podrabinek. Four people were sentenced to 15 days in jail
and 40 others were fined, he said. Most of those detained were
released after interrogation, the CTK agency said.
   About 100 demonstrators held a second rally later Sunday along
Moscow's Arbat shopping mall, but police chased them away and
arrested an unspecified number, said Alexander Chuyev, a member of
the Democratic Union, an unofficial group that wants Soviet troops
out of Eastern Europe.
   The protests marked Aug. 20-21, 1968, when Soviet-led troops led
an invasion of this nation of 15.5 million people.
   In the spring of 1968, the Czech reformists under Dubcek
declared their intent to create a democratic socialist system that
would guarantee free speech and assembly, introduce secret ballot
elections and economic reforms.
   Sunday's police response suggested Czech authorities will not
tolerate renewed protests against the invasion, which Soviet
leaders continue to insist was ``justified.''
   The anniversary march through Prague began after several hundred
people milled around in Wenceslas Square, the site in 1968 and 1969
of bloody protests against the invasion.
   Peace activists collected hundreds of signatures Sunday on a
petition demanding a Soviet troop withdrawal, free elections,
abolition of censorship and the release of political prisoners.
   Police kept careful watch on the crowd and, in the early
evening, protesters began to chant ``Freedom, Freedom!'' and about
10,000 marched toward the Old Town Square, a traditional rallying
point.
   About 8,000 began heading toward the Vltava River, apparently
hoping to cross to Hradcany Castle, the official residence of
President Gustav Husak, who became party leader in 1969 and was
himself replaced in December by Milos Jakes.
   Dubcek, 67, was expelled from the party in 1970 and given a
minor forestry job in Bratislava. Now retired, he said last week
that he planned to spend the invasion anniversary quietly at his
country cottage.
   After police blocked three bridges across the river, the march
dwindled to about 1,000 people. When the smaller crowd tried to
march back to the square, helmeted police moved in with batons,
tear gas, and dogs. They beat at least two people and dragged
others away.
   The state-run news agency CTK issued a brief report on the
protests, saying ``disturbing actions'' were mounted and that ``the
considerate and decisive action of the police prevented riots.''
   Earlier Sunday on Wenceslas Square, 200 people walked behind two
representatives of the Charter 77 movement, Eva Kanturkoa and Tomas
Hradilek, who tried to lay flowers by the statue of King Wenceslas.
   Uniformed police pushed back the two activists and others who
tried to lay flowers in memory of countrymen killed in street
violence after the invasion.
   Three Charter 77 spokesmen were detained Saturday as they walked
to the Soviet embassy to deliver a statement appealing to the
Kremlin to tell the truth about the 1968 invasion. They were later
reported released, but were not seen at Sunday's demonstrations.
   Witnesses also said one person was detained when eight people
tried to lay flowers at Czechoslovak state radio, also the scene of
fierce fighting in 1968.

<HEAD>Records Said To Cast Doubt That He Reached North Pole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British Arctic expert says that Robert Peary,
credited with being the first explorer to reach the North Pole, may
actually have missed the top of the world by 30 to 60 miles, The
New York Times reported today.
   Essential data is missing from Peary's records and Peary's own
behavior after returning from a dash to the pole indicates he may
have known he missed his objective, according to Wally Herbert, a
polar explorer whose conjecture in the September issue of National
Geographic magazine was summarized by the Times.
   Peary's diary and other documents of his 1909 expedition, held
in the National Archives in Washington, were opened to scholars
recently.
   Herbert said his doubts were based on possible navigational
errors, extraordinary distance claims and blank pages or
insufficient data in Peary's diary.
   The diary entry for April 6, 1909, the day Peary is supposed to
have reached the pole, made no mention of it, but a loose page was
inserted that proclaimed, ``The pole at last!!!'' Herbert said.
   He said that after returning to camp, Peary showed no desire to
celebrate and turned away with both hands covering his eyes when
his associate, Matthew Henson, went to shake his hand.
   Peary's account contained no detailed record of wind speed,
weather and ice conditions or systematic position checks from sun
and planet observations, Herbert said.
   In addition to Peary's failing to correct for ice drift and
other possible errors, ``his chronometer _ critical in navigation _
was 10 minutes fast, an error he was not aware of while on the
ice,'' Herbert said.
   ``This alone could have put him west of the pole by 18 miles,''
he said.
   He said no explorers since, even with snowmobiles, have matched
Peary's claimed speed over polar pack. Peary said he made the round
trip from base camp to pole, 296 miles, in eight days, with 198
miles covered in four days.
   Other specialists in polar history expressed little surprise at
Herbert's assertions. The experts also seemed resigned to the
inconclusiveness of the issue.
   ``I'm not sure we are ever going to know if he actually made it
to the Pole,'' said Mary Lynne Bird, executive director of the
American Geographical Society in New York.

<HEAD>Silver Decision Another Slip In Hunts' Fortunes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury's order that the Hunt brothers pay
more than $130 million to a Peruvian company for their scheme to
corner the world silver market marks another setback in the
fortunes of the flamoyant Dallas family.
   However, Saturday's jury decision in New York will have little
effect on the Hunts' efforts to settle a $1.5 billion dispute with
their lenders, a Hunt bankruptcy attorney said.
   Besides the legal judgment, the collapse of silver, sugar and
real estate investments have all contributed to the steady decline
of the family fortune, once estimated at $20 billion.
   The jury said the three Hunt brothers conspired to artificially
raise the price of silver in the late 1970s to the detriment of
Minpeco S.A., the mining marketing company of the Peruvian
government.
   Bunker Hunt, 62, and Herbert Hunt, 59, also were found to have
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity to monopolize the
silver market. The case is a civil action, so no criminal penalties
are attached to the finding.
   Minpeco had said Lamar Hunt, 56, owner of the National Football
League's Kansas City Chiefs, and his two brothers conspired
unsuccessfully with several Middle East businessmen to corner the
silver market.
   But an attorney in the two-year dispute with lenders said the
damages awarded in the silver battle were relatively small.
   ``I feel like the Hunts won,'' Henry Simon, the bankruptcy
attorney representing Placid Oil Co., which is owned by the trust
estate of the Hunt brothers, told the Dallas Times Herald.
   The $130 million damages could be reduced by the $33.4 million
amount Minpeco earned on silver it held during the period, Simon
said. And $64.7 million, which Minpeco received from other
defendants in a pretrial settlement, could also be deducted from
the amount the Hunts must pay, he said.
   The Hunts will file motions that raise other issues in the
silver case, said Tom Whitaker, Hunt Energy Corp. vice president.
   ``The brothers are confident that this wrong result will
eventually be overturned as they proceed through the court
system,'' Whitaker said Saturday.
   At first, the Hunts, sons of the late Texas oilman H.L. Hunt,
took their losses with aplomb. In March 1980, when the silver
market crashed, Bunker Hunt said, ``A billion dollars just ain't
what it used to be.''
   In 1986, the brothers were all on the Fortune 400 list of the
richest Americans with combined estimated assets of $1 billion.
Last year, they dropped off the list.
   This year, when forced to sell his seven Kentucky farms and
600-horse stable of thoroughbred race horses, the eldest Hunt
didn't attend the auction.
   ``It would be too sad to watch,'' he said.
   The Hunts sued their banks and lenders in July 1986, after they
could not renegotiate loans for their Placid Oil Co. and Penrod
Drilling Co.
   The two companies had failed to make payments on a total of $1.5
billion in loans.
   To settle the dispute, the Hunts proposed this spring to pay
$663.5 million from funds raised through Placid operations,
primarily in the North Sea. Hearings on the bankruptcy settlement
proposal were scheduled to begin this month.

<HEAD>Reunion For Former Residents Of Town Lost To Reservoir</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANA, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dana hasn't existed for a half-century,
except in the hearts of its former residents.
   But for five hours Sunday, there was a homecoming for the
survivors and children of the 500 people who once lived in the
town, first settled in 1763 but erased 50 years ago so Boston could
have drinking water.
   Four little central Massachusetts towns died on April 27, 1938,
on order of the state Legislature to form the 38-square-mile
Quabbin Reservoir, after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected their
appeals.
   Three _ Enfield, Prescott and Greenwich _ now lie under 413
billion gallons of water. Only the Dana Common, surrounded by empty
cellars on high ground on the east side of the Swift River valley,
escaped the inundation.
   ``It's the one place left where people can touch what was
formerly there. Everything else is under water,'' said Terry
Campbell, who runs weekly teas for former residents, many now in
the 70s and 80s.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis declared 1988 a Year of Remembrance for
the 2,500 people who lost their homes to the reservoir. Many of
those who moved away have returned this spring and summer to attend
events sponsored by local historical societies.
   ``I was just 10 years old when we had to go. It was hard,'' said
Florence Avery. ``I remember them digging up the bodies in the
cemetery. And my grandfather's house.''
   Mrs. Avery, her five brothers and one of her five sisters, as
well as her 90-year-old mother, Jennie Belle Cooley, visited the
site of their former home beside the deserted Common.
   ``There's still a lot of heavy sentiment that's passed on from
generation to generation,'' said Robert Boutelle, past president of
the Petersham Historical Society and Sunday's master of ceremonies.
``It was like the people who lost their homes were put on a ship
and removed from the United States.''

   Rescuers searched through debris today
for victims of an earthquake that ravaged one-third of this
country's territory and parts of India, killing at least 650 people
and injuring thousands.
   The death toll was expected to climb from Sunday's pre-dawn
quake on the India-Nepal border, which triggered landslides and
floods and was the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 years.
   Officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports
from the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor, which
knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at
least 3,000 people.
   Niranjan Thapa, Nepal's minister of state for home affairs, told
a news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1,000 injured.
He said officials expected the numbers to climb.
   Indian officials reported at least 200 people dead and more than
2,000 injured, most by debris from collapsing buildings.
   The quake, centered almost on the India-Nepal border, registered
6.5 on the Richter scale.
   Indian television today showed the devastation in the Indian
state of Bihar: crumbled buildings, makeshift morgues lined with
rows of bodies wrapped in white shrouds, damaged hospital wards
packed with survivors.
   Medical teams in India carried medicine and other supplies to
overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for
victims.
   But the monsoons, which hit the subcontinent in late June and
usually last through September, hampered relief operations.
   Nepal's Thapa told a news conference that ``the rains have been
a great hindrance in carrying out rescue works. Access to some
areas of this mountain country is impossible.''
   He said 21 of the kingdom's 75 districts suffered extensive
damage. The hardest hit appeared to be Dharan, a sparsely populated
border region where Thapa said at least 131 people died.
   Bir Bahadur Shahi, secretary of the home affairs ministry, flew
to eastern Nepal on Sunday. He said 50,000 to 60,000 houses were
destroyed in the Dharan district alone.
   ``Ninety percent of the remaining houses are cracked,'' Shahi
said, adding that most of the damage was to modern houses of stone
and older houses from mud and bricks. Wooden houses were not
affected, he said.
   Many people were given shelter in schools, guesthouses and
public buildings, ``but most of the people do not want to leave
their homes,'' Shahi said. He said water supplies were still
adequate and there were no reports of disease breaking out.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi flew to Bihar to tour some of the
hardest hit areas. The government said it would release a detailed
report after he returned to the capital tonight.
   Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha of Nepal visited some
of the victims at Bir Hospital in his capital, Katmandu.
   The quake roused people from their sleep in Bihar and nine other
Indian states and central and eastern Nepal. It lasted about a
minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour.
   Rail tracks sank into the soggy ground and bridges over rising
rivers cracked, paralyzing train service and road travel in many
parts of the devastated areas.
   Parts of northern Bangladesh and the capital, Dhaka, also felt
the tremor. There were reports that 50 people were injured, most by
jumping from their houses during the quake.
   Witnesses in Darbhanga, an Indian city of 800,000 about 45 miles
south of the epicenter, said the only warnings were hissing sounds,
rattling doors and cracking windows. Women began blowing conch
shells, following an ancient tradition believed to appease the
weather gods.
   More than 25,000 houses were flattened in Darbhanga, as well as
the districts of Munger and Madhubani, Indian officials said.
   In Madhubani, the Bhootahi Balan River jumped its banks and
flooded nearly 50 villages. Officials said at least 45 people died,
but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or
collapsing houses.
   It was the worst quake to strike the region in 38 years. A
temblor rumbled through the Indian state of Assam on the
India-China border in August 1950. Official accounts said more than
1,500 people died, but seismologists said their records showed
30,000 were killed.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times
greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in
populated areas.

   David M. Newman, 25, of Toledo, Ohio, escaped from the U.S.
Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., on Wednesday by
going over the wall on a ladder he made in the prison workshop.
   He has been serving a life sentence since his May 1984
conviction on murder and other charges in the death of another
soldier at Fort Stewart, Ga.
   Sam Burroughs, an off-duty city police detective, was driving
through Country Club Plaza early today when he saw a man collecting
coins from a fountain, said Lt. Col. John Garlinger, public affairs
officer at nearby Fort Leavenworth.
   Burroughs stopped to question the man, who said he recently was
released from Fort Leavenworth. But a background check revealed
Newman's identity and Burroughs arrested him, Garlinger said.
Newman was returned to Fort Leavenworth.

   A book describing Lyndon B. Johnson as a fearful,
even paranoid president was criticized today by a former Johnson
press secretary as the work of someone who barely knew the former
president.
   Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk, meanwhile, disputed one
incident described in the book.
   In a soon-to-be-published book entitled, ``Remembering America:
A Voice from the Sixties,'' former Johnson speechwriter Richard
Goodwin describes Johnson as intensely fearful of his political
rivals and prone to lapse into irrational ramblings about them.
   ``I am very very uneasy about diagnoses of paranoia, even when
they're made by an expert and Goodwin's not an expert,'' said
former press secretary George Reedy. ``Goodwin really only knew him
for a year or so and didn't really know him too well for that
year.''
   Johnson frequently ``would blow off steam,'' Reedy said, and
White House aides understood that they should ignore some of the
wild directives he would issue during these episodes, Reedy said.
In addition, he said, Johnson was highly manipulative and may have
intended to shock Goodwin, whom he knew to be a friend of Robert F.
Kennedy.
   ``I don't think he has enough background to put it in the right
perspective,'' Reedy said of Goodwin.
   Rusk, in a telephone interview today, said, ``I pay no attention
whatever to talk like that from Richard Goodwin. I consider it
irresponsible and untrue.''
   The book quotes Johnson referring to blacks as ``niggers;''
calling top foreign service officials as ``those damn Kennedy
ambassadors trying to get me and discredit me;'' and accusing
liberals and top newspaper columnists of being communists. Johnson
is also portrayed as obsessed with Robert Kennedy, whom he accused
of plotting against him.
   An advance chapter of the book provided to The Associated Press
focused on Johnson's behavior in 1965, a year when he was at the
height of his political power. Johnson was planning the first
full-scale commitment of American troops to Vietnam while in
Congress he was pushing landmark legislation on poverty and civil
rights.
   In April 1965, Goodwin wrote, Johnson canceled a scheduled visit
by the leaders of Pakistan and India after the two expressed
opposition to the Vietnam War. Goodwin described a heated
conversation between Johnson and Rusk after the U.S. ambassadors to
those countries suggested Johnson send Vice President Hubert
Humphrey to South Asia to ease any hurt feelings.
   ``Johnson read them, then, his face contorted in fury, rose and
slammed them onto his desk. `I don't want telegrams like that,' he
almost shouted, then picked up the phone. `Get me Rusk. ... Listen
Mr. Secretary,' he began, softly sardonic, `You know those
telegrams about Humphrey?'... The president suddenly raised his
voice: `If they send me any more telegrams like that, I want you to
call them back. Fire the bunch of them.'''
   Johnson hung up and said to his aides, ``It's those damn Kennedy
ambassadors trying to get me and discredit me.'' Goodwin said he
was told by a White House correspondent that Johnson had referred
to the snubbed leaders as, ``those two niggers.''
   Rusk said today, ``No such phone call took place and I don't
remember the cancellation of those two visits.''
   Goodwin, although not a trained psychologist, argued that
Johnson exhibited paranoid behavior. The conclusion is based on
Goodwin's observations as well as discussions about Johnson the
author had at the time with a psychiatrist.
   ``Lyndon Johnson had become a very dangerous man,'' wrote
Goodwin, a resident of Concord, Mass. ``There is no question in my
mind that both the atmosphere of the White House and the decisions
taken until 1965 (the only period I personally observed) were
affected by the periodic disruptions of Lyndon Johnson's mind and
spirit.''
   Goodwin was an aide to President John F. Kennedy and later was
the senior speech writer for Johnson. Goodwin left the Johnson
administration in 1965 and later became an opponent of the Vietnam
War.

<HEAD>Thatcher Won't Rule Out Internment</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 12 grafs to UPDATE with Thatcher saying she hasn't
ruled out internment, edit for transition. Picks up 11 graf pvs
``Heath said...''</NOTE>

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today refused to
rule out detention without trial for guerrilla suspects, saying she
wanted to keep the IRA guessing following the killing of eight
British soldiers.
   ``You do not tell your enemies precisely what it is you are
going to do, ever,'' she said. ``We are having a thorough
(security) review of all matters and nothing has been ruled out.''
   Her comments appeared to contradict The Times of London, which
quoted unidentified government sources saying she had rejected
calls by Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland for the internment
of 60 to 80 known Irish Republican Army guerrillas.
   Internment without trial was introduced in Northern Ireland on
Aug. 9, 1971 by the government of Conservative Prime Minister
Edward Heath. Following worldwide criticism, it was abandoned by
the government of Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson in December
1975.
   Speaking to reporters after opening a hospital in the southwest
England port of Plymouth, Mrs. Thatcher branded the IRA bus bombing
an assassination. She vowed, ``We must never let the terrorists
win.''
   Official Unionist lawmaker Ken Maginnes, one of the lawmakers
who wants internment brought back, confirmed today that he gave
Mrs. Thatcher the names of three IRA men he claimed were involved
in Friday night's bombing.
   The attack killed eight and wounded 27 young members of the
First Battalion of the Light Infantry who were just coming off
furlough in mainland Britain. The IRA claimed responsibility
immediately afterward.
   It was the deadliest IRA attack since 1982 and brought the
number of military deaths in a summer blitz to 26.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the Cabinet member
responsible for the province, visited some of the injured and
promised a relentless campaign against ``the men of evil.''
   He said the government and the army would take whatever steps
were necessary to defend ``what is good and what is right in
Northern Ireland.''
   However, the British Broadcasting Corp. said King is convinced
reintroduction of internment would be counter-productive. King met
with security chiefs in Northern Ireland today.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
   Heath said in a BBC radio interview Sunday that his government
quickly realized after the introduction of internment in 1971 that
the policy had been a major mistake.
   He said: ``The people who were interned really bore very little
resemblance to those who were out to cause damage. The way in which
they were arrested ... caused reaction ... throughout the United
States and the rest of the world, which was very damaging to us.
   ``Thirdly, it gave the IRA a means of recruiting from amongst
people who were interned,'' he said.
   Critics of internment said many of the hundreds of people
rounded up were innocent. They also said many of the internees were
brutally treated and that the policy discriminated against Roman
Catholics.
   In 1978, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Britain
had been guilty of inhuman and degrading treatment, in a case
brought by 12 former internees subjected to in-depth interrogation.

   Shooting broke out late tonight
outside a restaurant where a dinner party was being held in honor
of visiting South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-Jung, police
said.
   Kim was not injured in the incident outside the Korean Garden
Restaurant in suburban Makati, police said. They said a civilian
security agent was seriously injured.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, who was attending the party, said
police were investigating. ``Everything is fine,'' he said.
   Others attending the dinner included Rep. Ramon Mitra, speaker
of the House of Representatives, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus,
Sen. Agapito Aquino and Sen. Heherson Alvarez. The party continued
after the shooting.
   There were conflicting versions of how the shooting began. The
DZXL radio station said gunmen fired on security guards who were
standing outside the restaurant.
   But ABS-CBN television said the shooting broke out when guards
tried to stop a plainclothes policeman from entering the restaurant
with a pistol.
   Police refused to confirm either version or to provide further
details.
   Kim arrived Friday at the invitation of President Corazon
Aquino's family.
   On Sunday he attended ceremonies marking the fifth anniversary
of the assassination of Mrs. Aquino's husband, Sen. Benigno Aquino
Jr., who was a personal friend. Kim was to return home Tuesday.

   More than four years after a widow with
no children died and left about $135,000 to the federal government
to reduce the national debt, the money is still in the bank drawing
interest.
   Lawyers for three parties _ the deceased, Minnie Vogel, the
federal government and the Kentucky Revenue Cabinet _ only recently
worked out an agreement to dispose of the estate.
   The agreement capped a lengthy dispute over whether the state is
entitled to claim inheritance tax from Ms. Vogel's estate. Under
the agreement, the state may claim its share _ about $30,000 _ and
the federal government gets the rest.
   The agreement was recently approved by Jefferson Circuit Judge
Edmund P. Karem. Now the parties are awaiting final approval from
Jefferson District Probate Court, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Michael F. Spalding, who is handling the case for the federal
government.
   When Ms. Vogel, of Louisville, died in May 1984 at age 85, she
left about $35,000 and some property to seven nieces and nephews.
The rest, about $135,000, ``I bequeath and devise to my beloved
country, the United States of America, to be used to reduce the
national debt,'' the will stated.
   Efforts to settle the estate hit a snag soon after her death
when the state tried to claim inheritance taxes from the money that
was to go to the federal government. The federal government agreed
to pay the inheritance tax, but Vogel's lawyer sued, saying he did
not think it was Ms. Vogel's intent that part of her money should
go to the state.
   Although the federal government will still receive more than
$100,000 if the compromise is approved, David Liebschutz, a
spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Public Debt, noted that it won't
make a noticeable dent in the public debt, now at $2.5 trillion.

   A wheel flew off a car on a freeway and
crashed through a bus windshield, killing the driver, but two
passengers steered the bus to safety without injuries, authorities
said.
   Bobby Hall, a 52-year-old Southern California Rapid Transit
District driver, was killed in Sunday's accident on the Harbor
Freeway, said Officer Diane Lowery of the California Highway Patrol.
   Hall had been driving southbound about 55 mph when a vehicle
traveling in the opposite direction lost its left front wheel. The
wheel bounced over the highway divider and crashed into the
windshield, Lowery said.
   An unidentified woman, partially blocked by Hall's body,
grappled with the steering wheel while Rancho Palos Verdes
pharmacist William H. Patterson operated the accelerator and brake.
   ``I don't know anything about gears or anything like that,''
Patterson said. ``I was afraid to take my foot off the brake. I was
really just pressing radio buttons asking for help.''
   It took the two a tense three minutes to bring the bus to a halt
after the bus ran into an embankment. None of the 12 passengers
aboard the 40-seat bus was injured.
   The car involved was found abandoned on the freeway. Authorities
were searching for its owner, Lowery said.

   A street-preaching 11-year-old was suspended
minutes after arriving for the first day of school today after he
stuck a Bible in the principal's face and told him ``you go to
hell,'' school officials said.
   ``I have trouble when a child says (that) to an authority
figure,'' said Jim Gorst, principal of Eastfield Elementary School.
   Duffey Strode, 11, had taken only about 10 steps on school
property before he confronted Gorst, said David Strode, the boy's
father, who quoted his son as telling the principal, ``you'll go to
hell.''
   School officials, however, captured the confrontation on
videotape which confirms Gorst's version, said Shirley Ramsey,
Eastfield's assistant principal.
   Strode said he took all three of his preaching children home
after Duffey's suspension, and did not know whether he would take
them to school Tuesday. Last year, Duffey was repeatedly suspended
for shouting Bible verses and preaching against ``whoremongers''
and ``fornicators.''
   The father said today's trouble began when a sheriff's deputy
took the hand of Pepper, 7, who started screaming, and Duffey
``became enraged.''
   Strode and his wife, Robin, have been banned from school
property and watched from beyond the gates.
   Family friends had planned to escort the children from the gate
to the school building, but officials instead ordered the deputies
to take the children. That's when Pepper began screaming, Strode
said.
   Gorst then asked Strode to bring his children into the school.
Strode said he refused and walked away with the three children. At
that point, Gorst asked him to bring the younger children back,
saying only Duffey was suspended, Strode said.
   ``They just don't want Duffey at school, period,'' Strode said.
   Duffey was suspended for 10 days for disruptive and
disrespectful behavior, Ms. Ramsey said. And she warned that a
long-term suspension that could last the entire school year ``can
be enacted at any point.''
   ``School officials have simply said at this point that they will
not have this continue for the year,'' she said.
   Duffey and his brother, Matthew, 6, were preaching on their way
to the school grounds, Strode said. Pepper, who did not preach last
year, yelled ``repent'' a couple of times, he said.
   Earlier, McDowell County Schools Superintendent David Ricketts
said he and other school officials dreaded the first day of school
because last year, the Strode children had preached about
``whoremongers and ``fornicators.''
   ``We cannot go through another year like we did last year,'' he
said.
   Ricketts on Friday notified Mrs. Strode and her husband, David,
in a registered letter that they were barred from the school
grounds; he warned them that ``appropriate action'' would be taken
if they came onto school property.
   The trouble began last spring when Duffey, a fifth-grade A
student, came to school one morning in March and stood near the
back entrance shouting Bible verses.
   When teachers and students passed, Duffey shouted verses about
whoremongers and fornicators. When the principal asked Duffey to
come inside the school, he refused.
   Soon after, kindergartener Matthew did the same thing.
First-grader Pepper accompanied Matthew but did not preach. Mrs.
Strode said Pepper would join her brothers in quoting scriptures
this year.
   Ricketts and Ms. Ramsey say they're concerned about the Strode
children's effect on other children at the school, especially
kindergarten students, who on their first day of school will be
confronted by yelling children and parents.
   They're urging parents to stay calm.
   ``We're hoping the citizens of the county will be understanding
and realize we are doing everything we can as fast as we can,''
Ricketts said.

   Gale-force wind eased as more than 1,000 soldiers flew today to
Yellowstone National Park to relieve some of the weary firefighters
who have spent weeks battling blazes that have charred more than
350,000 acres.
   The first wave of the 1,200 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., was
expected to arrive today to help contain a fire burning out of the
northeastern corner of Yellowstone that is threatening two
communities in southern Montana.
   The first 600 infantrymen from 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry of
the 111th Field Artillery were expected to be on fire lines by
Tuesday or Wednesday.
   Elsewhere, crews mopped up after three fires that totaled about
13,000 acres and had threatened the tribal capital of Lame Deer on
the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana.
But just south of the reservation, the Kirby fire had grown to
10,000 to 12,000 acres and was out of control, Don Kendall of the
Department of State Lands said today.
   And in northern Idaho, hot, dry wind Sunday plagued 200
firefighters in the Nez Perce National Forest, where a 320-acre
fire burned in inaccessible terrain 11 miles north of the Salmon
River.
   In southern Montana, the soldiers will try to stop the
156,000-acre Clover-Mist fire that has burned out of Yellowstone to
within two miles of Cooke City and Silvergate.
   ``They've continued to be able to save structures. Also they're
hoping they can stop the fire from reaching the area,'' said
Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   No evacuations have been ordered, but some residents have left
on their own, she said.
   ``We're realists,'' said Howard Sloan, of Cooke City. ``We've
watched the fire go past containment line after containment line,
and we're scared.''
   ``Winds were calmer and the fires did not progress as
dramatically as they did yesterday,'' Anzelmo said late Sunday.
   At times Saturday, the fires created a spectacular sight.
   ``There were walls of flame that can be anywhere from 100-300
feet high. No humans and no equipment can stop fires when they're
in that stage,'' Anzelmo said.
   Fires that had covered around 280,000 acres of the park Saturday
had spread over at least 350,000 acres by Sunday, or about 16
percent of the park's 2.2 million acres, Anzelmo said.
   Yellowstone's south entrance remained closed indefinitely today,
as was the Grant Village area, which contains a hotel, a
campground, a visitor center and housing for staff. Grant Village
was closed Saturday because of a flareup of the Red-Shoshone fire.
Large sections of highway in the park also were closed, as were
several campgrounds.
   South of Yellowstone, the Rockefeller Memorial Parkway
connecting the park with Grand Teton National Park was closed
because of two fires in the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
Officials evacuated the Teton Science School, several ranches and
two campgrounds.
   In Montana, fire crews battling a 37,200-acre forest fire
southeast of Helena dug fire lines by hand today on the southern
edge of the fire, officials said.
   Fire information officer Bob Krepps said the crews were going
into rugged terrain in the Elkhorn Mountains, in an attempt to
contain the southern edge of the blaze that has burned 10 houses
and cabins.
   In north-central Montana, more than 1,000 firefighters, aided by
heavy rain, contained a 4,500-acre fire on the Rocky Boy's Indian
Reservation on Sunday.
   In southeastern Montana's Rosebud County, two large
lightning-caused timber fires are being fought southeast of Forsyth.
   The 7,000-acre Espy fire remained out of control Sunday night,
primarily burning grass and sagebrush southeast of Forsyth and east
of Colstrip, said Chuck Tonn of the Interagency Dispatch Center in
Billings. No structures were threatened.

   A Hungarian flew over the Austrian border
in a motorized hang glider Monday and asked for political asylum,
authorities said.
   Gabor Loerinczy, showed up at the police station at
Grosspetersdorf, about five miles west of the Hungarian border,
according to police and the Interior Ministry.
   Loerinczy, 36, arrived at the police station on foot and said he
had made an emergency landing in a forest because of engine
trouble, a spokesman for the ministry said. He said he lived in
Gyula, a Hungarian town on the Romanian border.
   He said he had a wife and 11-year-old son in Austria, who had
been waiting for a decision on their appeal for asylum for about a
year, the ministry spokesman said.
   He added it was not known why Loerinczy was seeking asylum.
   Austria and Hungary have abolished visa requirements for their
citizens, and liberalized Hungarian travel laws allow Hungarians to
travel to the West as often as they can afford to, provided they
are granted a passport. Most Hungarians who apply are granted
passports.

   Bus drivers went on strike Monday to
protest a crackdown by traffic police, stranding hundreds of
commuters, the drivers' union said.
   The strike idled about 80 of the state-owned Uganda Transport
Co.'s 150 buses.
   Officials of the bus company and the Ministry of Transport and
Communications, which oversees the company, reportedly were
attending a seminar and were unavailable for comment.
   Vincent Kakande, a senior official of Uganda Transport Co. Trade
Union, said the bus company had refused to assist drivers who had
been cited for driving buses that weren't roadworthy. When drivers
complained about mechanical problems, they have been told by the
company that there are no spare parts, he said.
   The drivers also are upset over the company's failure to pay a
court-ordered fine of about $130 in compensation to relatives of a
man killed in a bus accident.
   ``Instead, we have had to mobilize and raise the money from
among ourselves,'' said one striking driver, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.

<HEAD>Soviets Cutting Back on Awarding Medals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is cutting back on awarding
medals, criticizing the number of honors handed out during the
Brezhnev era and adopting rules to ensure they are given to workers
who deserve them.
   Under the late leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, awards were given out
``by the scores and even by hundreds'' to people who had fulfilled
the government's five-year production plans, the official news
agency Tass said Monday.
   People have stopped appreciating awards because ``they were
given out with a bountiful hand in the Brezhnev period on the
occasion of birthdays and red-letter dates,'' Tass said.
   ``The real contribution of the person awarded was not duly taken
into account,'' Tass said.
   The Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee and
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, has
adopted new rules on medals to make sure they are given to people
who truly deserve them, the news agency said.
   The image of Brezhnev himself is one of a man with a full chest
of medals, and the Soviet press has recently lampooned him for this.
   The overhaul of the award system is another element of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive to hold public officials more
accountable for their work and to end blind praise for them. It
also is another step in moving away from the policies of Brezhnev,
now condemned widely for plaguing the country with cronyism,
corruption and economic stagnation.
   To improve the system, decisions on recipients won't be made by
a small number of high-ranking officials in private, but by all
work collectives and public organizations, the news agency said.
   Awards will no longer be made en masse or for reaching a jubilee
in a citizen's career.
   The country's highest honors, including the title Hero of the
Soviet Union and Hero of Socialist Labor, won't be given more than
once to the same person, as has happened in the past. Eligibility
requirements have been tightened for the top decorations, the Order
of Lenin and Order of the October Revolution, Tass said without
elaborating.
   But while many of the changes appear aimed cutting the number of
awards given, Tass said new honorary titles were being created for
teachers, physicians and agricultural workers. Gorbachev's
administration has placed particular emphasis on improving these
professions.
   The article gave no figures for the number of awards given in
the past or what the number will be under the new rules.

<HEAD>Government Backs Off On Mandatory Eviction Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday
withdrew a widely criticized bill that would force the evictions of
tens of thousands of blacks living in areas designated for whites.
   Critics said the bill, which would require magistrates to evict
anyone living in a neighborhood reserved by law for another race,
would provoke international outrage.
   Chris Heunis, minister of constitutional development and
planning, said the measure would be re-introduced in parliament
with amendments specifying that evictions not be mandatory.
   The amended bill, however, would retain other provisions
strengthening enforcement of residential segregation. Leaders of
the parliament's Asian and mixed-race chambers, which cannot block
most government-backed bills, said their houses would adjourn
indefinitely to protest the new legislation.
   Heunis said the amended bill would allow government officials to
consider the availability of alternative housing and other
``humanitarian considerations'' before approving evictions. In
other ways, he said, it would remain identical to the original
measure.
   Among the controversial measures remaining in the bill are those
making it easier for authorities to confiscate property and to
evict and prosecute people violating the Group Areas Act. The
35-year-old act designates racially segregated neighborhoods.
   Under both the new and old versions of the bill, the maximum
fine for property owners who allow a person to live outside his
racial area would increase from about $165 to $4,100. The maximum
prison sentence would increase from two years to five years.
   The act is a major issue in the campaign for nationwide
municipal elections Oct. 26. The government's proposal to
strengthen enforcement of the act has been seen as an accommodation
to right-wing whites.
   The government has not strictly enforced the Group Areas Act in
recent years, angering conservative whites opposed to integrated
neighborhoods.
   President P.W. Botha said last week he believes residential
segregation is favored by 80 percent of whites, 70 percent of
Asians and people of mixed race, and a majority of blacks.
   Alan Hendrickse, leader of the mixed-race chamber of parliament,
challenged Botha's claim, saying his constituents favored total
repeal of the act.
   South Africa's black majority is excluded from parliament, but
both the mixed-race and Asian chambers are expected to reject the
Group Areas legislation and its amendments.
   This would force the government to refer the bill to the
President's Council, a body controlled by Botha's National Party.
The party has the power to implement legislation over the
opposition of the two non-white chambers.
   Parliament, which reconvened Monday after a midyear recess, also
is to debate legislation on creating the first ``open areas,'' or
legal multiracial neighborhoods. Botha would have veto power over
any such plans.

<HEAD>Indictment Accuses Six Of Running Private Contra Supply Operation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Cuban-Americans are accused of violating the
U.S. Neutrality Act by mounting a private Contra supply operation
out of a clandestine southwest Florida camp, according to an
indictment unsealed today.
   At one point, 60 men were being trained in the camp on the
outskirts of Naples, Fla., with money supplied by two Miami-area
men, Eulalio Francisco Castro and Joseph Marcos, prosecutors said
today.
   Some of the men are accused of shipping weapons to Costa
Rican-based commandoes for use against Nicaragua's Sandinista
government.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Schnapp said other names had come
up in the investigation, and that part of the case had been turned
over to the special prosecutor's office in Washington.
   Schnapp refused to answer any questions that he said were
outside the scope of the indictment, turning away queries about
whether U.S. military or intelligence officials oversaw the
supplying of weapons and mercenaries to fight the Sandinistas.
   The activities detailed today lasted from June 1983 until
September 1986, according to the indictment.
   Four of the six named in the June 28 indictment _ Castro,
Marcos, Rene Corvo and Sergio Becerra _ surrendered today to U.S.
Magistrate Lurana Snow in Fort Lauderdale, Schnapp said.
   Arrangements were being made for the surrender of the other two,
Rafael Torres Jimenez and Francisco Hernandez, he said. All were
expected to be released on bond, as were the defendants in an
associated indictment unsealed in Fort Lauderdale last month.
   The six were named on two counts of violating and conspiring to
violate the Neutrality Act and, if convicted on all charges, face a
maximum of eight years in prison. Corvo was also charged with
firearms violations, and faces up to 38 years if convicted on all
counts.
   The earlier indictment, returned by the same federal grand jury,
accused Mario Calero and ex-mercenary Jack Terrell, among others.
Mario Calero is a brother of Contra director Adolfo Calero.
   The only person to plead guilty in the earlier indictment was
sentenced by U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger of Fort Lauderdale
to one day's probation.

<HEAD>Dates Set For Announcement of Nobel Prizes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nobel Foundation said Monday that
the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize winner will be announced Sept. 29.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
reportedly are among the top contenders for the richest Nobel award
ever.
   The prize for medicine will be awarded Oct. 17, for economy on
Oct. 18 and the prizes for physics and chemistry on Oct. 19, the
Nobel Foundation said.
   By tradition, the date for awarding the literature prize is kept
secret until one week before the announcement.
   Each Nobel laureate will receive about $385,000, which is about
15 percent higher than last year.
   The Peace prize announcement will be made in Oslo, Norway, by
the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian parliament. The others will be
announced in Stockholm by the Swedish Acedemy of Sciences, the
Karolinska Institute of medicine, and by the prestigious 18-member
literary committee known as the Swedish Academy.
   The prizes will be distributed Dec. 10 in Oslo and Stockholm.
   The Norwegian press has reported that Reagan and Gorbachev were
nominated for signing a treaty to dismantle their medium- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   The Nobel committee refuses to confirm the names of the
candidates, whose nominations had to be submitted before Feb. 1.
   A Norwegian member of parliament has said he nominated President
Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, and five Swedish
parliamentarians announced they had proposed a campaigner against
the death penalty in the United States, the Rev. Joseph Ingle of
the Nashville, Tenn.-based Southern Coalition on Jails and Prisons.
   Other possible nominations include Pope John Paul II, jailed
South African black leader Nelson Mandela, Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi and Mordechai Vanunu, an Israeli imprisoned on treason
charges for disclosing details of his country's nuclear capability.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias won the 1987 Peace prize for
drafting a plan to end the fighting in Central America.

   An East Berlin woman who eluded armed guards as
she swam to freedom through a polluted river says she's three
months pregnant, officials reported Monday.
   Four East Germans swam across Berlin's Spree River on Sunday
evening while an East German patrol boat stopped nearby as they
scrambled onto the West Berlin bank near a government building.
   One of the four was Maiga Adryan, who told people she was three
months pregnant, said West Berlin city spokesman Hans Birkenbeuel.
   ``We have no reason to doubt her, even though no medical test
has been conducted here so far,'' Birkenbeuel said.
   Ms. Adryan, 22, broke a foot during the escape, he said.
   The river, filled with industrial wastes, is about 260 feet wide
and under constant East German patrol at the point where the four
swam across it.
   In another incident, police said a young man on a motorcycle
tried to speed through the Checkpoint Charlie border crossing into
West Berlin on Monday, but he rammed a barricade East German guards
had lowered quickly.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Thousands Demand Democracy in Burma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES W. HATTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People filled the streets of Burmese
cities Monday demanding an end to 26 years of military rule, and
soldiers peacefully stopped protest marches in Rangoon, the
capital, diplomats and news reports said.
   The Japanese news agency Kyodo said hundreds of thousands of
people, including children, demonstrated in the northern city of
Mandalay in response to student calls for nationwide protest and a
general strike. Some waved the peacock flag used in the struggle
that led to independence from Britain in 1948.
   Many train and bus operators joined the strike, halting public
transport in Burma's second-largest city 350 miles north of the
capital, Kyodo said. There were sketchy reports of demonstrations
in other parts of the Southeast Asian country.
   Diplomats in Rangoon said about 20,000 people gathered outside
the Rangoon General Hospital, a center of protest, for the largest
demonstration in the capital since the street protests of Aug. 8-12
rioting that forced the resignation of President Sein Lwin, a
former general. Security forces killed more than 100 people that
week.
   No violence was reported Monday. Witnesses said large numbes of
soldiers, the most seen in recent days, manned barricades and
armored cars patrolled the capital. Reports of gunshots could not
be confirmed.
   A Western diplomat said 3,000-4,000 people shouted
anti-government slogans outside the U.S. Embassy, but soldiers and
barricades stopped them from marching down the street.
   Protesters demand that new President Maung Maung, who on Friday
became the country's first civilian leader in 26 years, end the
stern one-party rule of the Burma Socialist Program Party and the
economic hardship it has created.
   Burmese authorities ``want to avoid violence, but at the same
time they're determined that things don't get out of control,'' a
Western diplomat said. He added that students have called for daily
demonstrations.
   Diplomats said most people went to work despite the strike and
most shops in Rangoon were open.
   Kyodo said demonstrators students, Buddhist monks, public
servants and professionals were among demonstrators at the
hospital. It said they held banners and shouted slogans, including
``Down with one-party dictatorship!'' and ``Now more than ever
democracy!''
   Some attempted a one-mile march to the Sule Pagoda, where huge
rallies were held Aug. 8-12, but up to 15 truckloads of soldiers
were parked in front of it.
   ``When about half of those taking part in the rally set out to
march, they were blocked by soldiers,'' an Asian diplomat said.
   ``We've heard that the soldiers sent marchers running away but
there have been no reports of any injuries or deaths. From what I
observed, those taking part in the rally were generally ...
peaceful and the soldiers also seemed to be holding back.''
   At Victoria Point, at the Thai border in the south, about 10,000
people marched to the town hall Monday shouting anti-government
slogans, a Thai police official said.
   Victoria Point, 490 miles southeast of Rangoon, is a market ton
on the frontier between Megui province and Thailand's Ranong
province. Security forces there turned against the government
during the protests of Aug. 8-12 and gave protesters free rein,
Thai officials said.
   A man claiming to speak for a coalition of 16 university student
unions called news agencies in Bangkok and said the alliance was
seeking help from Burmese rebel groups in Bangkok. He claimed it
has about 50,000 members.
   Rebels hold large areas of Burma bordering Thailand. Brang Seng,
a leader of the National Democratic Front of 10 guerrilla armies,
declared last week it would join the protesting students.
   The Karen National Union, one of the strongest rebel groups,
issued a statement Monday in Bangkok declaring support for the
students and calling on foreign governments to halt aid to burma
until one-party rule ends.
   Maung Maung, the Western-educated attorney general, became
Burma's first civilian leader since Ne Win seized power in a 1962
military coup. Ne Win resigned in July and ally Sein Win replaced
him.
   Burma has been in turmoil since September 1987, when the
government voided 60 percent of the currency in circulation without
compensation. University students rioted to protest the resulting
hardship in a nation whose per capita annual income of less $200 is
among the world's lowest.
   More riots, increasingly focused on political demands, occurred
in March and June. Protesters accuse Sein Lwin of personally
ordering ruthless suppression of the demonstrations.
   Rioting resumed after Sein Lwin became president and party chief
July 27, and soldiers fired into crowds. The government has said
112 people were killed and 267 wounded in Rangoon alone, but
diplomats said they believed the toll was higher.

<HEAD>Although It Closed in 1974, Olivero Cafe Is Open for Reminiscing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GREEN VALLEY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been 14 years since the kitchen
closed at the Olivero Cafe, but Minnie Olivero still entertains
friends there and tidies up the counter she toiled behind for more
than 40 years.
   Although you can't buy a meal at the diner, or pay 10 cents for
a slice of homemade pie, the Olivero Cafe remains open to old
friends and to strangers curious about times past.
   ``This place is a museum and I am too,'' laughed Mrs. Olivero,
who will be 82 on Tuesday. ``I guess I'm an antique, like most of
the things in here.''
   The tiny cafe is a classic 1930s-era diner and soda fountain
that seated about 25 people at its five tables and stools.
   For 40 years, five months and three days, Minnie served
sandwiches, coffee, her special chili, homemade pie and ice cream
to hungry truk drivers, coal miners, motorists, farmers and
residents of this town of 800 located about 30 miles south of
Peoria.
   The cafe was open seven days a week, often 12 hours a day, and
every holiday through the Great Depression, World War II and the
post-war boom.
   ``Louis always used to say we'd close when the last nickel goes
by the window,'' she said. ``It was a part of our lives and we both
enjoyed it. It's not because we were more dedicated than anyone
else or a different cut of people.''
   Minnie dropped out of school in sixth grade to work in her
parents general store in Panama, Ill., in 1919. She married Louis,
a coal miner, in 1924.
   The couple was flat broke three times early in their marriage,
Mrs. Olivero said. In 1933, Louis borrowed $100 from his wife's
family to buy a cafe on old Route 29 in Green Valley.
   ``When Louis told me he bought the cafe, I told him to go run it
by himself because I didn't like to cook,'' she said.
   But cook she did, earning a reputation for her homemade
chocolate syrup and soda fountain syrups. She also cleaned,
collected telephone bill payments, sold tobacco, candy, greeting
cards, bus tickets and blew the community fire whistle every
evening.
   ``The old hard road was the main drag between Springfield and
Peoria,'' she said. ``We had a lot of coal-truck drivers and they
hauled straw from all around here up to Quaker Oats in Peoria. We
had a good business.''
   In 1937, the Oliveros moved their cafe to a new building on the
corner where Main Street intersected the highway. They lived behind
the cafe and Minnie cooked in the family kitchen.
   Their only child, Oliver, ran the candy counter and helped out
at the cafe until he left to fight in World War II as a pilot. In
1945, he was killed over the Adriatic Sea and his body was never
found.
   ``After that, Louis quit working at the coal mine and we both
worked at the cafe,'' Mrs. Olivero said. ``The only reason we
worked that hard was to build a nest egg for our son.''
   For the first time, they closed the cafe to take vacation trips
each summer. The rest of the year, however, they remained open
every day, Christmas included.
   ``I enjoyed it and Louis did too,'' she said. ``I think now how
crazy we must have been. But it was our life.''
   It still is Minnie's life. Her husband died shortly after they
closed in 1974 and she has kept the cafe as a private museum ever
since.
   Shiny milk-shake glasses and various size Coke glasses stand on
the wall behind the soda fountain. Minnie still uses the antique
cash register to hold her spare change, and the ice box and
refrigerator hold her groceries.
   There are plates on the walls, and hundreds of photos of
relatives and friends in the cabinets that once held pies, tobacco,
costume jewelry and other goods. She still blows the fire whistle
every night.
   ``We had so many fond memories here, that's why I'm glad I
stayed,'' she said.

   A tentative, undisclosed settlement was
reached today in a lawsuit filed by the widow of astronaut Michael
J. Smith, the pilot of the space shuttle Challenger, against the
manufacturer of a faulty booster rocket.
   ``We've resolved the matter subject to working out some
details,'' said William Maready, an attorney for Jane Smith.
   John Adler, a lawyer representing rocket manufacturer Morton
Thiokol Inc. said both sides would request that details of the
settlement not be disclosed.
   Mrs. Smith initially filed a wrongful death suit against Morton
Thiokol in federal court in Florida, but the case was transferred
to Virginia because of a backlog of cases in the Florida court.
   Smith, a Navy pilot, was one of seven crew members killed when
Challenger exploded after it was launched on Jan. 28, 1986. A
hearing on summary judgment motions was set for today before U.S.
District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., but Merhige called the
attorneys into chambers and after two hours the tentative
settlement was announced.
   Maready and Adler said a statement would be released Tuesday,
but terms of any payment to Mrs. Smith would not be disclosed.
   The case was the last of the Challenger-Morton Thiokol suits to
be settled. Terms of the company's payments to the other families
also were not disclosed.
   Morton Thiokol manufactured the solid-fuel booster rocket blamed
for the explosion that destroyed the shuttle.

<TEXT>
   George Bush emotionally defended embattled
running mate Dan Quayle today, telling a veterans organization
Quayle joined a National Guard unit with vacancies and never went
to Vietnam because his unit was not called there.
   ``It's true, he didn't go to Vietnam because he wasn't called,''
Bush told the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. ``But here's
another truth: He didn't go to Canada and he didn't burn his draft
card.''
   Veterans in the audience gave Bush a hearty ovation after the
vice president, departing from his prepared text, said he believes
Quayle has been the vicim of ``shrill, partisian attacks.''
   ``Let his attackers cast the first stone,'' Bush said.
   ``Because I served in combat and because I saw some of my
countrymen killed, I salute the Vietnam veterans today, those who
fought in the rice paddies,'' he continued.
   ``I hardly ever walk by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in
Washington when I don't get a lump in my throat or a tear in my
eye. But many others served, too, some in the Army Reserve, some in
the National Guard _ people who were not sent overseas.''
   Meanwhile, Quayle reasserted today that he broke no rules nor
did anything unfair to get into the Indiana National Guard during
the Vietnam War.
   Appearing on two television talk shows, Quayle also said he did
not think it was hypocritical for him to strongly back the war
effort and opt to join the Guard at the same time.
   And he said he is convinced the furor will die down and can't
wait for that to happen.
   ``Right now, I just sit there and answer questions,'' Quayle
said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Asked about ``the question of hypocrisy,'' Quayle said:
   ``I don't think it's hypocritical. There were a lot of people
that were in the National Guard in my National Guard unit that
supported the goals of fighting communism in Vietnam, but were in
the National Guard.''
   On NBC's ``Today'' show, Quayle said, ``I don't even know what
my (draft lottery) number was'' at the time he joined the Guard.
   Quayle joined the Guard in the summer of 1969. The lottery
system of selecting people for the draft took effect Dec. 1 that
year.
   Quayle posed for photographers in his Senate office later in the
day, but brushed aside questions about his continuing status on the
Republican ticket, saying only: ``I'm George Bush's running mate.''
   As reporters attempted to pepper him with more questions, Quayle
said: ``I was a journalist one time. I used to tell people, `Don't
ever get into an argument with people who buy ink by the barrel.''
   Then, looking at the television cameras surrounding him, he
said, ``I'm not going to, even with cameras.''
   Bush had said earlier he is confident Quayle will surmount the
flap over his National Guard duty, but that in the meantime, ``I've
got to take the heat.''
   Bush said Sunday that he remains upbeat about his election
prospects despite questions about the extent to which family
influence helped Quayle avoid being drafted and got him into law
school even though he didn't meet admission requirements.
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis is responding to the
controversy by noting that the qualifications of his own vice
presidential choice, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, have not come under
attack. Otherwise, Dukakis has kept to his own campaign themes and
today was visiting northeastern Massachusetts, a region he often
cites when discussing his record of economic development.
   Bush had a speech scheduled to a Veterans of Foreign Wars
convention in Chicago.
   Bush was clearly unhappy Sunday with the intense scrutiny of
Quayle's background and with Democratic criticism of his own
decision-making. He said he's sticking with Quayle, with ``no
hesitancy,'' but that the Indiana senator needs time ``to get his
act together'' before campaigning on his own.
   Bush, who conducted joint appearances with Quayle in the Midwest
over the weekend, said Quayle will begin campaigning alone ``as
soon as he can get squared away'' with a staff and a schedule of
appearances.
   Quayle stumbled during initial news conferences and interviews
after being selected by Bush last week, and Bush aides are spending
the early portion of this week trying to prepare him for his first
solo campaign appearances, scheduled to begin Wednesday.
   Throughout their appearances in Indiana and Ohio, questions
continued to be raised about the circumstances of Quayle's
enlistment in the Guard at the height of the Vietnam War in 1969.
He was 22 then, and described himself at the time as a supporter of
the war.
   Quayle has said that before his student deferment from the draft
expired, he discussed with his family his desire to join the Guard.
A former top newspaper employee of the family said he interceded
with the Guard on Quayle's behalf.
   Questions also are being raised about Quayle's law school
admission. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Sunday that Quayle
did not meet the academic requirements of Indiana University law
school but got in anyway after meeting with the admissions dean, a
Republican judge in a city where Quayle's family owned the local
newspaper.
   The Plain Dealer quoted Quayle's father, James C. Quayle, as
saying his son met with the dean after being initially rejected by
the law school. ``He talked his way in,'' the elder Quayle said.
   Bush dismissed questions about the law school admission by
saying, ``I don't see that there's an enormous demand from the
public to learn this guy's high school grades.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., appearing on NBC-TV's
``Meet The Press,'' said Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III
had told him that he believed the military issue was ``pretty much
behind them.'' But Dole said his own opinion is that ``it's going
to last awhile.''
   Dukakis said over the weekend that people should notice how few
have questioned the qualifications of Bentsen to serve as vice
president. Other Democrats were quick to challenge Bush's
decision-making ability.
   ``Why did George Bush pick Daniel Quayle? That's got to be the
question,'' House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said on
CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' program. ``His first presidential
decision was Dan Quayle. Michael Dukakis' first presidential
decision was Lloyd Bentsen.''
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich, also on CBS, said that
if Quayle is not qualified to be vice president, ``at that point,
the real issue is not Dan Quayle. It's George Bush and his
judgment.''
   Bush, speaking with reporters on Air Force Two, said no thought
had been given to asking Quayle to withdraw, that the 41-year-old
senator had not offered to step aside, ``and he shouldn't.''
   ``I want him out campaigning,'' Bush said. ``He will have a
tremendous appeal to young people, and he'll help with that gender
gap.
   ``He's been thrown into a hornet's nest, but you know, I've been
there,'' the vice president said. ``I've got to take the heat. I
made the decision. The buck stops right here. I have no hesitancy
about it.''

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews June 22-July 2 with 1,223 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult
who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results,
19 times out of 20.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may exceed
100:
   1. Do you think the Olympic Games should be held at one
permanent site or should they continue to be held at a different
location every four years?
   One site: 11 percent. Different: 85 percent. Don't know-no

   The United States has informed the Soviet
Union and India that American support for Pakistan's security
remains strong in the wake of the death of President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq.
   Separate messages were sent to both Moscow and New Delhi after
Zia's 11 years of rule ended in an air crash Wednesday in which
U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel and Brig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom,
chief of the U.S. military group in Pakistan, also perished.
   ``The point is we wanted to reassure them that our policy is
unchanged, and that we are going to stand by Pakistan,'' said a
U.S. official who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity.
   The tone of the messages and conversations here and in Moscow
with Soviet diplomats was more pointed than in dealing with India,
said a second U.S. official. ``With the Soviets it was more in
terms of cautioning them about Afghanistan,'' said this official,
who also spoke anonymously.
   ``So far, the behavior is quite correct in each case,'' a third
U.S. official said.
   Pakistan under Zia was the closest U.S. ally in central Asia and
the conduit for the shipment of American and Chinese weapons to
Afghan rebels fighting a guerrilla war against the Afghan
government and Soviet troops.
   While the State Department has complimented caretaker President
Ghoulam Ishaq Khan about the steps he took after Zia's death,
including a decision to go ahead with national elections in
November, there is concern there could be prolonged instability in
Pakistan.
   So far, U.S. officials said, there is no indication that the
Soviets are slowing the pace of their troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan or seizing on the death of Zia to raise tensions in the
area.
   ``Their hostility to Pakistan has not ended,'' a U.S. official
told The Associated Press. ``They haven't backed off. But there is
no escalation. I think they understand very clearly our position.''
   India, which has gone to war several times with Pakistan since
the 1940s, has strong military ties with the Soviet Union.
   A funeral service for Raphel was held Monday at the Fort Myer
chapel in Arlington, Va. The speakers included Deputy Secretary of
State John C. Whitehead and veteran diplomat Philip C. Habib.

<TEXT>
   A third round of talks between delegates
from North and South Korea about peace and sharing the Olympics
broke down Monday with no word on when the two rivals would meet
again.
   The 10 legislators _ five from each side _ ended the talks that
began Friday at this village inside the Demilitarized Zone, 35
miles north of the South Korean capital of Seoul, without
indicating there would be another meeting before the Olympics.
   One top South Korean official said the talks probably would be
suspended until after the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics in Seoul.
   The two Koreas, bitter neighbors since their land was divided at
the end of World War II, refused to budge from their past positions
and instead blamed each other for blocking progress.
   The meeting at a North Korean pavilion in the northern sector of
this truce site ended after two hours when both sides said the
talks were deadlocked. South Korean chief delegate Park Joon-kyu
proposed a private meeting with his communist counterpart to try to
resolve the problem.
   North Korea's delegation withdrew to consider the proposal but
did not respond by the set deadline, and the South Korean
delegation returned to Seoul.
   Park said he asked for the private meeting to see if North Korea
was sincere about making headway.
   ``If there is no hope, we will postpone the next meeting until
after the Olympics,'' Park said.
   Chon Kum Chol, the chief North Korean delegate, said after the
meeting that South Korea's ``attitude is anti-unification. Their
direction and way of thinking is mistaken.''
   Chon held out hope for another meeting but said, ``It all
depends on the southern side. It is the South that should make
concessions.''
   South Korea called for urgent talks to be held in the North
Korean capital of Pyongyang beginning Aug. 29 to focus solely on
trying to resolve the issue of the Olympics.
   ``I must say the Olympic issue is an urgent and important
question and both sides agree that the question should be resolved
before the end of August,'' Park said.
   But Chon, in an opening statement before South Korean made its
proposal, said separate talks on the Olympics were unacceptable. He
said North Korea wanted joint discussion of the Olympics and the
non-aggression issue.
   North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the South
Korean offer on the Olympics was contrary to the purpose of the
talks.
   ``The publication of a joint declaration on non-aggression and
the 24th Olympic Games are important problems that should be solved
together at an early date as they are aimed to remove the
confrontation and tension, misunderstanding and distrust between
the North and the South,'' the news agency said in a report
monitored in Tokyo.
   Still at issue was a North Korean call for a joint meeting of
nearly 1,000 members of the two sides' legislatures to discuss its
bid to be a co-host of the Olympics and draft a joint declaration
on non-aggression.
   North Korea also said Monday a formal non-aggression treaty was
not necessary because, it contends, the two sides are not separate
nations. It called for both sides' parliaments to issue a
declaration of non-aggression, which seeks a pullout of 42,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea.
   North Korea says it will boycott the Olympics if it is not
allowed to be a co-host. South Korea fears North Korea could use
terrorism to disrupt the Olympics.
   Previous, sporadic talks between the two sides since the early
1970s failed to make progress. The last talks collapsed in January
1986 when North Korea pulled out to protest annual South
Korean-U.S. military exercises.
   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by Soviet and U.S.
forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War
II. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War,
which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty being
signed.

   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker fell to his
knees when he and his wife, Tammy, asked for the forgiveness of
charismatic Christians gathered for the Southeastern Congress on
the Holy Spirit.
   ``I say let the reconciliation begin,'' the Rev. Karl Coke,
pastor of Garr Memorial Church in Charlotte, told the 2,000
participants at a service Sunday at Owens Auditorium.
   ``I don't consider this risky,'' Coke told the Bakkers. ``I
threw my reputation away when I walked into this room and sat with
you.''
   Bakker grabbed Coke in a long embrace, then fell to his knees
onstage. Worshipers pressed forward with cameras to encircle the
Pentecostal preacher who built and lost the PTL ministry and its
Heritage USA theme park in a sex and money scandal.
   ``Body of Christ, have you sinned against Jim Bakker?'' Coke
asked the audience.
   ``Yes,'' hundreds shouted back.
   ``Has Jim Bakker sinned against you?'' Coke continued.
   ``Yes,'' the crowd replied.
   ``Do you forgive him?''
   The ``yes'' was drowned out by applause.
   Coke put the next questions to Bakker.
   ``Have you sinned against the body of Christ?'' he asked.
   ``Yes,'' Bakker said.
   ``Will you ask them to forgive you?''
   ``Yes,'' Bakker replied tearfully.
   ``Seventeen years ago, I came to this auditorium for the first
time,'' Bakker said. ``The first time I ever ministered in this
city was in this room. People rallied and built a network that went
around the world.
   ``I love you, and I have sinned, and I ask you to forgive me.''
   Bakker said he had spent the past year reading the Bible. He
said he confessed his sins ``from childhood to this minute'' to a
Catholic priest he described as a former alcoholic.
   The Southeastern Congress on the Holy Spirit, which met Thursday
through Saturday at Heritage USA outside Charlotte at nearby Fort
Mill, S.C., was a follow-up to a national meeting that drew 35,000
charismatics to New Orleans last summer.
   Organizers said Sunday they had raised $40,000 of the $50,000
needed to pay expenses and plan the next event.

<HEAD>Vice President Declares Intention To Lead Opposition Against
Aquino</HEAD>

   Vice President Salvador Laurel on
Monday declared his intention to lead the opposition against
President Corazon Aquino after she rejected his call to resign.
   Laurel made his remarks during a news conference in which he
likened Mrs. Aquino to deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. Laurel
objected to a statement Mrs. Aquino made Sunday in which she
claimed to have a ``contract with God'' to lead the country until
her term expires in 1992.
   Mrs. Aquino, meanwhile, asked the country's provincial governors
to block any coup attempts against her when she visits Brunei next
week for a three-day state visit.
   Laurel said Mrs. Aquino's rejection of his demand to resign and
call new elections, which he issued Aug. 13, gave him no choice but
to lead the opposition.
   ``Therefore, as vice president, I will devote my time to voicing
out the grievances of our suffering people and lead all those who
believe that this nation is entitled to a better government,''
Laurel said.
   ``Mrs. Aquino has chosen to ignore and evade the issues of
incompetence, corruption and lack of leadership that have
characterized her administration,'' he charged. ``Once again she
regaled the people with promises which for the past 30 months she
has consistently disregarded.''
   Laurel called for new elections after accusing the Aquino
government of incompetence. He said that if she resigned, he would
also resign. If not, he said he would remain vice president but
``dissociate'' himself from her government.
   In a speech Sunday, Mrs. Aquino accused unspecified ``enemies of
the state'' of trying to destabilize her government. She said she
was determined to remain in office and produce economic progress.
   ``Nothing and no one shall deflect me from this task,'' she
said. ``For my mandate is with this nation, not with its enemies.
My covenant is with the constitution, our contract is with God.''
   Marcos had made a similar statement to justify his 20-year rule
of the Philippines, Laurel said without elaborating.
   Mrs. Aquino met Monday with 45 provincial governors, during
which she discussed efforts to curb corruption, fight poverty and
crush the 19-year communist insurgency. She also called on the
governors to continue supporting her government during her visit to
Brunei, which begins next Monday.
   ``I know that while I am away, you will take care of things, so
that my enemies will not try to pull something again,'' she said.
Mrs. Aquino's government has survived at least five coup attempts
in the last two years.
   Executive Secretary Catalino Macaraig said Monday the government
was stable enough to allow Marcos to return but would rather he
stay away if it had its way. He said the government was leaving the
question of Marcos' return to the courts.
   ``I think the president is confident that the government can
cope with whatever events might be triggered by the return of
President Marcos,'' Macaraig said.
   But he warned that opponents of Marcos might try to kill him if
he returns.
   ``The military will have to give him protection,'' he said.
``There is really a problem because there are those who might try
to do him harm and put the blame on the president.''
   The possibility of a Marcos return from his Hawaiian exile
surfaced last week when the anti-graft court ruled the ousted
president had the right to be present during the court deposition
of a former Cabinet minister set for November.
   Philippines officials accuse Marcos of stealing billions of
dollars from the treasury during his presidency.

   An American delegation led by novelist
Susan Sontag plans to dramatize the imprisonment of four South
Korean literary figures to try to obtain their release.
   The 52nd International P.E.N. Congress, which will bring
together about 700 writers from Aug. 29 to Sept.2 in Seoul, plans
to introduce a resolution calling on South Korea's government to
release the four, a spokeswoman said Monday.
   P.E.N. identified those in prison as publisher Lee Tae-bok,
writer Kim Hyon-jang and poets Lee San-ha and Kim Nam-ju. Publisher
Kim Sang-bok was released from prison Aug. 15 as part of a general
amnesty program.
   The South Korean P.E.N. Center, which also has pressed for
release of the four, scheduled meetings this week with Justice
Minister Chong Hae-chang and sent letters to President Roh Tae-woo.
   ``The congress is a good chance to draw atention to this matter
worldwide,'' said H.B. Lee, a professor at Seoul National
University and a P.E.N. member. ``We hope this will be the right
setting at the right time to press for release.''
   Karen Kennerly, executive director of the American P.E.N. Center
in New York City, said Monday that while ``we recognize the great
strides toward democratization in South Korea, we find it
disturbing that four writers and publishers remain in jail.
   ``We had hoped to come to Seoul to celebrate their release and
hoped and expected them to join us, and other colleagues, at the
meetings,'' Ms. Kennerly said.
   She said Ms. Sontag plan to make an appeal to South Korea's
government for release of the four at a reception Aug. 30. The
delegations of Canada, Australia, Denmark, Sweden and the
Netherlands are to be co-hosts for the reception.
   Ms. Sontag, a novelist and essayist, is president of the
American chapter of P.E.N. and was one of four human rights
activists who sent South Korean President Roh Tae-woo a letter July
22 protesting the imprisonments.
   ``The April 1 sentencing of poet Lee San-ha to 1{ years in
prison for writing a poem is alarming evidence that the practice of
censorship _ in its most reprehensible form _ still exists,'' the
letter said.
   ``We note, too, that scores of books are subject to confiscation
because of their political content and that films and plays are
subject to censorship,'' the letter said.
   The letter claimed that licensing controls on foreign
publications ``severely limit the free flow of information ...
limit not only the right of Korean citizens to receive information,
but that of the participants in the P.E.N. Congress.''
   In addition to Ms. Sontag, those who signed the the letter
included Roland Algrant, chairman of the International Freedom to
Publish Committee, Sophie C. Silberberg, executive director of the
Fund for Free Expression and Jack Greenberg, chairman of Asia Watch
in Washington D.C.

   Could it be that the Rolling Stones can't get no
satisfaction from playing apart? Former Stones vocalist Mick Jagger
says the splintered band is planning a reunion.
   ``We are talking about (a reunion) for 1989,'' Jagger told a
reporter Monday at Heathrow Airport en route to Australia from his
home in New York.
   Jagger refused to give details, but when asked what the
essential element of such a reunion would be, he answered,
``Pleasure.''
   The Rolling Stones' last album was ``Dirty Work'' in 1985. The
band's ``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' was named the best single
recording from 1963-1988 by Rolling Stone magazine last week.

singing and acting ``is like a coin _ heads is `Miami Vice' and

   ``I was doing music long before I got into acting,'' said
Thomas, best known as the dapper detective Tubbs on the NBC series.
   Thomas visited the Warner Bros.@Elektra@Atlantic Records office

will handle distribution of his second album, ``Somebody.''
   ``Somebody'' features several songs written by Thomas and was
recorded with help from singers Nickolas Ashford, Valerie Simpson
and Maria Muldaur.
   Thomas, 42, was accompanied by his younger brother George, who
serves as his bodyguard.
   ``I can handle myself if there are any negative vibes,'' said

want to stay forever signing autographs and things, and there are

a lot of memories to remember.''
   ``And a lot of things to forget,'' the birthday boy interjected.
   The band then launched into a string of songs that have earned
the Statlers more awards than any other country group, including
``Hello, Mary Lou,'' and ``Bed Of Roses.''

   ``It's kind of weird seeing someone
else playing my life,'' says teen-age AIDS victim Ryan White, whose
struggle to attend public school is being made into a television
movie here.
   But Ryan, 16, is more than a bystander on the movie set. He has
been given a small role as an older hemophiliac who, like Ryan,
contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion.
   ``He's a natural,'' said Linda Otto, co-executive producer of
``The Ryan White Story,'' an ABC movie starring George C. Scott
which is being filmed in Statesville through Sept. 9.
   To Ryan, his small role reinforces the film's message that AIDS
cannot be transmitted through casual contact. ``It tells the story,
plus it helps educate people about AIDS and the hardships people go
through,'' he said in an interview Friday.
   The role of Ryan is being played by Lucas Haas, who starred
opposite Harrison Ford in ``Witness.''

   Stage and screen legend Helen Hayes
has been hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat after falling ill
while visiting her son, actor James MacArthur.
   Doctors were trying to determine whether Miss Hayes, 87, had
suffered a heart attack or only altitude sickness. She was listed
in good condition Monday at St. Mary's Hospital.
   ``She is very tired and really apprehensive about the media
learning about her being here,'' Karen Bennett, a nursing
supervisor, said Sunday night.
   MacArthur's home is in Crested Butte, which has an elevation of
nearly 10,000 feet.
   ``I really feel it was just the altitude that was bothering
her,'' said Dr. Dan Tullius of Crested Butte. ``But she was sent to
Grand Junction to confirm whether or not she had a heart attack.
... She had an irregular heart beat and it could be secondary to
altitude.''
   The silver-haired actress has won a Tony, two Oscars and an
Emmy, and in 1981 received the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime
achievement.

   Ann-Margret plans to return to the Las

where she began her stage career as a teen-ager.
   She will perform Nov. 9-21 at Caesars Palace to start an
exclusive two-year pact which also includes performances at Caesars
World hotels in Atlantic City and Lake Tahoe, Nev.
   Ann-Margret was one of the hottest attractions in Las Vegas
until she quit to spend more time with her husband, actor Roger
Smith, and to pursue other career interests.
   During the last six years, Ann-Margret has received critical
acclaim and three Emmy nominations for ``Who Will Love My
Children,'' ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' and ``The Two Mrs.
Grenvilles.''
   She recently co-starred with Alan Alda in ``A New Life.''
   The Swedish beauty burst upon the Las Vegas scene in 1960 when
comic George Burns selected her as an opening act for his show. In
the years that followed, she became one of Las Vegas' most popular
singers and dancers.

boy in a park attacked the driver, his wife and children,
authorities said.
   Lorgio Cano, 59, who was charged with second-degree
manslaughter, driving while intoxicated, driving without a license
and driving in an unauthorized area, was reported in satisfactory
condition Monday at a hospital where he was being treated for
severe head trauma.
   Sgt. John Venetucci said the incident occurred shortly after a
soccer match Sunday night in Van Cortlandt Park in the borough of
the Bronx.
   Venetucci said Cano; his wife, Blanca; and their five children,
ages 4 to 14, got into the family van which was illegally parked on
the edge of the playing field.
   He started driving across the field when he apparently lost
control and struck a baby carriage being pushed by Louisa Martinez,
21, Venetucci said. Mrs. Martinez's 4-month-old son, Justo, was
killed.
   A crowd ran to the van and yanked Cano and his family from the
vehicle.
   ``They were hitting all of them with rocks and sticks _ even the
children,'' said Emergency Medical Service specialist Michael Mohn.
``When we tried to get to them to treat them (the Canos) the crowd
started screaming at us. They wanted to keep us away from them.''
   Mohn said he and his partner, John Ortiz, had to fight their way
through the crowd and fight their way back to the ambulance with
the injured Cano.
   The rest of the Cano family and two others believed to have been
involved in the fight were treated for minor injuries. Mrs.
Martinez suffered a minor leg injury and was also treated and
released.

   Drawing on royal precedent, the Duke and Duchess
of York have named their 2-week-old daughter Beatrice Elizabeth
Mary, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   The princess' names are from Queen Victoria's youngest child,
the present queen and her mother, and the duke's great-grandmother,
Queen Mary.
   The baby, who is at the royal summer retreat in Scotland with
her parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah, and the queen, will be known
as Her Royal Highness The Princess Beatrice of York.
   She is fifth in line to the throne and the first child for the
Duke and Duchess of York.
   The announcement of her name ended energetic speculation, which
long preceded her Aug. 8 birth. One major bookmaker closed his
books for a time when a newspaper quoted Andrew as saying one day
in May that the baby would be a girl named Annabel.
   But Annabel continued to remain a favorite among bettors, along
with Charlotte and Victoria. Not a single bet was placed on
Beatrice at two of the country's largest bookmakers, they said with
delight.
   ``It's terrific. We couldn't have chosen a better name,'' said
Graham Sharp of William Hill bookmakers, which offered Beatrice at
100 to 1 odds. ``We cleaned up every which way.''
   ``It is a bit of a surprise for everybody,'' said Malcolm Palmer
of Coral Bookmakers. ``Victoria and Elizabeth were the two
favorites.''
   The only correct entry in the public guessing game came from
Britain's largest-circulation newspaper, the tabloid Sun, which
reported all three names Friday.
   The newspaper said Annabel had been the first choice of Andrew
and Sarah, but the queen, who must approve royal names, rejected it
as too ``yuppie,'' and suggested Beatrice.
   The last Princess Beatrice among British royals was the youngest
of Queen Victoria's nine children.
   The Sun reported the name was royal enough for the queen but
unusual enough to please Sarah.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publisher of Burke's Peerage, said Sarah
was pleased because she likes old-fashioned names.
   The baby's second name honors her grandmother, the queen, and
her great-grandmother, Queen Mother Elizabeth. Her third name,
Mary, is the name of the duke's great-grandmother Queen Mary, wife
of King George V, as well as the middle name of Sarah's mother,
Susan Barrantes.
   Buckingham Palace said no date had been announced for the
christening.
   Prince Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, is due to return soon to
his ship, HMS Edinburgh, in the Far East following a leave of
absence.

   An Ohio horse-breeder who has never laid
eyes on Tougaloo University donates a sum to the school every time
his mare of the same name wins a race.
   ``No I've never been to the school,'' said Landon Knight, of
Akron. ``But it just sounds like such a great institution. If they
can get people into the mainstream from such underprivileged
conditions, that's a great accomplishment.''
   Every time Tougaloo, a 5-year-old mare, crosses the wire first,
Knight, 64, donates 10 percent of the purse to the predominately
black private college in this tiny central Mississippi town. He
estimates he has donated $30,000 the past three years.
   Tougaloo is to run again Saturday at Thistledown in Cleveland
and at River Downs in Cincinnati on Sept. 3. She has won three
races in Ohio this year, raising $9,000 for Tougaloo.
   Knight said he decided to name the horse after the college after
receiving promotional literature from the 750-student school.
   ``The name was so attractive,'' Knight added. ``And what they
had to say about the school was even more attractive. I guess I
could have just named the horse Tougaloo, but I contacted the
school and asked them if I could use their name. In return I told
them I would given them 10 percent.''
   Tougaloo President Adib Shakir was on hand June 18 in Cleveland
when the mare took the $60,000 purse at a race at Thistledown.
   ``A college benefiting from a race horse is a very unique
situation,'' said Shakir. ``This is my first time going to the
horse races and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I can't
begin to say how appreciative we are of the generosity shown by Mr.
Knight.''
   The school ought to update its mailing list, though.
   ``I received this literature addressed to C.L. Knight,'' Knight
said. ``Well, he was my grandfather, but he died in the 1930s.''

   Ship painter Kenneth Samuels doesn't
think there's anything fishy about being wed on a shrimp boat, so
he persuaded his bride to say ``I do'' where most people say
``ahoy.''
   Samuels, 27, and Jackie Van Nort, 41, exchanged vows Friday
night on the Shirley T, a 40-foot-long white and blue shrimp boat
in the Ocean Springs Harbor.
   The boat's white deck had been carefully swabbed and the green
shrimping nets hung gracefully draped overhead. The bride wore a
satin dress, but otherwise the shrimp boat decor held through.
   ``I love shrimping. I guess that's why I came up with this,''
said Samuels, now a painter at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula
but who put himself through school by working on shrimp boats since
he was 13.
   ``We met when he was working on a shrimp boat,'' said Van Nort.
``It wasn't my idea, but I wanted him to have it his way.''

<HEAD>Afghanistan Blamed For High Terror Rate in Pakistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A terrorist campaign in Pakistan carried out
by agents of Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government accounted for
well over half of all incidents of state-sponsored terrorism
worldwide last year, according to a State Department report
released Monday.
   Out of 189 such cases, Afghanistan carried out 127 against
Pakistan in its campaign of retaliation for Pakistan's backing of
Afghanistan's anti-communist guerrilla movement, the report said.
   The report was prepared before last Wednesday's incident in
which a mysterious plane crash killed Pakistani President Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel, Brig. Gen. Herbert
Wassom and 27 others.
   Pakistani officials suspect sabotage but investigators lack
conclusive evidence as to the cause of the crash, which occurred
330 miles south of Islamabad.
   State Department officials, insisting on anonymity, said any
comment on the cause of the crash would be speculative but added
that Afghan agents have to be ``among the suspects'' because of
their alleged role in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan.
   Diplomats at the Afghan Embassy here were unavailable for
comment.
   Paul Kriesburg, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said it would be a mistake to assume
automatically that Afghan agents were responsible for the crash
because Zia had many other enemies. They included some from within
the Pakistani military and others who were alienated by his
authoritarian rule.
   The State Department compilation indicated that Afghan-sponsored
terrorist acts almost tripled those of Iran, listed second with 44.
Libya was third with 7 terrorist episodes.
   All told, there were 832 international terrorist incidents last
year, according to the study.
   ``When the Pakistani numbers are subtracted, the number of
incidents in the rest of the world declined by almost 10 per cent
from 1986 statistics,'' the report said.
   It said the Pakistan campaign is being waged by the Afghan
Ministry of State Security, known by the acronym WAD.
   Zia said last November that the assassinations and bombings
carried out against Pakistani civilians were ``at the behest of the
Soviet Union'' but Moscow has denied the allegation.
   U.S. and Pakistani officials estimate that bombs planted by
Afghan agents have killed more than 400 civilians in Pakistan. The
bloodiest incident occurred in July 1987 when three car bombs
exploded in the main bazaar of Karachi, killing 72 and injuring 260.
   The report said it is likely that the Soviets have been aware of
Afghan operations in Pakistan because of the close ties between WAD
and the Soviet intelligence agency, KGB.
   It said that while some of the material for the explosive
devices can be purchased on the black market, other items can be
obtained only through Soviet sources.
   Pakistan estimates that about 1,500 Soviet advisers work with
WAD.

<HEAD>Families of Slain Hostages File Criminal Charges against Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREMEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families of two teen-agers slain
during last week's two-day bank robbery and hostage drama have
filed charges of criminal negligence against police, lawyers said
Monday.
   A week after the series of shootings and chases, the story
continued to dominate West German news media. A debate on the
incident was scheduled for Wednesday by the local government in
Bremen, where gunmen Dieter Degowski and Hans-Juergen Roesner
hijacked a city bus during the tense standoff.
   Lawyers Bernd Rosenkranz and Gerold Bischoff said they filed
charges on behalf of the families of hostages Emanuele di Giorgi,
15, and Silke Bischoff, 18. Silke was Gerold Bischoff's niece.
   ``The charge is that of negligently causing death due to failure
to give assistance,'' Rosenkranz said.
   Under West German law, prosecutors must investigate the charges
to decide whether a trial is warranted.
   Rosenkranz said the di Giorgi family alleges further that police
provoked the gunmen by detaining a female accomplice during the
incident, which began Aug. 16 with a bank robbery and
hostage-taking in the town of Gladbeck.
   Degowski, 31, shot the Italian youth after police temporarily
seized accomplice Marion Irma Loeblich at the Grundbergsee rest
stop on the superhighway near Bremen. The boy died after trying to
protect his 9-year-old sister from the bandits, according to
witnesses.
   The charge also says that police missed several opportunities to
end the hostage drama, according to Rosenkranz.
   After that shooting, Degowski, Ms. Loeblich and Roesner forced
the bus to drive to the Netherlands early Thursday. There they
freed most of their two dozen hostages and then drove back to West
Germany with the two remaining hostages.
   On Thursday afternoon, police ended the drama during a pitched
battle on a busy highway near Bonn. Police captured both gunmen and
Ms. Loeblich, 34.
   Ms. Bischoff was killed in what authorities said was a shot
fired by either Degowski or Roesner, 32.
   Her uncle said he had filed charges of criminal negligence
against police in Bremen and in the state of North-Rhine Westfalia.
   It escalated into the bus hijacking in Bremen 135 miles to the
northeast of Gladbeck after police met the gunmen's demands for a
getaway car.

<TEXT>
   The widow of the space shuttle Challenger's
pilot has reached a tentative and undisclosed settlement of a
wrongful death suit against the manufacturer of the faulty rocket
booster.
   Details of the agreement were not disclosed by attorneys for
Morton Thiokol Inc. and Jane J. Smith, whose husband, Navy Capt.
Michael J. Smith, was one of seven people killed when the
Challenger blew up on Jan. 28, 1986.
   ``We've resolved the matter subject to working out some
details,'' William F. Maready, who represented Mrs. Smith, said
Monday.
   John Adler, an attorney for Morton Thiokol, said the parties
would request that the settlement amount remain confidential.
   Mrs. Smith, of Virginia Beach, initially sought $1.5 billion in
damages from the federal government and Morton Thiokol when the
suit was filed last year in federal court in Orlando, Fla. Damages
were not specified when the case was transferred to Virginia
earlier this year.
   The families of the other six Challenger victims have accepted
undisclosed financial settlements from the company, which built the
solid-fuel booster rocket blamed for the explosion.
   Four victims' families also received settlements from the
government. U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett of Orlando
rejected Mrs. Smith's claim against the government, because her
husband was on military duty assigned to the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. had appointed former
U.S. Sen. William B. Spong of Virginia as a special ``settlement
master'' to seek a compromise. Spong said Merhige pushed hard for
an agreement before trial.

<TEXT>
   George Bush charged Monday that Michael Dukakis
favors ``unilateral cuts in our defense'' and said the
Massachusetts Democrat does not understand the
``peace-through-strength'' theme that has guided Reagan
administration national security policy.
   Bush, in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention,
chided Dukakis for saying that he reflects President Reagan's views
on the Soviet Union more closely than the vice president.
   He also made an impassioned defense of embattled presidential
campaign running mate Dan Quayle, saying the Indiana senator has
``been under shrill partisan attack'' over allegations that Quayle,
a hawk on defense issues, used family connections to sign up with
an Indiana National Guard unit at the height of the Vietnam War.
   ``I salute the Vietnam Veterans here today, those who fought in
the rice paddies,'' Bush said. ``But others served too, some in the
Army Reserve and some in the National Guard, and were not sent
overseas.''
   ``True, he didn't go to Vietnam but his unit wasn't sent,'' the
vice president said. ``But there's another truth: he did not go to
Canada, he did not burn his draft card and he damned sure didn't
burn the American flag. I'm proud to have him at my side.''
   In an address frequently interrupted by applause by the war
veterans, many of them wearing their garrison caps, Bush accused
Dukakis of having advocated policies in the past which would have
weakened America's hand in dealing with the Kremlin.
   Bush said a president must be committed to keeping U.S. forces
modernized, saying only modernization and testing of weapons gives
the Soviets ``the incentive to negotiate real arms control
agreements.''
   He said that ``I plan to negotiate strategic arms reductions
with the Soviets. ... But I will not do what my opponent has
suggested _ get rid of the MX, the Midgetman, the B-1 bomber and
two carrier battle groups. I will not make such unilateral cuts in
our defense.''
   ``As veterans, you know better than anyone else the terrible
cost of war,'' the Republican presidential candidate said. ``I,
too, almost lost my life in one.''
   ``I think it is fair to ask this morning whether my opponent
understands this fundamental truth: that strength deters
aggression. That the way to peace is through strength.''
   ``Peace through strength works,'' Bush said.
   The Bush campaign considered the vice president's foreign policy
speech the major Bush event of the day. Bush was traveling to
Spokane, Wash., for a Republican rally there.
   He used much of the Palmer House speech here to criticize
Dukakis' statements on national defense policy, particularly the
governor's recent suggestion that Reagan seeks to warm relations
with Moscow while Bush argues a harder line to placate
conservatives.
   ``My opponent would have you believe that he's closer to Ronald
Reagan on defense policy than I am,'' Bush said. ``Well, he's about
as close to Ronald Reagan on defense as Winnie the Pooh is to
Refrigerator Perry in the area of bears.'' Bush was referring in
the latter instance to William Perry, the more than 330-pound
offensive lineman for the Chicago Bears football team.
   Bush said that Dukakis long supported a nuclear freeze, but said
the governor has stepped away from that position since the Reagan
administration consummated the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
(INF) treaty with the Soviet Union, eliminating a whole class of
nuclear missiles.
   If the United States had embraced the nuclear freeze movement,
Bush said, ``it would have locked in Soviet superiority in a range
of strategic areas.''
   ``It would have prevented us from deploying the Pershing
missiles in Europe,'' he said. ``How else would we have convinced
the Soviets that we were serious about having them remove their
thousand SS-20 warheads at a time when we had none.''
   ``In the microwave oven of the campaign, my opponent's position
on the freeze has started to melt, in belated recognition of the
fact that our policies are working,'' he said.
   Bush also chided Dukakis for opposing the participation by
Massachusetts in construction of an emergency communications system
for use by a president in the event of an attack.
   ``Only one governor refused to have a (Ground Wave Emergency
Network) site in his state _ the governor of Massachusetts,'' he
said.
   Bush said that he is pleased to see reform coming about in the
Soviet Union, but said the United States must not let down its
guard in dealing with the Kremlin.
   ``Andrei Gromyko was right. He's (Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev) got a nice smile. He's also got iron teeth. And one
major reason why he favors agreements now is because we're strong.''
   ``We're not out of the woods yet,'' he said. ``The Soviets are
now deploying two new ICBMs, the SS-24 and SS-25. So even with
perestroika, Soviet military modernization, including their own
research into strategic defense, has not slackened.''

<TEXT>
   Farmers leaving for 10 days of
harvesting free hay in Idaho boarded buses in a downpour Monday,
providing hope that their own drought-ravaged pastures might be
green by the time they get home.
   ``But it will still take several weeks for that forage to grow
back up, assuming we get enough rain, and even then you wonder what
kind of growth there will be,'' said Dale Johnson, manager of the
Farm Bureau Spokesman, a publication of the Iowa Farm Bureau.
   ``The drought has killed off part of it, and then if you have a
frost the first part of October, that will curb things a little
bit, too,'' he said.
   About 60 farmers boarded two chartered buses for the trip,
hoping to harvest a train load of hay from reserve acreage.
   ``A lot of these guys really need the hay, so they made a quick
decision to come. Some people hired people to go in their place,''
Johnson said.
   The venture is a cooperative effort of the Farm Bureau in Idaho
and Iowa, with Greyhound donating the buses, Burlington Northern
railroad donating freight space for the baled hay and three banks
in Chariton, south of Des Moines, putting up cash for meals along
the way. Murdock said he expects other banks will also chip in.
   In spite of the donated services, organizer Don Murdock said he
initially had trouble recruiting a crew for the excursion because
the drought has made it even more difficult for farmers to leave
home for extended periods.
   Murdock, a regional manager of the Farm Bureau's office in
Chariton, said many farmers were reluctant to commit a week to 10
days because the drought makes it necessary for them to haul water
and feed to cattle.
   But when word spread, he said, the first bus filled up quickly
and the second bus was filled nearly as fast.
   In addition, he said, about 15 more farmers will leave for Idaho
later this week.
   Murdock said the Idaho Farm Bureau offered unlimited hay to
drought-stricken farmers if they would supply the labor for the
harvest. The hay will come from private fields ordinarily idled
under the federal government's Conservation Reserve Program but
freed because of the drought.
   Murdock said he was told that 200 tons of hay already has been
shipped to North Dakota and that he hoped Iowans could fill a
freight train.
   ``I don't know how much we can harvest, but if we've got 75 guys
out there on modern machinery haying all day, that's a lot of
hay,'' said Johnson.
   Murdock said first priority for the hay will go to those making
the trip.
   Those next in line will be farmers needing hay but unable for
physical or other reasons to go to Idaho, including an elderly
couple that Murdock said were feeding their cattle by cutting down
trees so the animals can eat the foliage.
   ``The lady is about 70 and said she can run machinery and wanted
to go while her husband, about 75, stayed behind,'' Murdock said.
``I wouldn't let her go but I'm going to make darn sure they get
some hay.''

   A bomb blew up a car in east
Belfast on Monday afternoon, killing one person, police said.
   It was not immediately known whether the victim was a civilian
or a member of the security forces in the British province, a
spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   The device went off in heavy traffic during rush hour, but first
reports indicated the person in the car was the only casualty, the
spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity, in keeping with
British practice.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.
   On Friday, an Irish Republican Army bomb killed eight British
soldiers in Northern Ireland. The outlawed IRA has targeted
security forces in its fight to drive the British out of the
province and unite it with the Irish Republic.

Success</HEAD>

   Safety features in the redesigned space
shuttle booster rocket appear to have performed as designed during
a crucial test-firing despite deliberately incorporated flaws, a
spokesman said Monday.
   The test was the fifth and final full-scale firing needed to
qualify the solid-fuel booster for flight.
   Engineers from Morton Thiokol Inc. and NASA have torn down the
aft skirting and nozzle section of the 126-foot-long rocket that
was fired last Thursday at Morton Thiokol's plant 25 miles west of
Brigham City, said company spokesman Rocky Raab.
   ``Everything continues to look very, very good,'' Raab said of
the weekend examinations. ``No problems whatever were uncovered
.... From what they've seen so far, it looks like the best nozzle
yet.''
   If the positive evaluation of the rocket holds, NASA officials
have said they expect to set a firm launch date in late September
or early October for the first shuttle flight since Challenger
exploded on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Engineers also examined the test booster's nozzle section,
looking for any indications of unexpected failure in features
designed to contain super-hot exhayst gases, Raab said.
   A NASA-designed nozzle component failed during the second of
five qualifying firings last December. Subsequent test-firings
incorporated a Morton Thiokol nozzle design that had been
successfully used in the first full-scale test in August 1987 _ and
has performed well since.
   NASA grounded the shuttle program after the Challenger disaster
in which seven astronauts died. A presidential commission blamed
the disaster on a faulty booster seal between segments of one
booster which allowed exhaust to escape sideways and ignite the
spacecraft's external liquid fuel tank.
   Raab said detailed inspection and analysis of the tested rocket
will continue through the rest of the month, with engineers
removing another of the booster's four segments about every two
days.
   ``We should be able to remove the aft segment about Thursday,
allowing them to look at the most-flawed field joint. There will be
extensive documentation and testing done when they break that
joint,'' Raab said.
   ``They should finish up about two weeks after the firing,'' he
said, adding that final NASA clearance for the booster's use should
come shortly after that.
   Last week's $20 million test-firing was the climax of Morton
Thiokol's 2{-year, $470 million effort to redesign the solid-fuel
rocket.
   For the test-firing, two of the three joints, the case-to-nozzle
joint and the igniter-to-case joint were riddled with 14
intentional flaws. Morton Thiokol officials said the flaws were
intended to test the new booster's safety features to their limits.
   The third joint was left unflawed in order to serve as a
comparison, Raab said.
   Among the defects were separations in bonded adhesive insulation
that helps hold the joints together, and channels cut to allow
gases to reach the joint's middle O-ring _ one of three gaskets

   Health officials are trying to track
down the source of a strep throat epidemic that has stricken about
400 inmates and 13 employees at the county jail.
   Nassau County Health Department officials began collecting air
samples and taking nose and throat cultures of kitchen workers at
the East Meadow facility.
   The entire jail population, including almost 1,500 inmates and
800 staff personnel, was put on antibiotics in an attempt to stem
the outbreak.
   ``Everyone, even me, is on pills,'' said Sheriff Joseph
Jablonsky. ``It's been very disruptive, to say the least.''
   Jablonsky canceled all court appearances by inmates until
Tuesday. He also canceled jail visits and outside volunteer work.

   A suspect in a four-year string of attacks
attributed to the ``handcuff rapist'' faces charges in as many as
60 rapes, police say.
   Robert Biddings, 34, of Columbus, was arrested Friday and was
being held in the Franklin County jail on a single rape count.
   Police spokeswoman Denise Pangborn said Biddings is a suspect in
a series of attacks dating to 1984 and attributed a person
nicknamed because he used handcuffs in early attacks.
   Ms. Pangborn said evidence against Biddings would be presented
to a Franklin County grand jury, accompanied by requests for
indictments on 60 counts of rape and more than 100 other
miscellaneous felony counts.
   Police Capt. Antone Lanata said Biddings was arrested as a
result of an attempted rape Aug. 11. The victim gave police a
partial license number of her attacker's car, and police used it to
arrest Biddings.
   Lanata said Biddings had so far been been linked to 19
additional attacks.
   ``The victims have picked him out of a photo display, or by
physical evidence _ fingerprints,'' Lanata said. Interviews with
victims were continuing, he said.

   The Dan Quayle dilemma, revolving generally
around questions of inexperience and privilege, has ensnarled
George Bush at a critical moment and threatens the Republican
candidate's appeal to the ``Reagan Democrats'' who helped make him
what he is today.
   The emerging image of Quayle as an overindulged rich kid is not
so much Quayle's problem as Bush's: the issues reflect as much on
Bush's judgment in 1988 as Quayle's judgment as a 22-year-old in
1969.
   While decrying the ``shrill partisan attacks'' against Quayle,
Bush apparently can't answer the Quayle questions himself. Last
Friday he was asked by Time magazine if the media was overreacting
to the Quayle questions, and said:
   ``Yes. Damn right. But I don't know what the facts are. I have
to wait and see what facts are driving this.''
   Bush would rather be talking about his ``L-word,'' the brand of
Democratic liberalism he associates with George McGovern, Jimmy
Carter, Ted Kennedy and now Michael Dukakis. But the Quayle matter
makes that practically impossible; in political terms, Bush has
lost control of the agenda.
   ``I wish all this weren't churning around out there,'' Bush told
Time. ``It's distracting attention from the campaign itself.''
   Republican activists across the country have been supportive of
Quayle, while the Washington GOP establishment is openly wary.
   Karen Stram, chairwoman of the Maine Republican Party, calls the
Quayle controversy ``peripheral,'' and says voters deserve to hear
a clear dialogue between Bush and Dukakis. She complained that TV
coverage of Bush's big night in New Orleans last Thursday could be
summed up: ``He gave a good speech. And the latest on the Quayle
story is ...''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, asked if Quayle should be
taken off the ticket, said Monday, ``If there was something
additional that came up that was a distraction or a
disqualification, well, the option's always there. But I don't see
it at this juncture.''
   Was Bush's choice of Quayle a mistake? ``I'm not going to call
it a mistake yet,'' he said, adding, ``Once you've committed
yourself to a role, you pretty much have to see it through.''
   A similar not-too-ringing endorsement came Sunday from Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole, the World War II combat hero who
apparently ran second in Bush's vice presidential deliberations. He
embraced the ticket again, but said, ``Right now I'd guess there
are a number of Reagan Democrats who are going to remain undecided
or maybe go the other way (to Dukakis).
   ``I mean, they're out there in my little hometown,'' he said of
these crossover voters who put Reagan and Bush in office, ``And I
must tell you, in my generation you knew who was in the Guard and
who was in uniform fighting for their country. So they're very
sensitive about it _ they didn't have anybody they could call ...
Well, my father wore overalls, who's he going to influence?''
   Most recent surveys indicate Dukakis leads Bush among the
Reagan-Democrats already; the scent of special privilege can't help
among the overall and blue-collar voters that Dole refers to.
   Today, the questions of Quayle privilege amount to this:
   Did Quayle use unusual family influence to get into the National
Guard, thereby ducking the draft and an almost certain ticket to
Vietnam? Did Quayle trade on family influence to get into Indiana
University Law School after being a ``proverbial C+ student,'' as
an undergraduate.
   ``There's been nothing that has been substantiated that any
rules were violated, that we did anything that was unfair,'' Quayle
said Monday in response to questions about his entry to law school
and the guard.
   On another matter, Quayle was asked last week what executive
experience had prepared him to become vice president, and cited,
among other things, his work in the attorney general's office while
attending law school at night.
   Now questions are being raised as to how the young Quayle landed
this job. Quayle's father says an influential family employee got
Quayle an interview with the attorney general.
   These matters caught off-guard a presidential campaign that is
bragging about its competence and had since March 8 to evaluate the
many Republicans who might add to the Bush ticket. Did Quayle
mislead the Bush interviewers? Did Bush and his people ask the
right questions?
   However voters eventually decide to judge the Quayle candidacy,
answering these questions is not the way George Bush hoped to take
advantage of the momentum he earned Thursday night in New Orleans.
Conservative columnists Evans and Novak described the Quayle
questions as a ``skunk at the picnic.''

<HEAD>Preaching Strode Child Suspended On First Day Of School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARION, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A street-preaching 11-year-old was told to
go home on the first day of school Monday after reportedly telling
his principal to ``go to hell.''
   ``I have trouble when a child says (that) to an authority
figure,'' Jim Gorst, principal of Eastfield Elementary School, said
Monday.
   David Strode, said his son, Duffey, had told Gorst ``you'll go
to hell.'' School officials said the boy's message was a more blunt
``you go to hell.''
   After Duffey was suspended for 10 days, Strode took all three of
his children home, and said he did not know whehter they would try
to go to school on Tuesday.
   Before classes opened, school officials said they would not
permit classes to be disrupted as they were last year when Duffey
staked out a back entrance of the school and yelled out Bible
verses condemning ``whoremongers'' and ``fornicators.''
   The boy yelled at the principal after a sheriff's deputy tried
to escort the children onto the grounds of the school, said Strode.
   When a deputy took the hand of Pepper, 7, she screamd and Duffey
``became enraged,'' said the father, who watched the proceedings
from outside the school gates.
   ``They (school officials) wanted to provoke those children and
they did,'' Strode said.
   Shirley Ramsey, the assistant principal, said the school had
videotaped the incident, as it has done in previous instances of
Duffey's preaching. She said the recording indicated the boy told
Gorst, ``you go to hell.''
   ``The issue here is God and the devil,'' Strode said. ``The gods
of the public school system are Horace Mann and John Dewey. Their
religion is this _ humanism, evolution, integration. That's why
they don't want the kids promoting the King James Bible around the
school anywhere.''
   Duffey was suspended for disruptive and disrespectful behavior,
Ms. Ramsey said. She said a year-long suspension ``can be enacted
at any point.''
   ``School officials have simply said at this point that they will
not have this continue for the year,'' Ms. Ramsey said.
   Strode and his wife, Robin, were notified Friday they had been
banned from school property.
   The Weavers, family friends, were to escort the children from
the gate to the school building, but officials instead ordered the
deputies to take the children.
   After the confrontation between the boy and the principal, Gorst
asked Strode to bring his children into school. Strode said he
refused and walked off with the three children.
   At that point, Gorst asked him to bring the younger children
back, saying only Duffey was suspended, Strode said.
   ``They just don't want Duffey at school, period,'' he said.
``Pepper, she's scared to death now.''
   Duffey and Matthew were preaching on their way to the school
grounds, Strode said. Pepper, who did not preach last year, yelled
``repent'' a couple of times, Strode said. All three had book bags
on their backs and Bibles in their hands, he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Law On Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan Monday signed
legislation increasing significantly the liability of nuclear power
companies for compensation of the public in the event of an
accident.
   The bill extends for 15 years a law passed in the 1970s designed
to provide such protection.
   The new law, like the old one, requires private insurance of
$150 million per reactor. It increases from $5 million to $63
million per reactor the second-tier insurance, provided by the
federal government.
   Altogether, the amount of compensation available in the event of
a nuclear accident would be increased to over $7 billion.
   The act that is being extended also ``makes feasible commercial
nuclear power generation,'' the president said.
   ``I sign this legisaltion in the midst of a summeer that has
brought record temperatures to much of our country,'' the president
said. ``As a consequence, many of our utilities find themselves
near the limits of their power-generating capacity.''
   ``The implication of this situation is clear: Our nation must
move forward into a new era of safe, economical and clean nuclear
power,'' he added.

<HEAD>Fisherman Snares Dynamite; Police Think It Was Stolen Last Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVINGTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fisherman reeling in his hook found
sticks of dynamite instead of a fish, and that led to a search in
which police believe they have recovered dynamite stolen last month
at gunpoint.
   The July 19 theft of 100 pounds of dynamite, along with 200
blasting caps, caused concern, in part, because it took place
during the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   But on Saturday, a man fishing in the Yellow River reeled in a
surprise.
   Newton County Sheriff's Detective Lt. Ezell Brown said Danny
Duffey of Jackson called officers in nearby Butts County and
reported that he had snagged two sticks of dynamite.
   Butts County deputies contacted Newton County deputies, who went
to the scene that night but found no more dynamite. On Sunday, fire
officials from both counties went to the river and eight divers
found more dynamite, Brown said.
   Newton County police think it was the dynamite stolen July 19
from a worker for a Douglasville explosives company who was robbed
by an armed man wearing a ski mask.
   ``We feel that we've done a total recovery of what was stolen
from Henry County,'' Brown said, but he would not disclose how much
dynamite was found.

<HEAD>Records Said to Cast Doubt That Peary Reached North Pole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New knowledge of Arctic weather, currents and
ice drift and analysis of Robert Peary's documents indicate the
explorer hailed as the first person to reach the North Pole may
have missed the mark by 30 to 60 miles, a British Arctic expert
says.
   Navigational errors, gaps in Peary's expedition diary, his own
sullen behavior on his return and his extraordinary distance
claims, which have never been duplicated even on snowmobile, cast
doubts on Peary's feat.
   The Peary controversy was reopened by Wally Herbert in the
September issue of National Geographic magazine and summarized
Monday by The New York Times, which had bought exclusive rights to
Peary's original story.
   The newspaper's money helped pay for the expedition. But it was
the National Geographic Society, then an elite scientific group
whose journal grew into one of the world's most popular magazines,
that certified Peary's achievement and dismissed the rival claim of
Dr. Frederick A. Cook, who said he reached the pole a year earlier.
   Cook had sold his story to the Times' rival, The New York Herald
Tribune. But his journals were lost in transit from the Arctic to
his home.
   Peary's diary and other documents of his 1909 expedition, held
in the National Archives in Washington, were opened to scholars
recently by the Peary family.
   Herbert noted that the diary entry for April 6, 1909, the day
Peary is supposed to have reached the pole, made no mention of it,
but a loose page was inserted that proclaimed, ``The pole at
last!!!''
   According to the account of Peary's aide de camp, Matthew
Henson, Peary showed no desire to celebrate on his return to the
base camp after their five-day sprint to the pole with four
Eskimos. Henson said Peary turned away with both hands covering his
eyes when Henson went to shake his hand.
   Henson, who was the first black polar explorer, may actually
have reached the pole first, if either of them did, since he
scouted in front of Peary. Henson published his journal in 1912 and
it caused a falling out with Peary, who had wanted only his
observations to be published.
   Peary's diary contained no detailed record of wind speed,
weather and ice conditions during the crucial 30 hours when he
reportedly made his sprint to the Pole. Neither did it record the
systematic sextant readings necessary to determine one's position
relative to the sun, Herbert said.
   Herbert also noted that ``his chronometer _ critical in
navigation _ was 10 minutes fast, an error he was not aware of
while on the ice ... This alone could have put him west of the pole
by 18 miles.''
   No explorer since Peary has matched his claimed speed over the
polar ice pack. Peary said he made the 296-mile round trip by
dogsled from base camp to pole in eight days, with 198 miles
covered in four days.

<TEXT>
   The White House declined comment
Monday on the controversy surrounding Republican vice presidential
nominee Dan Quayle, saying only that Quayle ``is the vice
presidential candidate and he's a good one.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he had no comment
on the prediction of Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., that the issue of
Quayle's enlistment in the National Guard during the Vietnam War
``is going to last awhile.''
   Asked whether President Reagan believed Quayle should be dropped
from the ticket, Fitzwater replied, ``It is not a relevant question.
   ``Senator Quayle is the vice presidential candidate and he's a
good one,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said Reagan has not talked with Vice President George
Bush since making a brief telephone call to him after his
acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in New
Orleans last Thursday.
   He said the two would have a chance to confer, perhaps for half
an hour or an hour, prior to a joint appearance in Los Angeles on
Wednesday. He did not speculate on what they would talk about.
   Fitzwater said Reagan's principal role in the fall campaign will
be to ``draw distinctions between liberals and conservatives,
between Democrats and Republicans.''
   He said four or five appearances had already been scheduled and
somewhere between eight and 15 are expected. He said the president
would go to the South, the Northeast, the West and ``all around the
country.''
   The president and his wife, Nancy, will leave Tuesday for Los
Angeles and return to their ranch north of here on Saturday,
staying until Sept. 6, when they return to Washington.
   On his way to Los Angeles, the president will stop at Long
Beach, Calif., to sign a bill designed to reduce U.S. deficits in
world trade.
   Asked whether it was politically embarrassing to the president
that the prime sponsor of the bill was Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the
Democratic vice presidential nominee, Fitzwater said it was not.
   ``Senator Bentsen did a good job with this,'' Fitzwater said.
``He has worked on it a lot of years, and so have we.''

<HEAD>Sasson Jeans Creator Surrenders, Ordered Held Without Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The creator of the bankrupt Sasson jeans empire
surrendered Monday and was ordered held without bail for violating
an agreement that had freed him while he awaited trial for
allegedly threatening the life of a judge.
   Paul Guez, who gave himself up to federal marshals, had
disappeared last week while free on $100,000 bond, then appeared
without his lawyers before the judge he is accused of threatening.
   Guez appeared before U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey, who
rejected the defendant's argument that he misunderstood the
arrangement that allowed him to come to New York from California
last week to attend to bankruptcy proceedings.
   ``I find your account of how confused you were unconvincing,''
Mukasey said. The restrictions were ``reasonable and perfectly
obvious. They would have been obvious to a child.''
   Mukasey had revoked Guez's bail and issued a warrant for his
arrest Friday after the government said Guez violated the
conditions of his release after his arrest in May for threatening
the life of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland.
   After his release, Guez was sent to California, where he spent
28 days in a drug rehabilitation center. Since getting out he has
been staying with relatives in the Los Angeles area.
   Early last week, Guez came to New York on the condition that he
remain in the custody of one of his two lawyers. But the lawyers
lost track of him Wednesday and Guez appeared before Lifland on
Thursday without the lawyers.
   Lifland notified Assistant U.S. Attorney Gilbert Childers.
   Guez's lawyer, Gerald J. McMahon, argued Monday that his client
did not ``willfully violate the terms of his bail,'' and had
remained in close contact with another lawyer, Guillermo A. Gleizer.
   According to federal prosecutors, Guez, 43, threatened to kill
Lifland and the trustee he appointed to oversee Sasson's
reorganization ``if a result contrary to his interest were to be
reached.''
   The Tunisian-born Guez arrived in the United States in 1976 with
$74 and a new style of French cut jeans. Through clever advertising
he made millions, also licensing the Sasson label for watches,
lingerie and luggage.
   But the company, beset by to internal feuds, was swamped by
lawsuits leading to the Chapter 11 reorganization.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers hit hard by this year's drought should
think about enrolling highly erodible cropland in the long-term
Conservation Reserve Program, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   The current signup period for the CRP will end on Aug. 31. More
than 25.5 million acres have been enrolled in previous signups, and
the goal is to have 40 million to 45 million acres in the program
by the end of 1990.
   Under the program, farmers offer bids to take land from crop
production and plant it to grass or trees for 10 years as a guard
against erosion. In return, they get federal assistance to pay for
up to half of the cost of establishing the protective cover, plus
annual rental payments for the CRP land.
   Vern Neppl, acting executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said farmers may bid to enroll eligible
land that has not been harvested in 1988 due to drought.
   ``If their bids are accepted, the producers will receive their
first CRP rental payments in 1988,'' Neppl said. ``Also, they will
be guaranteed payments for nine more years, an additional source of
income regardless of weather condition during those years.''
   Cropland that has been hayed in counties approved for drought
relief is eligible for the CRP if it meets program requirements,
but there may be a reduction in the 1988 payment, Neppl said.
Producers also have the option of enrolling land for 1989.
   Enrollment of erodible land in the CRP will help farmers meet
the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law, Neppl said. Those
require producers to have an approved conservation plan for
erodible land in place by Jan. 1, 1990, to remain eligible for USDA
program benefits.

<HEAD>Six Accused Of Training Contra Mercenaries in Florida</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Cuban-Americans ran a mercenary training camp
in Florida to aid Nicaraguan rebels, according to a federal
indictment unsealed Monday.
   One of the six is also accused of shipping a cannon, a mortar
and other weapons to Contras under the guise of humanitarian aid.
   The Miami-area men allegedly violated the Neutrality Act, which
bans private action against a government at peace with the United
States. The indictment alleges that the defendants operated from
June 1983 to September 1986.
   ``There is no declared war against Nicaragua,'' Assistant U.S.
Attorney Mark Schnapp said. ``People don't have the option to go
down there and engage in combat on their own.''
   Eulalio Francisco ``Frank'' Castro, 46, one the two men who
allegedly financed the 60-man training camp on the outskirts of
Naples, had been arrested here in June 1983 for allegedly smuggling
loads of marijuana by sea, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
spokesman Jack Hook said Monday.
   The mercenary camp allegedly began operations the same month,
and the charges against Castro were subsequently dismissed. Hook
said he did not know why the charges were dropped.
   Schnapp turned away questions about a possible drug link to the
Contra aid operations, which has been the subject of congressional
investigations.
   ``There is no allegation of any drug shipment involved in any of
this,'' Schnapp said.
   Also indicted was Rene Corvo, who has been accused by some
witnesses before congressional committees of engaging in drug
traffic. A 1986 U.S. State Department report said there was no
information connecting Corvo's group in Miami to drug smuggling.
   Corvo, Castro, Joseph Marcos and Sergio Becerra turned
themselves in Monday before U.S. Magistrate Lurana Snow in Fort
Lauderdale, while agents were trying to contact the other two
defendants, Rafael Torres Jimenez and Francisco Hernandez.
   Corvo faces the most serious charges in the indictment, which
was prepared by the same federal grand jury that indicted Contra
leader Adolfo Calero's brother Mario Calero, ex-mercenary Jack
Terrell and others on similar charges.
   Corvo faces a maximum 38 years in prison on four weapons charges
plus counts of violating the Neutrality Act and conspiring to
violate it. The other five face only the Neutrality Act violations,
and face a maximum eight years in prison.
   In March 1985 Corvo allegedly shipped nine weapons to Costa
Rican anti-Sandinista groups through Fort Lauderdale and El
Salvador, and faces federal weapons counts, Schnapp said.
   One shipment allegedly landed on the ranch of John Hull, a
one-time CIA contact, according to congressional witnesses and
other reports.
   Schnapp said questions about Hull, if any, would be forwarded to
the special prosecutor's office in Washington.
   ``There was a portion of the overall investigation of
individuals who were facilitating Contra activities that was turned
over to the special prosecutor's office,'' Schnapp said.
   Castro and Marcos are accused of financing the camp's
operations, while Corvo and the other three allegedly trained
mercenaries, mostly Cubans and Nicaraguans, at the camp. The
activities were apparently not secret, and the camp was filmed in
1985 by a television crew, Schnapp said.
   Some of the defendants in the earlier case have argued their
activities were sanctioned and even directed by the Reagan
administration. They have a motion before Roettger asking him to
decide if the United States was really at peace with the
Sandinistas, as is required under the act.
   Schnapp said the new indictment did not include any evidence
that the men were acting on behalf of the Reagan administration.
``The indictment would indicate that they were not sanctioned,''
said Schnapp.
   Joe Adams, who pleaded guilty to Neutrality Act violations in
the earlier indictment, was sentenced to one day's probation by
U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger.

<HEAD>Federal Authorities File Suit To Deport Man Accused of War Crimes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities have begun deportation
proceedings against a Minneapolis man accused of crimes during
World War II.
   In a civil lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court Monday,
authorities allege that Edgars Inde, 79, a native of Latvia,
belonged to a commando unit known as the Latvian Auxiliary Police,
a Nazi-approved organization subordinate to German authorities.
   Federal authorities allege that as a member of that
organization, Inde participated in killing unarmed Jews and other
civilians in 1941 and 1942.
   When contacted Monday, Inde denied he killed Jews. ``No, no, no,
no, no, no,'' he said.
   The lawsuit was filed against Inde by the U.S. Attorney's Office
and the Office of Special Investigations. The suit is the first in
a series of steps to revoke Inde's U.S. citizenship and deport him,
the attorney's office said in a statement.
   The suit alleges that Inde hid his participation in war crimes
when he came to the United States 1949 and applied for
naturalization. Inde became a citizen in 1955.
   ``Because of his wartime activities and later
misrepresentations, Inde lacked the good moral character required
to enter the United States and become a citizen,'' Jerome Arnold,
U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, said in a statement. ``During the war
he assisted in the persecution of thousands of innocent citizens on
behalf of a country hostile to the United States and democracy.''
   Inde, a retired factory worker, said Monday he wants to remain
in the United States because Latvia is under Soviet control. He
referred questions to Ivars Berzins, a Babylon, N.Y., attorney.
Berzins could not be reached for comment Monday, but a secretary
said he does not discuss his clients' cases.
   Inde has 20 days to respond to the charges.
   Neal M. Sher, director of the Office of Special Investigations,
said the agency also is prosecuting others who allegedly served
with Inde during World War II.
   Sher said the founder and former chief of the commando unit,
Viktors Arajs, was sentenced to life imprisonment in West Germany
following his conviction of mass murder.
   ``OSI's investigations and prosecutions have resulted in the
removal of 19 Nazi persecutors from this country,'' Sher said.
   Twenty-nine people have had their citizenship revoked, 27 cases
are in litigation and more than 600 are under investigation, Sher
said.

<HEAD>Sun Doesn't Set on Pub Drinkers in Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britannia's waves of bitter and stout flowed
unabated Monday _ even after Big Ben chimed 3 o'clock _ as drinkers
toasted the new laws that went into effect permitting pubs to stay
open throughout the day.
   Ever since 1915, when the government moved to curb drinking by
munitions workers, all pubs, wine bars and hotel bars have been
required to stop serving alcohol between 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.
   Now they can serve beer, wine and spirits uninterrupted from 11
a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays. On Sundays, which have always had the
shortest drinking hours, alcohol now can be served from noon to 3
p.m. _ a one-hour extension _ and from 7 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.
   ``It gives us new freedom,'' said Elton Mouna, manager of the
Sea Horse pub in London's financial district. ``It doesn't treat us
like children anymore.''
   Celebrating bankers and stockbrokers jammed the pub at 3 p.m.
when Big Ben's chimes were broadcast live and town crier Alfie
Howard put down his pint of beer to give the new laws his stamp of
approval.
   ``Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! With the authority invested in me as
official town crier, I am commanded to announce that in accordance
with the licensing laws of Her Britannic Majesty, from this time, 3
o'clock henceforth, licensees shall dispense beverages for sale,''
he cried.
   In Exeter in southeastern England, landlord Shaun O'Reilly
turned the Mill on the Exe pub into a makeshift office to persuade
patrons they could do business there.
   He brought in mobile telephones, photocopiers and faxing
facilities, and drafted extra staff to act as secretaries.
   ``With portable phones and other modern gadgets, many executives
do not need to be in the office to work, and a pub is often a more
relaxed place for a business meeting,'' O'Reilly said.
   ``I would hope to see business people using the pub for late
lunches and teatime meetings,'' he said. ``This is only an
experiment ... but if it works out we will try to arrange these
facilities permanently.''
   Customer Alan Collyer, a company director, said: ``I have always
liked doing business in the pub, and with the new hours it can
become my second office. It's a lot less formal, and it's easier
for your clients to relax, especially now that you don't have to
keep one eye on your watch.''
   For the past 73 years, the bartender's warning bellow of ``Last
orders!'' has created an instant traffic jam at exactly 2:50 p.m.
as patrons clamored for one last drink before heading back to work.
   Ten minutes later, to the cry of ``Time, gentlemen, please!'' _
men still outnumber women in pubs _ Britain went dry for 2{ hours.
   Britons grew accustomed to the ritual, but it confounded parched
tourists interested in sampling traditional English ale or having
an afternoon snack.
   ``They just cannot physically understand it,'' Mouna said.
``They can't work it out. So now we won't have those problems. We
can just welcome guests in, and entertain them as we've always
wanted to.''
   Pubs don't have to change their hours if they don't want to, and
the National Licensed Victuallers' Association predicted that
almost half the 67,000 pubs in England and Wales would stick to the
old ways.
   Publicans and brewers agreed that pubs in seaside and tourist
towns and city bars will benefit most from increased trade, while
residential and country pubs probably would continue to call
``time'' on weekdays at 3 p.m.
   ``I think most people in the neighborhood are going to stay
open, as I am, for a couple of months to see what difference it
makes,'' said Aubrey Brightman, landlord of the Rising Sun pub in
central London.
   The Brewers' Society forecast at least 25,000 new jobs would be
generated by the longer drinking hours and that pubs would win back
lost trade from fast-food outlets.
   Many pub managers say they'll expand their food menu and some
have even bought coffemakers for the first time. The Sherlock
Holmes pub near Trafalgar Square began serving traditional
afternoon teas.
   The British Medical Association and anti-drinking groups oppose
the extended hours, fearing increased alcohol-related illness and
drink-related crime.
   The Scottish Office said the extended pub hours introduced in
Scotland more than a decade ago had little impact on the amount of
alcohol abuse.
   Home Office Minister Douglas Hogg said he saw no connection
between alcohol abuse and the ending of the compulsory afternoon
closing time, and many pub-goers applauded the demise of the 2:50
dash for one last drink.
   ``People would pile drinks into them because they knew that they
wouldn't be able to get another so-called social drink until later
in the evening,'' said newspaper researcher Lynn Wilson.
   ``People aren't going to rush to finish their drinks.'' added
her colleague, Jenny Leach. ``People will drink at a more leisurely
and sensible pace.''

<HEAD>13 Arabs Wounded, Abu Nidal Claims Responsibility for Grenade
Attack</HEAD>

   Israeli troops shot and wounded 13 Arabs Monday
during a strike called to protest Israeli tax raids. The
Palestinian guerrilla group led by Abu Nidal claimed responsibility
for a bombing in the city of Haifa that injured 25 people.
   A Palestinian also died of wounds suffered in a clash with
troops a day earlier, bringing to 252 the Arab death toll in the
eight-month rebellion in Israeli-occupied territories. Four
Israelis have died.
   The worst violence erupted in the coastal Gaza Strip, where
troops opened fire to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing
protesters at the Shati and Jabaliya refugee camps, Arab hospital
officials said.
   Eleven Palestinians ranging in age from 11 to 21 were shot and
wounded in the clashes, the hospital officials said. Two suffered
serious injuries and were transferred to an Israeli hospital.
   Two protesters were also shot and wounded in the West Bank, one
in the town of Nur el Shams and one in the town of Zawiyeh.
   The army imposed a curfew on Nablus, the West Bank's largest
city, and surrounding refugee camps following violent protests
overnight.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, condemned as an
``outrageous terrorist act'' the grenade attack Saturday night on a
crowded pedestrian mall in Haifa.
   Twenty-five people were wounded in the bombing, including an
8-year-old boy who lost his left leg below the knee. Four
Palestinians from the West Bank city of Jenin are being held in
connection with the attack.
   In a statement published Monday in the Beirut newspaper
An-Nahar, Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying it was in revenge for the
April 16 assassination of PLO military commander Khalil Wazir, also
known as Abu Jihad.
   Israeli officials have acknowledged privately that Israel
carried out the assassination.
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, told Israel army
radio the Haifa attack ``shows again that this struggle (the
uprising) ... is not for certain territories under Israeli rule,
but against the security and existence of Israel.''
   But Shamir's political rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of
the left-of-center Labor Party, said the attack was not linked to
the uprising. ``I think this has nothing to do with the intefadeh
(Arabic for uprising),'' Peres told army radio.
   Palestinian activists denied Shamir's claim that the goal of the
uprisng was to eliminate Israel.
   ``The purpose of the intefadeh is not to destroy Israel or the
Israeli people, but to establish a Palestinian state and end the
occupation,'' read leaflets distributed Monday in the West Bank.
   The leaflets, written in Hebrew and Arabic, also called on
Israeli soldiers to refuse service in the occupied lands.
   In Gaza, wall posters appeared overnight expressing Arab
defiance of harsh Israeli measures against firebomb throwers,
including house demolitions and deportations.
   ``We're not afraid. Our young will continue to throw
firebombs,'' said the posters, which showed youths hurling stones
and bottles at Israeli jeeps.
   Streets were deserted and stores shuttered in the occupied lands
Monday, the second day of a strike called by undergropund leaders
to protest raids in which Israelis confiscate property of Arabs
refusing to pay taxes.
   Tax boycotts have been a key source of resistance to Israeli
rule during the uprising.
   A court extended the detention of two Israeli Jews suspected of
setting fire to a shack near Tel Aviv, killing three Palestinians.
A fistfight broke out outside the courthouse when the suspects
scuffled with a television cameraman, breaking his camera, Israel
radio said.
   Ahmad Sharnobi, 22, of the Askar refugee camp near Nablus died
Monday of a bullet wound in the stomach. He was shot Sunday night
by plainclothes Israeli agents.
   The army confirmed the death and said security forces had
entered the camp to try to prevent expected riots during a strike.

<HEAD>Caretaker Cabinet Meets As Rumors Continue Of Military Coup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The caretaker cabinet of the late
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq agreed Monday to continue his
policies, and government officials denied recurring rumors of a
military takeover.
   Ismail Patel of the Ministry of Information said, ``We are
hearing the rumors but there is no basis to them.''
   U.S. Army Gen. Cloyd Pfister led a group of American
investigators to the site of the C-130 airplane crash that killed
Zia, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 other people on Wednesday.
   American and Pakistani crash experts searched the debris to
determine what caused the transport plane to explode minutes after
takeoff near the Indian border.
   Caretaker President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the former Senate
chairman who became the new leader by constitutional succession,
says he is convinced the crash was caused by saboteurs.
   Ishaq Khan, 73, held his second Cabinet meeting Monday. Patel
said the Cabinet ``discussed the continuation of Islamization,''
the process set in motion by Zia to make the Moslem Koranic code of
justice the law of the land.
   Although there was no official statement, Patel said the cabinet
decided to continue Zia's policies, including support of the Moslem
insurgents fighting the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan.
   Several officials and Pakistani newspapers reported hearing
rumors of the imposition of martial law and the arrest of Ishaq
Khan or of Army Chief of Staff Gen. Aslam Baig. Authorities said
nothing was afoot.
   There have been no reports of unrest since Zia's death ended his
11-year rule. Ishaq Khan said a state of emergency was in effect
but said it had not been necessary to invoke martial law or
restrict civil rights.
   The United States has informed the Soviet Union and India in
separate messages sent to Moscow and New Delhi that American
support for Pakistan remains strong in the wake of Zia's death.
   ``The point is we wanted to reassure them that our policy is
unchanged, and that we are going to stand by Pakistan,'' said a
U.S. official who spoke Monday in Washington on condition of
anonymity.
   Pakistan under Zia was the closest U.S. ally in central Asia and
the conduit for the shipment of American and Chinese weapons to
Afghan rebels fighting a guerrilla war against the Afghan
government and Soviet troops.

   Here are some facts and figures about Burundi:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Burundi covers 10,759 square miles, about the size of
Maryland. It is astride the main Nile-Congo dividing crest, bounded
on the west by the narrow plain of the Ruzizi River and Lake
Tanganyika. The interior is a broken plateau at an average altitude
of about 5,000 feet, sloping eastward to Tanzania and the valley of
the Maragarazi River. Its neighbors are Zaire on the west, Rwanda
on the north and Tanzania on the east.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Burundi is densely populated with 5 million people,
of whom 84 percent are of the Hutu tribe. Although the Tutsi make
up only 15 percent of the population, they control the army and
government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Some nickel deposits still are exploited but
Burundi's main economic activity, and the main source of
employment, is subsistence agriculture. Beans, kassava, maize,
peanuts, peas, sorghum and bananas are grown but the main cash crop
is coffee, which accounts for 90 percent of exports. There has been
little industrial development.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Tradition recounts the establishment of a Tutsi
kingdom as early as the 16th century. Germany occupied the country
in 1890 and incorporated it into German East Africa. In 1919 it
became part of Ruanda-Urundi, administsered by Belgium, first as a
League of Nations mandate and then as a U.N. trust territory. It
became independent in 1962 and has had several governments, the
most recent ones military.

   The Soviet Union detonated a nuclear device in the
Tyumen region of Siberia on Monday, the Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said the underground blast had a yield of up to 20,000 tons
of TNT, and was ``made in the interests of the national economy.''
   It gave no further information.
   In addition to making tests of its nuclear weaponry, the Soviet
Union sometimes uses nuclear devices underground to loosen mineral
deposits.
   The Tyumen region is one of the Soviet Union's most important
oil and natural gas regions.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Quayle Pick An Issue; Criticizes Bush On Foreign
Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis on Monday urged
voters to compare his selection of a running mate to George Bush's
choice when weighing their vote for president.
   He also said he was eager to debate his Republican opponent on
foreign policy and national security issues.
   Dukakis has shied away from direct criticism of Bush's selection
of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle to round out the Republican ticket but
on Monday said it ``obviously will be an issue'' in the election.
   ``How we make our decisions, how we make the presidential
selections, who we select ... whether or not that person should be
a heartbeat away from the presidency, obviously will be an an issue
in the campaign,'' Dukakis told a news conference in Lowell during
a gubernatorial trip to northeastern Massachusetts.
   ``This is a judgment the American people will have to make,''
said Dukakis, who last week touted the credentials of his running
mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, as a way of questioning Bush's
judgment in picking Quayle.
   ``They've had an opportunity now to watch Michael Dukakis make
his selection and Geoge Bush make his decision,'' Dukakis said.
``And they will judge us on this and other issues.''
   Dukakis criticized Bush for not yet agreeing to a debate
schedule and asked that the first face-to-face confrontation be
devoted to national security and foreign policy. Bush has
frequently criticized Dukakis as a novice at national security and
foreign policy and did so again Monday.
   ``How someone who sat there and did nothing while we sold arms
to the ayatollah can seriously talk about leadership in the Persian
Gulf is beyond me,'' Dukakis said.
   The governor filled his visit with references to his higher
ambitions, touting state health insurance, economic development and
housing programs as models he would promote nationally if elected
president.
   Dukakis was returning to his Brookline home tonight for a
briefing on national security issues to be led by William Webster,
director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Bentsen also was to
attend the briefing, one of a series the presidential and vice
presidential nominees will receive before the election. Rep. Louis
Stokes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,, and Rep. Lee
Hamilton, its former chairman, also were invited.
   Bentsen and his wife, Beryl Ann, were to have dinner with the
Dukakises prior to the briefing. Dukakis aides said the governor's
home would be checked for electronic surveillance devices prior to
the session.
   Dukakis also issued a statement supporting demonstrations in
Poland in favor of the outlawed Solidarity trade union, referring
to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa as the `true leader of the Polish
people.''
   The visit by Dukakis to northeastern Massachusetts, which he
will resume Tuesday, is part of his annual summer tradition of
visiting different regions of the state.
   As he did with a trip last week to central Massachusetts,
Dukakis began the visit at a luncheon with area officials,
educators and business and labor leaders before attending state
events that mesh with themes of his presidential campaign.
   In Lowell, a once-thriving mill city that fell on extremely hard
times in the 1970s, Dukakis announced the construction plans for a
new downtown community college at a mill complex destroyed by fire
two years ago and a $150,000 grant for a manufacturing research
center to provide technical assistance to smaller manufacturing
operations.
   The city has made a dramatic economic comeback and its former
mills have been refurbished for a variety of business, housing and
other projects. Dukakis frequently refers to Lowell and nearby
Lawrence, a city on his Tuesday agenda, as examples of how he has
encouraged economic development in struggling areas.
   ``We can do for this country ... what we have done here,''
Dukakis told the luncheon, recalling his visist last week to
struggling rural areas of Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas. ``They
too want to have to have the same hope and optimism, the same
vision of what's ahead, that you have created in Lowell,'' Dukakis
said.
   Former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas told the gathering he hoped a
visit to Lowell by reporters covering the presidential campaign
would put to rest Republican charges that Dukakis overstates his
role in the area's resurgence.
   ``We were getting irritated by those who say that Michael
Dukakis had nothing to do with the `Massachusetts Mircale,'''
Tsongas said.

<HEAD>Columnist Probably Told He Needn't Register Gun, Memo Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan probably
had been told he did not have to register a revolver he used to
shoot a teen-ager trespassing in his yard, the city government's
top lawyer says.
   However, city officials on Monday refused to drop charges
against Rowan, who has written in favor of gun control. He was
charged with possession of an unregistered handgun and ammunition
after wounding a youth who had been taking an unauthorized predawn
swim in his backyard swimming pool June 14.
   Rowan has claimed that the weapon was given to him in 1982 by
his son, Carl Jr., a former FBI agent. Both Rowans have steadfastly
maintained that city officials instructed them that the gun did not
have to be registered, since Rowan Jr. was a federal agent.
   That was buttressed by a memo written Aug. 11 from District of
Columbia Corporation Counsel Frederick D. Cooke Jr. to Police Chief
Maurice T. Turner, indicating that some police officers have erred
in enforcing the gun registration law.
   ``It has come to my attention that some officers in the MPD
(Metropolitan Police Department) have interpreted the provision so
as to exempt from registration firearms owned by MPD officers or
other law enforcement officers,'' Cooke wrote Turner in the memo,
obtained by The Associated Press on Monday.
   ``I understand further that when an officer ceases to be an MPD
or other law enforcement officer this `exempt' status is not
revoked and the former officer is not required to surrender the
weapon.''
   The city's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance, which requires
that all weapons purchased after that date be registered with the
city, should be amended to make clear that law enforcement officers
are not exempt from this regulation, Cooke concluded.
   ``Police were telling people that once they left any police
force, they didn't have to register the weapon,'' said Raoul L.
Carroll, Rowan's attorney. ``The memo makes that clear.''
   The document was included in material Carroll submitted to
District of Columbia Superior Court in hopes of getting the charges
dismissed.
   Beverly Burke, a spokeswoman for Cooke, said city officials
still intend to prosecute the columnist. She would not comment on
the memo, which she described as ``private, not something that
should be in the public domain.'' Police also declined to comment.
   Efforts to reach Rowan for comment were not immediately
successsful.
   Rowan's trial has been set for Sept. 22. If convicted of
possessing an unregistered weapon and ammunition, he could receive
up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine on each count.

   The League of Women Voters said Monday it
expects an estimated 15,000 phone calls to flood the campaign
headquarters of George Bush and Michael Dukakis pushing the 1988
presidential and vice presidential nominees to take part in
League-sponsored debates this fall.
   The calls were being made from all parts of the country by
league members and others who ``understand the importance of
nonpartisan presidential debates,'' Nancy M. Neuman, the group's
president, said Monday.
   The league has sponsored debates for the past three presidential
elections but this year faces competition from the Democratic and
Republican parties, which have announced four debates of their own.
   ``The shameless attempt by the two parties to `steal' the
debates threatens more than the league,'' Neuman earlier wrote in a
letter to league members. ``It threatens the voters.''
   Neither the Bush or Dukakis campaigns have said they would
participate in the league-sponsored debates, the first of which is
set for Sept. 8 in Birmingham, Ala.

   The Executive Committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organization on Monday wrapped up three days of meetings
without setting a date for a Palestine National Council session
expected next month in Algiers.
   A Palestinian source authorized to convey results of the
closed-door meeting said members discussed the ramifications of
King Hussein's decision in July to cut Jordan's links with the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   A senior PLO offcial, meanwhile, said Monday he expects the PLO
to proclaim an independent Palestinian state before the end of the
year.
   Salah Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, a close associate and
deputy to PLO chief Yasser Arafat, told Austrian radio that the
executive committee was reviewing proposals on the issue by various
political and judicial commissions.
   In the interview, monitored in Vienna, Khalaf said the issue
would be on the agenda of the PNC session in Algiers.
   ``Proclamation of a Palestinian government, a state will
certainly come this year,'' Khalaf said.
   Khalaf made clear that the PLO wants recognition from Israel
before the Palestinians would officially recognize the Jewish
state. He said it was the Israelis who are refusing dialogue with
the PLO.
   ``We are not prepared to give something away prematurely,'' he
said, but added that ``we are realists. Israel is there. It exists
as far as the political reality is concerned.''
   Israel refuses to deal with the PLO, which it views as a
terrorist group. Israeli leaders have denounced any attempt to set
up an independent Palestinian state.
   Khalaf was in Vienna for a day of talks with Foreign Minister
Alois Mock and Interior Minister Karl Blecha.
   The 450-member Palestine National Council, a sort of Palestinian
parliament-in-exile, is widely expected to consider setting up a
Palestinian government with a claim to the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Palestinian sources in Algiers have said they expect the council
to convene late next month.
   The executive committee is expected to meet again later this
week, after Arafat returns from Baghdad, Iraq.

   A burglary suspect who was zapped by an
electric fence and chased for a mile over hilly terrain covered in
poison ivy was relieved when police arrived to arrest him,
authorities said Monday.
   The suspect also had to jump off a 15-foot-high deck and was
barked at by a neighbor's dogs, only to end up empty-handed and
facing the man whose house he allegedly burglarized.
   ``Yes, he was glad to see police,'' Mendota Heights Police Chief
Dennis Delmont said Monday.
   The unidentified homeowner said he and his wife surprised the
burglar when they returned to their home in this Twin Cities suburb
Saturday.
   The suspect jumped off the deck and then climbed over a charged
electric fence, taking a jolt.
   The suspect then headed through a neighbor's yard where four
collies started barking. He dropped the purse he allegedly stol and
kept running, the homeowner said.
   He then ran up an embankment the homeowner described as steep,
rocky and laced with poison ivy.
   The homeowner said he finally caught up to the suspect, but both
men were so tired they could only stare at each other.
   ``I said, `Hey, Buddy, it's all over. Let's just wait for
police,''' the homeowner said. ``Neither one of us had any energy
left to hustle.''
   Police arrived within minutes and arrested the suspect, Sgt.
Dorance Wicks said. He is expected to be charged Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities
in Cyprus said Monday they will strive to achieve a settlement that
would lead to the withdrawal of Turkish troops from their
war-divided island.
   President George Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Rauf
Denktash, the president of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state,
arrived Monday at the invitation of U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar.
   At a meeting Wednesday, they are expected to discuss differences
that have fueled tensions on the island since Turkey invaded north
Cyprus in 1974 in the wake of a coup by supporters of union with
Greece. It is the first time leaders of the divided nation have met
in nearly three years.
   ``The Cyprus problem has lasted too long, 14 years of continuous
occupation of a large part of our small island is too much, and it
is high time it was settled,'' Vassiliou told reporters. ``The
withrawal of the Turkish troops is the key problem.''
   ``I want a settlement very badly,'' Denktash told reporters
earlier.
   Denktash is president of the Turkish-Cypriot Federated State of
North Cyprus, established in 1983 and recognized only by Turkey.
   He said the estimated 35,000 Turkish troops would begin
withdrawing from Cyprus only ``after the formation of a
transitional government and after the Turkish Cypriot community
begins feeling it does not need the guarantee of their continuing
presence for its safety.''
   The main obstacles to a settlement have been Greek Cypriot
demands for the withdrawal of the Turkish troops and 45,000 Turks
who have settled in north Cyprus, as well as the repatriation of
200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, one third of the island's
population.
   ``I am going into these negotiations with cautious optimism ...
I know it is not easy to find a solution and it is going to be a
long process,'' Vassiliou said.
   After the meeting Wednesday between the two leaders in the
presence of Perez de Cuellar, the talks will move to Nicosia,
Denktash said.
   Vassiliou, a businessman, entered politics for the first time in
February, when he was elected president. He has declared his
intention to settle the Cyprus problem within a year of his
election.
   By contrast, Denktash became a prominent Turkish Cypriot leader
before the island gained its independence from British colonial
rule in 1960. He has engaged in fruitless negotiations with other
Greek Cypriot leaders since tensions began in the 1960s.
   ``This new leader, Mr. Vassiliou, we are told, intends to
establish a partnership through a bi-zonal federation with us and
he has created a good reputation as a man of good intentions who
really wants a settlement, that's why we are here,'' Denktash said.
   Vassiliou told reporters:
   ``It would be nice if the Turkish troops could be withdrawn in a
day, but that is impractical. What is important is for the troops
to be withdrawn and that we arrive at an agreed solution.''
   Perez de Cuellar, who arrived Monday night, said he hoped the
talks with the two leaders will produce a date for the resumption
of the intercommunal talks ``and a climate of dialogue.''

<HEAD>Greek Orthodox Church Calls for Film to be Banned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Greek Orthodox Church said Monday it
has called for a ban on the film ``The Last Temptation of Christ''
in Greece, claiming its interpretation of the life of Jesus is
``horrifyingly vulgar.''
   Archbishop Seraphim of Athens, the Orthodox Church leader in
Greece, sent a letter to the government saying Martin Scorsese's
film would ``clash directly with the religious sensitivities of our
people.''
   ``The film attempts a horrifyingly vulgar representation of the
person of the founder of the Christian faith,'' the letter said.
   In his appeal, Seraphim cited the Greek Constitution, which
enshrines Orthodox Christianity as the country's official religion.
   Church spokesman Yiannis Hadzifoti said the letter was sent to
Education Minister George Papandreou and Minister to the Premier's
Office Akis Tsochatzopoulos ``just a few days ago,'' but so far
there had been no official response.
   In the movie's most controversial scene, the crucified Jesus
imagines making love to Mary Magdalene. Scorsese has said it
shouldn't offend audiences when taken ``in context'' as Christ's
last temptation _ to get married and lead a normal human life.
   Scorsese's film is based on a novel by Greek author Nikos
Kazantzakis, who was threatened with excommunication by the
Orthodox Church when the book came out in 1954. ``The Last
Temptation'' is one of Kazantzakis' most popular books and it is
still a big seller in Greece.
   The film is expected to be released in Greece next month ``a
couple of weeks after it's shown at the Venice Festival'' according
to a spokesman for United International Pictures, the distributor.
   It has provoked accusations by religious traditionalists that it
distorts Christian theology. Thousands of people demonstrated when
it was released two weeks ago in the United States, where it was
seen by packed houses in several cities.
   In Europe, both Protestant and Roman Catholic church groups have
denounced the film. In Britain, a conservative watchdog group is
seeking a ban on grounds of blasphemy.

<HEAD>With AM-Social Clubs Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire at a basement social club that killed
seven people in the Bronx was not arson as originally suspected,
fire officials said Monday.
   ``We believe at this point that the fire was accidental, but
many important witnesses who were badly injured have yet to be
interviewed by fire marshals,'' said Fire Department spokesman John
Mulligan.
   Arson had been suspected because of the rapid spread of the
Sunday fire.
   Dozens of injured patrons, many severely burned, remain at eight
hospitals. Eighteen firefighters also were injured, none seriously.
   The club, known as The Cave or The Hole, has been raided by
police five times since March, and there have been nine arrests,
said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for Mayor Edward Koch. ``And the people
have been let go on violations, which is not a misdemeanor. Two
misdemeanors (within a year) allows the police commissioner to
close the place under the padlock law.''
   In a raid, police confiscate liquor and money, kick everyone out
and arrest the employees, Kelly said. ``Once in a while they arrest
the patrons.''
   The club in the Bronx does not have a liquor license, Kelly said.
   Most social clubs operate like bottle clubs in other states,
where customers bring their own liquor and get mixers from the
management.
   The club was a 50-by-75 foot T-shaped space partitioned into
several rooms, with a bar at either side of the front entrance and
a disc jockey's stand at the rear. Just past the bars were several
tables and an area set aside for dancing.
   Patrons passed through a narrow doorway between a realty office
and a store. Neighborhood residents said the entrance was always
blocked by a shopkeeper's steel gate. A steel cellar door on the
side street was locked.
   Mulligan described the steep, narrow staircase that led down to
the club as ``no better than a ladder.''

<HEAD>Tough Robots To Serve Prison Inmates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rolling robots bearing meals, laundry and
mail will become servants to thousands of inmates at Alameda
County's new jail when it opens next year.
   Called the ``smart cart'' by county engineers, the boxy,
self-propelled metal delivery machine is expected to head off
mealtime violence by taking food to prisoners in the 15 buildings
instead of the prisoners going to the food.
   ``The jail layout is such that the sheriff wants to deliver the
food instead of taking inmates to a central dining area,'' said
Ruel Brown, assistant planner of the new facility.
   The board of supervisors of the county east of San Francisco has
approved a $4.8 million contract for 18 robots made by Apogee
Robotics Inc. of Fort Collins, Colo., a company that already
manufactures similar machines for several defense corporations.
   The robots, formally known as the automatic-guided vehicle
system, stand 17 inches high, two feet wide and six feet long. Each
carries about 30 food trays.
   At the new jail in Santa Rita, the $250,000 machine, which looks
like a squat filing cabinet, will be dispatched from a central area
and, guided by two miles of wire embedded in the jail's floor, will
deliver meals to the separate 96-cell housing facilities. They are
equipped with sensors which see 12 feet ahead, watching for
obstacles.
   Alameda is the first jail system in the nation to install the
robots, said Jim Jones, president of the manufacturer. The company
has produced similar robots used by IBM, Rockwell International and
Westinghouse Electric Corp. to deliver supplies, he said.
   ``It had to be designed so that (prisoners) can't hide
contraband in it,'' Jones said. ``We won't have a problem with it,
unless the staff doesn't do regular preventative maintenance
checks.''
   Sheriff's representatives say they are sure the machines will
improve security. There will be no long walks to the kitchen or
rowdy mealtime crowds, thanks to the 1,500-pound, stainless-steel
robot.
   The Alameda County Sheriff's Department plans to find out how
tough the machines really are with a test patterned after a
television luggage commercial.
   A retired sheriff's captain _ armed with confiscated
``implements of destruction,'' including an axe handle and ice pick
_ will attempt to rough up one of the robots, said Ruel Brown
assistant project planner for the jail.
   ``I'm not sure what he weighs, but he's a big man,'' Brown said.

<HEAD>Wheat Supply May Recover In 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If farmers boost plantings and the drought
eases, this year's massive drain on the U.S. wheat stockpile could
be brought under control in 1989, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   Total wheat supplies in the 1988-89 marketing year that began on
June 1 are estimated at about 3.1 billion bushels, down more than
20 percent from last season and the lowest in almost a decade, the
department's Economic Research Service said in an outlook report.
   More than 22 million acres of wheat land were idled under the
USDA's acreage program this year when farmers were required to
set-aside 27.5 percent of their base acres. For 1989, they have to
idle only 10 percent.
   ``With increased area and average yields in 1989-90, the United
States would be able to produce 2.5 billion bushels of wheat,
enough to cover likely use without a further stock decline,'' the
report said.
   Although the supply _ this year's harvest plus excess left over
from previous crops _ will be more than enough to meet expected
use, the wheat inventory by next June 1 is expected to be down to
around 597 million bushels, down from 1.266 billion bushels this
June 1.
   Based on the current rate of wheat use for domestic consumption
and exports, the U.S. wheat supply next June 1 would represent an
87-day supply, compared with reserves for 185 days this June 1. It
also would be the smallest since 1973-74.
   This year's wheat harvest of 1.82 billion bushels is far short
of the more than 2.5 billion bushels needed to cover expected
domestic and export demands in 1988-89. The shortfall of 684
million bushels has to come out of reserves.
   Thus, according to the report, the beginning inventory of 1.266
billion bushels is drawn down by the shortfall to 582 million
bushels. When imports of 15 million bushels are added, the
projected U.S. wheat stockpile next June 1 becomes 597 million
bushels.

<HEAD>Pentagon Seeking Money For Airplane `Recognition' System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has asked Congress to restore
government financing for research on advanced airplane
``recognition'' systems of a type that might have prevented the
shootdown of an Iranian airliner by a Navy cruiser.
   Such systems, if proven feasible, could make it easier for radar
centers on the ground or at sea to identify the types of planes
they detect _ for example, distinguishing between a jet fighter and
a cargo plane.
   The funding request was presented formally by Gordon A. Smith,
the assistant defense secretary for command, control,
communications and intelligence systems, just two weeks after the
USS Vincennes on July 3 shot down an Iranian A-300 Airbus carrying
290 people that the cruiser mistook for a F-14 fighter jet.
   In a letter to the House and Senate Appropriations committees,
Smith urged Congress to restore $9.2 million for research and
development of so-called ``non-cooperative target-recognition
systems.''
   Congress had cut the money from the Navy's fiscal 1989 budget
bill after discovering the Navy and Pentagon were not prepared to
commit themselves to continuing the research in fiscal 1990 and
beyond.
   The Navy says it made a decision to scrap a five-year research
program in the field because of the overall Pentagon budget squeeze.
   ``It is requested that consideration be given to a floor
amendment to restore the requested $9.2 million in Navy funding for
non-cooperative identification efforts,'' Smith wrote on July 18.
   Smith made no reference to the Vincennes incident, but added:
``The Department of Defense is striving to develop aircraft
identification systems to provide effective control of our
increasingly lethal air defense weapons. This is not an easy
problem; however, there is a non-cooperative identification
technique which has the potential to identify hostile and civil
aircraft.''
   Non-cooperative identification is military slang for any system
that doesn't rely on aircraft radio emissions to make an
identification. So-called cooperative systems, now in use by most
air forces, involve one plane determining whether another is
friendly by ``asking'' for a special radio transmission.
   The Vincennes, in mistakenly classifying the Iranian airliner as
a hostile jet fighter, apparently made a mistake in the way it
interpreted that plane's radio signal response.
   A non-cooperative system attempts to identify an airplane
without asking for a radio transmission.
   Smith, in his letter, did not include any details of the Navy
research because he said the work was classified. But he did say a
new non-cooperative system ``has been tested on one ship with very
good results.''
   The Senate already has responded to Smith's plea by agreeing to
provide the research money. The House has yet to act, however, and
the prospects for restoring the money still are uncertain.

<HEAD>IRA Bomb Kills Man Believed to be Navy Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The IRA blew up a car Monday in
east Belfast, killing a man police believe was a Royal Navy officer
only three days after eight British soldiers were slain by another
bomb.
   Police said the victim, thought to be a 45-year-old recruiting
officer, was the only casualty when the bomb exploded and the car
burst into flames Monday afternoon during rush hour, just east of
the downtown district.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, which has focused its
campaign of violence on the British security forces, claimed
responsibility in a telephone call to a Northern Ireland radio
station.
   The bomb exploded as the victim drove his gray Ford Capri over
the Queens Bridge. Freelance photographer Crispin Rodwell said he
was 50 yards behind as the car pulled away from traffic lights.
   ``As it went to move off, it disappeared in a ball of fire,''
Rodwell said. ``It was immediately underneath a flyover (overpass)
and the debris ricocheted off the underneath of the flyover.
   ``Some other cars stopped and some guys jumped out with fire
extinguishers. They tried to put out the fire but they could not
get anywhere near. They were beaten back by the flames. It was just
a fireball.''
   Three people were treated for shock at a nearby hospital.
   ``There was a woman in a silver (Volkswagen) which veered off
the road and hit one of the flyover supports,'' Rodwell said. ``I
think she was OK but she was taken away very shocked.''
   In the telephone call, the IRA said it had carried out ``the
execution of a British soldier.'' The IRA is fighting to drive the
British from Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the
province with the Irish Republic, which is 95 percent Roman
Catholic.
   Eight soldiers were killed and 27 wounded early Saturday when an
IRA bomb wrecked an unmarked military bus carrying members of the
First Battalion of the Light Infantry from Belfast airport to their
barracks at Omagh, 50 miles west. All the dead were in their late
teens and 20s and had been on furlough in mainland Britain.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Monday that
detention without trial of people suspected of guerrilla activity
had not been ruled out.
   Ken Maginnis, a Protestant member of Parliament from Northern
Ireland who urged Mrs. Thatcher to reinstate the policy, said he
gave her the names of three IRA men he claimed were involved in the
Saturday bombing.
   A letter bomb was sent to Maginnis last week, but was defused.
He claimed internment of 50-70 ``top flight'' IRA organizers would
``drastically reduce'' violence in Northern Ireland.
   Mrs. Thatcher ordered a security review after the bombing
Saturday, which was the deadliest IRA attack on the military since
1982. The attack brought to 26 the number of soldiers killed in
this summer's IRA blitz on British military targets in the
province, mainland Britain and continental Europe.
   ``You do not tell your enemy precisely what it is you are going
to do, ever,'' the prime minister told reporters who had asked what
security measures the government could introduce to protect the
soldiers. ``We must never let the terrorists win.''
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the Cabinet member
responsible for the province, promised a relentless campaign
against ``the men of evil.''
   Government sources indicated Sunday that Mrs. Thatcher and King
had decide against demands that known guerrillas be picked up, on
grounds the detentions would be a propaganda coup for the IRA.
   Then Prime Minister Edward Heath, a Conservative, introduced
internment in Northern Ireland on Aug. 9, 1971. About 2,000 people
were held without trial before Prime Minister Harold Wilson of the
Labor Party abandoned it in December 1975 amid world criticism.

<HEAD>Iraq Accuses Iran Of Moving Troops In Violation Of Cease-fire</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADD 4 grafs UPDATING with U.N. chief's comments in Geneva.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq on Monday accused Iran of redeploying
its troops along the central border region in violation of the
3-day-old cease-fire in the Persian Gulf.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Iranian troops on Saturday
and Sunday moved closer to Iraqi positions on the central front as
well as moving troops to other, unspecified ``new areas.''
   The dispatch said Iraq complained to United Nations observers in
the area, warning that unless the Iranians pulled back, Iraq would
``forcibly return them'' to their previous positions.
   ``The U.N. team intervened and asked the Iranian side to
withdraw, and the Iranian troops actually started withdrawal'' late
Monday, the dispatch said.
   The state-run agency did not identify the area beyond saying it
was on the central front, and gave no further details in its
three-sentence dispatch.
   There was no immediate response to the Iraqi claim from Iran or
from the peacekeeping force.
   At the United Nations, a U.N. official refused to discuss the
alleged cease-fire violations but said U.N. truce observers were
defusing tensions successfully on the front line.
   Spokeswoman Nadia Younes also declined comment on reports from
shipping sources in the Persian Gulf that U.N. patrol boats had
been seen cruising the Strait of Hormuz in the southern gulf and
the Shatt al-Arab waterway separating Iran and Iraq.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's report to the
Security Council calling for the establishment of the U.N.
Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group requested a naval patrol for
``certain sensitive areas in or near the Shatt al-Arab.''
   Ms. Younes declined to discuss whether the Strait of Hormuz, 525
miles southeast of the Shatt al-Arab at the opposite end of the
Persian Gulf, could be considered ``near'' that waterway.
   Both areas have been flashpoints in the nearly 8-year-old war.
The conflict broke out in the Shatt al-Arab in September 1980 when
Iraq invaded Iran.
   In Manama, Bahrain, a Kuwait-flagged cargo vessel, one of 93
vessels trapped in Iraqi waters since the war began, became the
first to reach its homeport Monday after the cease-fire.
   The owners, the Kuwait-based United Arab Shipping Co., said the
Ibn Haithem reached the Kuwaiti port of Shuweikh.
   According to Lloyd's Register of Ships, there were nine vessels
trapped at Khor Zubair, nine at the adjacent Umm Al-Qasr water
inlet, and 75 in the Shatt Al-Arab estuary separating Iraq and Iran.
   Iran-Iraq peace talks being overseen by the United Nations are
set to begin Thursday in Geneva, following a cease-fire that was
implemented Saturday as a first step in ending a conflict that has
claimed about 1 million lives.
   Iran and Iraq began observing the cease-fire Saturday morning,
but have not given up swapping accusations and counter-charges.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said an Iranian sniper killed an
Iraqi soldier Saturday, and Iran claimed Iraqi troops fired shots
near a U.N. observer team in the central region of the war front on
Saturday.
   The U.N. secretary-general's office in New York released a
letter from Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on Monday stating
that if the Iranian Navy attempts to search Iraqi ships for war
material, Iraq ``will resist it by such means as it deems
appropriate.''
   Aziz said such searches would violate the cease-fire provisions
of U.N. Security Council Resolution 598, which called for the
cease-fire, troop withdrawal, exchange of prisoners, peace talks
and establishment of an impartial commission to decide who was
responsible for the conflict.
   Perez de Cuellar told an airport news conference in Geneva on
Monday that a peace settlement will require long and tedious talks,
but ``if there is a political will the rhythm could be quite
rapid.''
   He said he may later name a deputy to lead the negotiations.
Asked when he expected a comprehensive settlement, he said this was
a ``$100,000 question.''
   The U.N. chief said a major question in the talks' initial phase
was repatriating the ``more than 80,000'' prisoners of war.
   He said he expects ``great cooperation from both sides'' on the
POW issue, and that he was pleased with the cooperation U.N.
military observers received from Iran and Iraq in monitoring the
cease-fire.

   A three-year study demonstrates that cattle
can graze safely under high-voltage power lines, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   David C. Ganskopp, a rangeland scientist for the department's
Agricultural Research Service in Burns, Ore., said the $1.7 million
field study in Oregon showed that ``farmers do not have to make
allowances for cattle if high-voltage lines are overhead.''
   The study was paid for by the Bonneville Power Administration in
the Pacific Northwest and nine other U.S. and Canadian power
companies. The 500,000-volt power line used in the study stretches
900 miles from Bonneville Dam in Oregon to the Los Angeles area.
   ``We found no significant differences in the body weights of
cattle or in the number of calves born,'' Ganskopp said.

   Paramilitary police beat and kicked about 30
people and arrested more than 100 others during protests marking
the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia,
dissidents said Monday.
   Dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants demanded a government
investigation of the ``numerous crimes'' committed during protests
Sunday and an explanation of what dissidents said was a new police
unit created to break up demonstrations.
   The arrests came during rallies marking the Soviets' 1968 move
into Czechoslovakia to stop the liberal reforms of the ``Prague
Spring.''
   Protesters who were arrested were brought into a closed
courtroom Monday and most received jail sentences of 10 to 15 days
and fines of up to $320, the dissidents said.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, provided details in a
rare report on court proceedings and carried police accusations
that protesters acted illegally.
   Tass said 96 people were arrested. But members of the Democratic
Union, a new group calling itself an alternative to the Soviet
Communist Party, claimed as many as 150 people were arrested.
   Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman for the Democratic Union, said in a
telephone interview that dozens of people remained in Moscow jails
Monday night, awaiting court appearances.
   ``We demand the creation of an investigatory group of the
Procurator of the U.S.S.R. for a full investigation of the numerous
crimes committed by the so-called law enforcement organs on Aug.
21, 1988,'' Grigoryants, editor of the dissident journal Glasnost,
said at a news conference in his Moscow apartment.
   About 500 demonstrators took part in an initial protest in
Pushkin Square, chanting ``Prague, Prague, Prague,'' when they were
prevented from holding up banners. About 500 paramilitary officers
and police charged and dispersed them.
   About 100 people took part in a later protest, which also was
broken up, dissidents said.
   Grigoryants was detained outside a police station and said he
saw several demonstrators being beaten. Dissidents said about 30
people were kicked or beaten.
   Grigoryants said Andrei Babitsky, an editor of Glasnost,
received a concussion from a beating in a police bus, and that an
ambulance was called twice Sunday evening to the police station to
treat him.
   Maj. Gen. Nikolai Myrikov, deputy head of the Department of
Internal Affairs in Moscow, harshly criticized the rally organizers.
   ``The organizers of the rally shouted provocative slogans,
carried posters whose contents were an insult to the dignity of
Soviet people, spread slanderous leaflets, and instigated those
present to illegal actions,'' the Tass report quoted Myrikov as
saying.
   Grigoryants said demonstrators were beaten by about 10 members
of what he described as a new force formed to break up protests.
   Members of the squad wore khaki clothing without insignia, heavy
black boots, and berets with markings of the Ministry of Internal
Affairs, Grigoryants said.
   A woman who was at one of the demonstrations, Anna Savankova,
said she was told by a policeman at the scene that the force was
specially trained to break up demonstrations.
   The crackdown was in keeping with the Kremlin's steadfast
defense of the Soviet-led invasion by Warsaw Pact forces on Aug.
20-21 in 1968, although some Soviets have suggested the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms crushed in Czechoslovakia resemble those now being
tried in the Soviet Union.

   The commander of the next space
shuttle mission said Monday the nation's manned space program could
not survive another tragedy like Challenger and predicted it would
not happen on his flight.
   ``I have great confidence in the machine; we feel it is a much
safer machine,'' Navy Capt. Rick Hauck told the final news
conference he and his crew will hold before their launching,
scheduled for late September or early October.
   ``We clearly could not afford to lose another vehicle, much less
another crew,'' Hauck said. ``I don't think the manned spaceflight
program could withstand another Challenger on STS-26 (Hauck's
flight).
   ``That's high stakes, but I'm not concerned that that's going to
happen. In the last year and a half, I've seen how we've modified
the machine and how we've done business. So I feel very comfortable
with the flight.''
   Hauck will command Discovery on the first shuttle mission since
Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch on Jan. 28, 1986,
killing the crew of seven.
   His crewmates will be Air Force Col. Richard Covey, the pilot,
and mission specialists George Nelson, Mike Lounge and Dave
Hilmers, a Marine lieutenant colonel.
   Hauck said NASA has been hesitant to set a new date for the
often-postponed launch because engineers are still troubleshooting
two problems that developed during a test firing of Discovery's
engines on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral on Aug. 10.
   One is a small leak of hydrogen gas detected in an area where
the orbiter is joined to the external fuel tank. The other is the
apparent sluggishness of three gaseous oxygen valves in the fueling
system.
   ``There are some concerns about both of these,'' he said. ``We
have to understand these better.''
   NASA officials said earlier they did not think the problems were
serious, that they were testing both systems and that they hoped to
be able to announce resolutions and a launch date later this week.
   Hauck said the Discovery mission ``is very important to the
nation and to the space agency in getting back to flying.''
   Lounge said he realized ``this is an important flight and our
country will be looking at us, but I don't feel any pressure
because of it.''
   Covey reported the four-day flight will be less complicated than
most previous shuttle missions because NASA has elected to take a
conservative approach on this first post-Challenger mission.
``We're not breaking any new ground,'' he said.
   But Covey said because of 210 modifications made to the orbiter,
the crew in essence will be making a shakedown flight of a new
spacecraft. ``We will have time to concentrate on those changes,''
he said.
   The astronauts' main goal is to deploy a communications
satellite. They also will conduct 11 science and technology
experiments.
   The Challenger disaster was blamed on a faulty joint in one of
the shuttle's two solid fuel booster rockets. The rocket has
undergone more than 50 modifications.
   Hauck said he is confident the rockets will work but ``the first
two minutes of flight will be the most tense because the solids are
converting so much kinetic energy. Once the solids have burned out
and fallen away and we're in smooth main-engine flight, my pulse
rate will drop,'' he said.
   Hilmers said at launch time the crew's thoughts will be with the
Challenger astronauts.
   ``We'll be thinking of them, but our thoughts will be more on
the future than on the past,'' he said. ``The Challenger tragedy
was a great tragedy for the nation and a tragedy for each of us. We
can't dwell on it because if we do we might repeat the mistakes of
the past.''
   Hauck was asked if his crew was taking along any momentoes or
was planning any ceremony in space for the Challenger astronauts.
   ``On the day when we have our press conference from space, we
will share them with you,'' he replied. The press conference is
scheduled during the third day of the mission.

<HEAD>Playboy Coy About Paula Parkinson's `New Comments' On Quayle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Playboy will publish ``new comments'' from a
former female lobbyist about a vacation during which she shared a
cottage with vice-presidential candidate Dan Quayle and two other
congressmen, the magazine's managing editor said Monday.
   Paula Parkinson's remarks about events at the Florida cottage
eight years ago will appear in the text accompanying a ``Women of
Washington'' pictorial in the November issue, said Playboy Managing
Editor Jonathan Black. Parkinson will appear nude in the pictorial,
he said.
   Black declined to reveal what Parkinson said.
   ``The article originally was written well in advance (of
Quayle's selection by the GOP),'' said Black. ``She was mentioned
in the story, but we had no plans to run her picture.
   ``After Quayle was picked, we got back in touch with her, did
some additional work, and inserted the new material three days
ago.''
   Black declined to answer further questions about the article or
its contents. The magazine is scheduled to be on the newsstands
Oct. 1.
   Parkinson first appeared nude in the magazine in 1980, several
months after being identified as the Washington lobbyist who shared
a cottage with Quayle and two other Republican congressmen, former
Reps. Tom Railsback of Illinois and Thomas B. Evans of Delaware.
   Parkinson said she had an affair with Evans, who later left the
House. Quayle, now the junior senator from Indiana, has said he did
not have an affair with Parkinson. Quayle has never been accused of
intimacy with the former lobbyist.
   A Justice Department investigation of Parkinson's relationships
with members of Congress found no impropriety.
   ``She didn't sleep with Quayle,'' said society columnist Rudy
Maxa, a longtime confidant of Parkinson who was acting as an
informal spokesman for her last week.
   Questions about the incident were revived last week when George
Bush named Quayle as his GOP running mate.
   ``That's been looked into and there's absolutely nothing to
it,'' said Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III when the issue
resurfaced.
   At the time of the incident, Parkinson was 30 years old and a
lobbyist for an insurance industry group that opposed legislation
to set up a national crop insurance program. The bill passed in the
House by a 235-150 vote in September 1980, but Quayle voted against
it.
   The Justice Department investigated Parkinson's activities in
connection with allegations of a sex-and-influence scandal but
dropped its case in August 1981 without filing criminal charges.
   Playboy's managing photo editor, Gary Cole, said Sunday night he
thinks the picture of Parkinson posing nude was taken in the early
'80s.

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Treaty Signed</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   RUACANA, South-West Africa (AP) _ Military representatives from
South Africa, Cuba and Angola signed a treaty Monday formally
ending hostilities in southern Angola.
   A cease-fire went into effect on Aug. 10, but the treaty
formally declared an end to the fighting and provided for a joint
military monitoring committee to be formed.
   The accord was concluded after three days of meetings near
Ruacana, a town in South-West Africa about 200 yards from the
Angolan border,
   According to the South African Press Association, the treaty, in
English, Spanish and Portuguese, was signed by Lt. Gen. Leopoldo
Cintras Frias of Cuba, commander of Cuban and Angolan troops; Col.
Antonio Jose Maria, the Angolan presidential secretary for defense
and security; and Maj. Gen. Willie Meyer, commanding officer of the
South-West African Territorial Force.
   The accord is part of an overall agreement among the three
nations calling for South African troops to withdraw from Angola by
Sept. 1; for independence to begin for the South African-controlled
territory of South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, by Nov. 1,
and for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   UNITA, the guerrilla group supported by South Africa and the
United States, is not part of the negotiations. UNITA _ or National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ has vowed to keep
fighting the Marxist Angolan government until it agrees to
negotiate.
   The South-West African People's Organization, or SWAPO, which
has been fighting for more than two decades to end South African
rule over South-West Africa, reportedly said it would abide by the
cease-fire if South Africa did the same. The report came from the
Zimbabwean news agency, Ziana, which quoted SWAPO information
officer Charles Mubita.
   The South African Defense Force said Monday that a 19-year-old
soldier died Friday ``in action against terrorists in the
operational area when the vehicle in which he was traveling was
struck by an RPG-7 rocket.'' It gave no details.

<HEAD>Uncut Version Of Sinclair's `Jungle' Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The original, uncut version of Upton Sinclair's
novel ``The Jungle'' will be published in October, eight decades
after the original shocked the nation with its expose of squalid
conditions in the Chicago stockyards.
   Sinclair cut his original manuscript by a third for the 1906
Doubleday, Page edition to make the book more marketable, according
to Gene DeGruson, a professor and curator of rare books at
Pittsburg State University in Kansas, The New York Times reported
Monday.
   DeGruson said he pieced together the original novel from a
truckload of rotting paper given to him in 1980 by a young man who
had been hired to clean out the cellar of a farmhouse in Girard,
Kan. The man recognized Sinclair's name on the business records,
memos, correspondence and other material and brought the boxes to
the university library instead of the dump.
   ``The Jungle'' had been serialized for seven months in The
Appeal to Reason, published in Girard. It was the
largest-circulation weekly newspaper in the country and the
flagship paper of the Socialist movement in the United States. The
house where the material was found apparently belonged to a friend
of the managing editor of The Appeal.
   When Doubleday published the book it caused meat sales to slump
and spurred President Theodore Roosevelt to order an investigation
that led to the nation's first Pure Food and Drug Act.
   Considering the material that was expunged, ``it's amazing that
the published book had any impact whatsoever,'' DeGruson said.
   ``Revision was drastic,'' DeGruson wrote in the introduction to
the new edition, due in October from St. Lukes Press of Memphis,
Tenn. Sinclair changed the ending to make it more upbeat and added
a love story, among other revisions, he said.
   Most of the deletions pertained to the Socialist Party, which
Sinclair joined in 1902, but he also omitted passages criticizing
the press, big business and marriage.
   Sinclair was the author of more than 90 books, including ``The
Dragon's Teeth,'' which won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1942. He died
in 1968 at age 90.

   A hearing will be held in London
so six members of the African National Congress can testify for
colleagues being tried in South Africa on treason and terrorism
charges, a judge ruled Monday.
   Judge H.R. Daniels granted a defense request that a commission
be named to hear evidence abroad from members of the outlawed
guerrilla group fighting white domination in South Africa. The
hearing is expected next month.
   Defense lawyers contended active ANC members, who could not come
to South Africa for fear of arrest, were the only people in a
position to rebut evidence from state witnesses.
   One of the three defendants is Ebrahim Ebrahim, described by the
government as the highest-ranking ANC commander captured in the
past 20 years.
   Daniels said Johan Herhold, a partner in the London law firm of
Shepstone and Wilie, would take evidence at the special hearing and
that cross-examination of the six ANC members would be allowed.
   The ANC has fought a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961.
Its exile headquarters are in Lusaka, Zambia, and the ANC's London
office is one of its largest.

   JERUSALEM _ The number of Palestinians traveling to jobs in
Israel from the occupied lands has declined by nearly 20 percent in
the 8-month-old uprising, and workers say fear of attack by Jewish
extremists is a major reason.
   The loss of manpower has caused serious problems in construction
and agriculture, which are dependent on cheap Arab labor.
   Only about 85,000 of the 105,000 Palestinians who worked in
Israel before the rebellion began last Dec. 8 still hold those
jobs, said Arie Pikel, the Labor and Welfare Ministry spokesman.
   He said most Arabs who had stopped working in Israel were
unskilled day-laborers who were not registered with authorities and
received no social benefits.
   Israeli employers want to replace the Palestinians with imported
labor. The initial response was negative, but Labor and Welfare
Minister Moshe Katzav has begun approving such requests.
   Many Palestinians quit their jobs because of pressure from
leaders of the uprising and gangs of masked youths who enforce the
leadership orders. Buses taking Palestinian workers to Israel are
stoned and workers who defy orders to strike are threatened.
   Recently, increasing anti-Palestinian violence inside Israel has
added a new dimension to the problem.
   Last Saturday, a Palestinian guarding a construction site in
downtown Tel Aviv told police a gang of seven Israelis beat him
unconscious.
   A shack was set on fire on a construction site in Tel Aviv's Or
Yehuda suburb two weeks ago, killing three sleeping workers from
the Gaza Strip.
   The attack inspired riots in the Gaza Strip and the army imposed
a three-day curfew.
   Police arrested two Israeli suspects and said Monday
investigators found the fire to be criminal and not related to the
Arab-Israeli political conflict.
   Many Palestinians say the increasing tensions keep them closer
to home.
   Fadel Mohammed Qik, 21, of the Arub refugee camp near Bethlehem,
opened a photography studio after leaving a job as a watchman in
Israel that paid the equivalent of $360 a month.
   ``Even if I make only $180 a month, it's better to work in the
refugee camp than in Israel,'' Qik said.
   Qik's 50-year-old father, Mohammed, and his brothers, Zakariyeh,
17, and Nabil, 16, also have stopped working in Israel and are
unemployed. According to residents, about half the 2,000
Palestinians from Arub once employed in Israel no longer work there.
   Some raise chickens to survive the hard times, and a few
operations have become commercial with up to 1,500 fowl.
   Abdel Fatah Khamis, 22, said he used to sleep in Tel Aviv rather
than make the 35-mile trip home to Arub, but has gone home each
night since the Or Yehuda fire.
   Parliament member Amnon Linn, an Arab affairs expert in the
Labor Party, said Jewish violence against Arabs was not widespread.
He called it the work of ``marginal groups on on the fringes of
Israeli society.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Defends His Own Use Of Deferments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis denied allegations Monday
from a New York congressman that the Democratic presidential
nominee used college deferments to avoid combat in Korea, saying
``I served my country proudly.''
   Dukakis attended Swarthmore College from 1951-55, asking for and
receiving deferments in 1952, 1953 and 1954. He said he went to his
draft board with several weeks of school left and asked to be
drafted immediately.
   Dukakis served in the Army for just under two years, including
16 months as part of a United Nations contingent assigned to the
demilitarized zone in Korea. The fighting ended in that country in
July 1953.
   ``I served my country, I served my country proudly,'' Dukakis
told reporters.
   Dukakis pointed out that he could have gotten additional
deferments by enrolling in law school but asked to be drafted
instead. He was discharged in 1957 and attended Harvard Law School
upon his return.
   ``I was anxious to do my military service,'' he said.
   Rep. Jerry Solomon, R-N.Y., ranking GOP member of the House
Veterans Affairs Committee, called reporters to point out the
deferments.
   ``I just want to point out that Dukakis received his first of
three educational deferments eight months before the Korean War
ended,'' Solomon said in Chicago, where he was to receive an award
from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. ``My point is not to point
fingers at Dukakis, because what he did was legal. But he avoided
combat by using his education deferments. There's nothing wrong
with what he did because it was allowed.
   ``The point is the press has made a big thing out of Dan Quayle
joining the National Guard. (But) Dan Quayle stood a chance of
being sent into combat,'' while Dukakis didn't, Solomon said. ``We
really ought to be putting this aside and get on with the
seriousness of the campaign. I don't think the campaign should be
bogged down in this non-issue.''
   Dukakis said his military background was common knowledge and he
dismissed Solomon's criticism.
   ``I don't think it's a coincidence that a Republican congressman
raised it,'' he said. ``It will be up to the Republican Party to
explain all this.''

<TEXT>
   The Chubb Corp. wants to make sure this
summer's drought doesn't claim another victim along with parched
crops: the company's reputation.
   Stung by criticism that it backed away from drought insurance
and left thousands of farmers high and doubly dry, the Warren-based
company has set up a crisis center, mobilized phone-answering
troops for toll-free numbers and taken out newspaper ads.
   ``They're meeting this like meeting a (natural) catastrophe _
you set up a crisis center,'' said Gloria Vogel, who follows the
company for the investment bank Bear, Stearns & Co.
   ``I think the company has done the best they can,'' she said
Monday.
   Chubb has said applications for the insurance far exceeded the
original $30 million in coverage it had authorized. In response to
the demand, the company later increased the authorized amount to
$40 million.
   Chubb has paid about $20 million to farmers who applied for the
coverage before the June 15 deadline but after the coverage limit
had been reached. Chubb is the nation's 16th largest property and
casualty insurer, with a net worth of $2.1 billion as of June 30.
   Management appointed a senior underwriting officer, Terry
Vangilder, to handle the company's response to the complaints, said
spokeswoman Mary Lou Korkuch, who said she has spent a
``substantial amount of time on this question'' in the past two
months.
   The efforts are aimed at repairing ``the damage that may have
been done to our reputation and really get back on track,'' she
said.
   But to Davenport, Iowa, attorney Terry M. Giebelstein, who has
sued Chubb on behalf of 2,000 Iowa farmers, the campaign ``doesn't
address the fundamental issues: The entitlement of the farmers to
the policies.''
   Chubb says that despite its authorization for only $30 million
in insurance, agents offered an estimated $400 million to nearly
9,000 farmers in Ohio, Minnesota, Indiana, Iowa, Illinois,
Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
   The policies specify that Chubb had to approve the applications
before they were accepted, the company said. Only 1,160 were
approved, said Ms. Korkuch.
   Farmers across the Midwest have sued, and a federal judge in
Cincinnati recently granted class-action status to one suit. The
others probaby will be consolidated there, said Giebelstein. State
insurance regulators also are examining the company.
   But all may be sound and fury signifying nothing, depending on
the weather.
   Because the policies are pinned strictly to the cumulative
amount of rain for a given area from June to Aug. 31, rain before
the deadline could render the matter moot.
   Already enough rain has fallen recently to relieve the company
of its obligation for about half the $40 million in coverage
already granted, said Gail Devlin, Chubb's senior vice president
for finance.
   ``We'll just have to wait until Aug. 31 and see how it shakes
out,'' Giebelstein said when asked whether he would continue the
legal action despite the rain. ``If it rains enough, it's hard to
complain.''

<HEAD>Albanian Leader Condemns Yugoslav Policies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Albanian leader Ramiz Alia said in a
speech reported Monday that Yugoslavia is producing ``sinister
propaganda'' in an attempt to blame its ethnic discord on Albania.
   In a speech Sunday to a rally in Peshkopia near the Yugoslav
border, Alia denounced criticism of ethnic Albanians who live in
the adjacent Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the official Albanian
news agency ATA said Monday. Ethnic Albanians make up nearly 90
percent of Kosovo's population.
   Alia said the alleged Yugoslav campaign has ``taken aim even at
those few rights'' recognized in the Yugoslav constitution.
   ``The difficult problems Yugoslavia is undergoing now are not
solved and cannot be solved at the expense of the Albanians,'' Alia
said.
   Serbs and Montenegrins in Kosovo claim they are harassed by
ethnic Albanians. At least 30,000 held a rally Saturday in
Titograd, in Montenegro near the Albanian border, to protest such
harassment.
   More than 30,000 people have left Kosovo since bloody riots in
1981, when some ethnic Albanians demanded greater autonomy.
Official figures say most of those who left were Serbs and
Montenegrins who claimed discrimination by the Albanians.
   Last week, an Albanian-language daily in Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, reported 9,000 ethnic Albanians also had left the province
but said the reasons were economic rather than political. Kosovo is
a rural province with much less development than the rest of
Yugoslavia.

<HEAD>Barthelemy Hopes Voters Will Approve Property Fee After Convention
Success</HEAD>

   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy disclosed Monday that
the city faces a $19 million budget deficit this year and said
officials kept the shortfall secret to avoid negative publicity
during the Republican convention.
   The mayor proposed a two-year ``property service charge''
designed to raise $10 million to help bridge the gap. Voters have
turned down two revenue raising proposals since Barthelemy took
office in 1986, but the mayor said he hopes a wave of good feeling
that swept the city during the GOP national convention would
generate support for his proposal.
   ``This last week was a spectacular week,'' said the mayor. ``I
think people felt a sense of pride in the city.''
   If the City Council approves the idea, a proposal for a flat
$125 fee on properties would be put on the November ballot. If
approved, the city would collect this year's fee in December.
   Spending cuts and other adjustments also would be needed to
balance the city's $280 million budget, said Kurt Steiner, the
mayor's chief administrative officer.
   Barthelemy said city officials realized in July there would be a
shortfall after the Louisiana Legislature _ facing its own fiscal
crisis _ cut funding for the city by $7.5 million. City tax
collections also are coming in below budget, officials said.
   But officials kept a lid on the news, Barthelemy said, so as not
to offset the good publicity the city was getting during last
week's convention.
   ``I think the positive press that we would have gotten would
have been countered by the `City in Crisis' or the `City Faces a
Deficit,''' Barthelemy said.
   Barthelemy, a Democrat, has been dealing with financial problems
since taking office. In 1986, he wiped out an impending $30 million
deficit by laying off workers, putting city employees on a four-day
work week and shutting down City Hall one day a week.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Demand 15 Years For Former President's Brother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors asked Monday that a
brother of former President Chun Doo-hwan be sentenced to 15 years
in prison and fined $5.84 million on charges of embezzling public
funds, taking bribes and peddling influence.
   Chun Kyung-hwan, 46, is accused of taking 7.6 billion won ($10.5
million) in embezzlement, extortion and bribes while head of the
Saemaul Movement, a semi-official community development project.
   At the closing session Monday, senior prosecutor Lee Myung-jae
said the younger Chun deserved a heavy penalty for amassing an
illegal fortune by using Saemaul projects as cover. The Saemaul
Movement, once heavily subsidized by Chun Doo-hwan's government,
oversaw development projects in both urban and rural areas.
   Lee said the defendant showed no remorse and refused to admit
most of the alleged wrongdoing despite the evidence and testimony
from witnesses. He was arrested soon after his brother left the
presidency in February at the end of a seven-year term.
   Court officials said a verdict and sentencing in the case are
expected Sept. 5.
   It was the first prosecution of a corruption case arising from
the Chun administration. But the National Assembly, in which the
government party has lost its majority, has set up a special
committee to investigate alleged irregularities involving the
former president and his family.
   The prosecution also demanded prison terms ranging from one to
seven years for 11 other defendants, most of them former Saemaul
officials, who are charged with embezzlement, breach of trust, tax
evasion and other offenses.
   In his final statement to the court, Chun Kyung-hwan asked for
leniency because of his efforts on behalf of the Saemaul Movement.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Nile Floods Easing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi of Sudan said
Monday a drop in the Nile River water level would diminish flooding
in three days but the critical time lies ahead: early September,
when the rainy season peaks.
   Mahdi said foreign news media had exaggerated the effects of the
floods. His comments were carried by Egypt's official Middle East
News Agency in a dispatch from Khartoum, capital of Sudan.
   He said the Blue Nile's level at Dima, Ethiopia, about 530 miles
southeast of Khartoum, fell by four inches Monday and would be
followed by a drop in the water level in Sudan.
   ``This means that, however heavy the flood is today and
tomorrow, it will diminish in three days,'' the agency quoted him
as saying. ``The time to be reassured about the Nile flood is the
first week of September.''
   Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 caused flooding in northern, eastern
and central Sudan that killed more than 90 people, destroyed at
least 150,000 dwellings and left 1.5 million people homeless _ more
than a third of Khartoum's nearly 4 million inhabitants.
   Health officials predict epidemics of water-borne diseases as
people cut off from drinking water supplies are forced to drink
from standing pools.
   Thousands of people already have developed diarrhea. Malaria and
typhoid are on the rise and cholera is an imminent risk.
   The last flood of similar magnitude was in 1946, but Mahdi said
his country was coping better this time. He said foreign news
reports potrayed ``a drowning Sudan, with spreading plagues and the
first threat of locusts in a thousand years.''
   He acknowledged, however, that swarms of locusts are expected to
invade Sudan from neighboring Chad and Nigeria and will threaten
five million acres of cultivated land. He said the government had
22 airplanes ready to spray affected areas and enough insecticides
for 15 days.
   ``Sudan will fight the danger, with assistance from friends,''
he said.

<HEAD>Wiesenthal Center Says It Obtained Names Of 44 War Criminals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Romania and the Soviet Union opened their files
to the Simon Wiesenthal Center to help track down pro-Nazi war
criminals now living in Canada and America, the center's Canadian
representative said Monday.
   Sol Littman, who spent several weeks this summer in Bucharest,
Romania, and Vilnius, Lithuania, said he has forwarded 44 names to
the Canadian Justice Department's war crimes unit and the Office of
Special Investigations in Washington.
   He said the names would not be released publicly until U.S. and
Canadian authorities had time to investigate the allegations.
   Littman said the lists include 16 suspected members of the
Romanian Iron Guard who are thought to be living in Michigan and
elsewhere in the United States and seven believed to be in Canada.
Another 21 people are suspected of being Lithuanian police
militiamen iving in Canada, according to Littman.
   He said all the suspects are wanted in Romania and the Soviet
Union for war crimes, including the murders of Jews and other
civilians. Lithuania, a Baltic republic, was taken over by the
Soviet Union during World War II.
   The Los Angeles-based Simon Weisenthal Center is dedicated to
tracking down Nazi war criminals who have evaded arrest and help
bringing them to trial.
   Littman, Canada's leading Nazi hunter, said the files showed
many Iron Guard members were imprisoned after participating in
revolts in 1939 and 1941 in unsuccessful efforts to overthrow
Romania's conservative government headed by Ion Antonescu.
   He said Nazis stationed in Romania during World War II helped
them escape and many entered camps for displaced persons before
making their way to Canada, the United States and Argentina.
   The Wiesenthal Center had reported in 1981 that some Iron Guard
members were living in North America.
   Romania became a partner of Nazi Germany during World War II and
the Wiesenthal report said, ``Frustrated by the (Romanian) army,
which remained loyal to Antonescu, the Iron Guard turned on
Romania's Jewish minority.
   ``In one of the cruelest pogroms in history, hundreds of Jews in
Bucharest and Jassy were beaten to death on the streets, women and
children mutilated, and the bodies of victims hung in abattoirs on
meat hooks.''
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Wiesenthal Center said the former
leader of the Iron Guard, who he identified as Horia Sima, is now
living in Spain.
   ``These groups are still prevailing in the West, continuing to
preach the same fascist ideology and raising a second and third
generation,'' Littman said.
   He accused the Canadian government of acting slowly in its
investigation of suspected war criminals. The Wiesenthal Center
says Canada has acted against only two alleged war criminals since
legislation was passed last year permitting trials of the suspects
in Canada.
   Former Hungarian police Capt. Imre Finta is awaiting a
preliminary hearing in Toronto on charges stemming from the
deportation of Jews in 1944 and the government is trying to deport
Jacob Luitjens of the Netherlands, now an instructor at the
University of British Columbia, who is accused of collaborating
with the Nazis.
   The Wiesenthal Center has said as many as 6,000 war criminals
came to Canada after World War II. A government commission reported
last year that only 20 cases required urgent action and another 218
were worthy of investigation.

   A panel of bishops will be appointed to
study the reports of miracles at a charismatic church where three
parishioners claim to receive messages from the Virgin Mary,
Lubbock's bishop has announced.
   About 12,000 people gathered on the grounds of St. John Neumann
Catholic Church on Aug. 15 to celebrate the Feast of the
Assumption, after the parishioners said Mary told them miracles
would occur on that day.
   During the Mass, hundreds reported seeing apparitions of Jesus
and Mary in the clouds, while others claimed that the evening sun
appeared to dance in the sky and that silver-colored rosaries
turned a golden hue.
   ``I am asking the National Conference of Catholic Bishops to
assist me in preparing an investigation of the event and a panel of
specialists will be appointed shortly for this task,'' Lubbock
Bishop Michael Sheehan said in a statement issued late Friday
afternoon. It was his first comment on the Mass since the
apparitions were reported.
   Sheehan's secretary said he declined to speak to reporters.
   A spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in
Washington said the organization has no involvement in the
investigation. ``He is free to set up his own investigation and ask
experts in on his own, but the national organization has nothing to
do with that,'' said Joe Lipovsky.
   Sheehan said he also has talked with an official from the office
of Pope John Paul II's envoy to the United States. ``An
investigation of this kind is normal and the panel will be charged
with studying the authenticity of the events,'' the statement said.
   The three parishioners say they began receiving messages from
the Virgin Mary earlier this summer, shortly after they returned
from a pilgrimage to Medugorje, Yugoslavia, where six youths claim
they have seen apparitions of Mary since 1981.
   Hundreds have begun attending Monday night rosary services in
which Mary Constancio, Theresa Werner and Mike Slate read aloud
messages they claimed to have received.
   The church has printed books containing these messages and more
than 50,000 copies have been distributed.
   In his statement, Sheehan said he has asked St. John Neumann
pastor Monsignor Joseph James not to promote or print the books
until the investigation is concluded.
   Calls to James' office Monday for comment were not immediately
returned.
   Sheehan said earlier that people shouldn't assume anything
supernatural is happening at the church.
   ``I take a cautious attitude about the rosary messages spoken
about by several parishioners at St. John Neumann,'' he said in
July. ``I neither encourage people to participate in the events nor
do I discourage them.''

<HEAD>CBS Poll: Bush Up Although Voters Question Quayle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican convention boosted George Bush to
a narrow lead in the presidential race, although many voters harbor
doubts about Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate, a
national poll said Monday.
   Half the respondents in the CBS News survey said they did not
believe Quayle has the experience to be a good president, and
another 28 percent were unsure. Thirty-nine percent said they
wished Bush chose someone else.
   Bush nonetheless led Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis by 46
percent to 40 percent in the poll of 1,221 registered voters
nationwide. Dukakis, enjoying his own convention bounce, had led by
17 points early this month.
   The survey was the first conducted entirely after the GOP
convention in New Orleans ended Thursday with a well-received
speech by Bush. It found favorable views of Bush and confidence in
his leadership well up from their pre-convention levels.
   But voters expressed reservations about the qualifications and
background of the 41-year-old Quayle, who has faced a barrage of
questions about his enrollment in the National Guard during the
height of the Vietnam War.
   Forty-nine percent of the respondents said phone calls made on
behalf of Quayle to the guard represented ``an unfair attempt'' to
gain his admission; 40 percent said such calls were acceptable and
21 percent were unsure.
   Among the seven in 10 who had heard of the issue, 48 percent
said they believed Quayle had joined the guard to avoid the draft.
Just 29 percent believed that was not his main reason, and 22
percent said they didn't know.
   Also among those who had heard about it, just 50 percent
believed Quayle was telling the truth about the National Guard
issue, while 26 percent said he was not and 24 percent didn't know.
   Quayle also did not do well in comparison with the Democratic
nominee for vice president, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. Forty-one
percent said Bentsen would be a better vice president, to 28
percent for Quayle. The rest didn't know.
   Bush received a mixed rating for his handling of Quayle's
selection. Forty-seven percent rated it fair or poor, 44 percent
said good or excellent. But twice as many said poor _ 18 percent _
as said excellent, 9 percent.
   Still, backing was up for the Republican ticket as a whole. The
Bush-Quayle ticket led by 10 points among men and roughly tied
among women, 44-42. It led by 18 points among the youngest voters,
age 18-29; among the oldest, 64 and up, the race was a 41-41 tie.
   The six-point spread in the race was just within the poll's
margin of error of plus or minus three points. But several recent
polls have shown Bush gaining and Dukakis dropping from his
post-Democratic convention lead, allowing the conclusion that the
Republicans lead slightly. In a Gallup poll this weekend they led
by nine points, 51-42.
   Bush was expected to gain in popularity following the publicity
from his convention, just as Dukakis did after the Democratic
convention. Such bounces in the polls generally settle as the
campaign progresses.
   On Bush's personal ratings, 51 percent in the new poll said they
had faith in his ability to deal wisely with an international
crisis, while 37 percent would be uneasy. His rating on this
question in a CBS News-New York Times poll early this month was the
precise opposite.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, did far worse on the confidence measure: 53
percent uneasy, 29 percent confident.
   Bush was rated favorably by 39 percent and unfavorably by 25
percent in the new survey, much improved from his
favorable-unfavorable rating of 27-33 in the previous poll. Still,
27 percent were undecided in their opinion of Bush, and 8 percent
said they had not heard enough about him, after his nearly eight
years as vice president.
   Dukakis, who came in for sharp criticism at the Republican
convention, saw his favorable-unfavorable rating drop from 38-19
before the GOP convention to 32-25 after it, with 29 percent
undecided and 13 percent saying they had not heard enough.
   Efforts by the Republicans to paint Dukakis as a liberal had
little effect; 34 percent saw him as a liberal, compared with 35
percent in the earlier poll. But 34 percent said it was more likely
Dukakis would raise taxes, up from 27 percent in early August.
   Bentsen was rated favorably by 21 percent and unfavorably by 12
percent; the rest hadn't heard enough or were undecided. Quayle
scored 24 percent favorable to 18 percent unfavorable.
   Forty-two percent said Bentsen had enough experience to be
president, 23 percent said not and 35 percent weren't sure. For
Quayle, just 22 percent said he had enough experience, 50 percent
said not and 28 percent were unsure.
   Asked if they were glad Bush picked Quayle, 33 percent said they
were, 39 percent said they wished he chose someone else, 12 percent
volunteered that it didn't matter and 16 percent didn't know.
   The poll was conducted Friday through Sunday.

   The United States is reducing the
number of military air operations to be flown over the Persian
Gulf, but has made no decision to remove warships from the area,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.
   When a reporter said the Soviet Union had urged that the United
States withdraw its naval forces from the gulf in view of the new
cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, Fitzwater declined comment.
   But he added:
   ``We have said in the past that as the threat diminishes in the
gulf, so would our presence. We are taking some actions at this
time to allow certain activities that have been suspended in the
past, primarily things like port calls, number of sorties flown off
the carriers, a few of those kinds of things are being changed to
reflect a more relaxed atmosphere following the cease-fire, but at
this point there has been no decision to remove ships from the
gulf.''
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said a decision was made over the weekend to fly fewer
sorties and to make more port calls to allow sailors to rest, since
there is less need to patrol.
   Fitzwater said there had been no changes in the ``rules of
engagement,'' the standing operational orders given U.S. military
commanders.
   Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Keith Schneider said that since the
cease-fire went into effect, the situation in the gulf has
stabilized and ``the number of operational requirements has been
somewhat lessened.''
   He said sorties flown off Navy aircraft carriers include both
training exercises and missions to defend U.S. units in the gulf
against real or perceived threats.
   ``The number of flights, therefore, fluctuates from day to day
and as the threat to our forces in the gulf decreases, the number
of operational flights required would also diminish,'' Schneider
said.
   He also said that while the Defense Department has a policy
against discussing ship schedules in advance, ``if operational
requirements for ships ... actively patrolling diminishes, we will
arrange additional port calls for rest and recreation for the
crews.''

   Gravediggers in northern Burundi have
counted the bodies of about 5,000 people massacred in battles
between members of the Hutu and Tutsi tribes, government officials
said Monday.
   Government and U.N. officials in neighboring Rwanda said at
least 35,000 Burundians crossed the border into Rwanda to escape
the slaughter last week.
   In Washington the State Department said no Americans were in the
areas of the killings.
   Foreign Minister Cyprien Mbonimpa of Burundi included the first
official death toll in an official communique issued at a morning
briefing for diplomats.
   It also was read during the 1 p.m. newscast on government radio,
according to diplomats who spoke in telephone interviews from
Bujumbura, capital of the small, densely populated country in
Central Africa. They asked that their names not be used.
   ``It said the people in charge of burying the bodies have
counted approximately 5,000,'' a Western diplomat said, but whether
that was the total dead was not unknown immediately.
   ``It appeared as if they had concluded their work, but it was
not at all clear,'' he said. ``The facts are very, very unclear and
sketchy because of the remoteness of the area.''
   He said there appeared to have been no major violence since
about 24 hours after the fighting began Aug. 14 between the Hutu,
Burundi's majority tribe, and the Tutsi, the minority tribe that
controls the military and government.
   Members of the Hutu and Tutsi tribes are old enemies. After a
coup attempt in 1972 in the former Belgium colony, the Tutsi
massacred 100,000-300,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's
intelligentsia, according to human rights groups.
   ``The news didn't start coming down to Bujumbura until late
Tuesday and Wednesday,'' the diplomat said. ``The army went in on
Tuesday and got things under control fairly quickly.''
   Mbonimpa, the foreign minister, described a media report that at
least 24,000 people were killed as ``highly exaggerated,'' another
diplomat said, and ``from every report, including those from
non-governmental sources, no one believes that figure.''
   Neighboring Rwanda's state radio said Monday that 35,000 people
had crossed the border.
   Rwanda and Burundi, former Belgian colonies, are among the
world's most densely populated countries. Rwandan officials said
resources were being strained by the influx of refugees.
   In Brussels, the European Economic Community and Belgium said
they would send a planeload of tents, blankets and other emergency
aid for the refugees worth the equivalent of more than $700,000.
   According to Rwanda's official radio, monitored in Nairobi,
officials of the neighboring country met Sunday at the border town
of Butare, where the refugees were gathered. It gave no details.
   Burundi claims last week's violence was caused by expatriate
Hutus who infiltrated northern Burundi from foreign countries and
incited Hutus to massacre Tutsis.
   The Hutu People Liberation Party, an exiled opposition group,
accused the Tutsi-dominated military of massacring thousands of
Hutus, but diplomatic sources said there was no evidence of that.
   More than 90 percent of the population is Hutu in the northern
area around the Marangara and Ntega rural communes, where most of
last week's killings occurred.
   Burundi's communique said the government had the situation under
control and the military, the ruling Union of National Progress
party and the bureaucracy had been ordered to ``show restraint,''
one of the diplomats said.
   ``It said the policy of the government was one of respect for
human rights and of ethnic reconciliation,'' he reported.
   Maj. Pierre Buyoya's government has restricted travel between
towns and is not allowing trips into the north, the diplomats said.
A 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew is in force throughout the country and
meetings of more than five people are prohibited.
   The tribal battles were the first significant violence reported
in Burundi since Buyoya seized power in a bloodless coup Sept. 3,
1987, while then-President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza was abroad.
   Nearly 5 million people live in Burundi, which is about the size
of Maryland. Its population is 84 percent Hutu and 15 percent
Tutsi. Roughly the same tribal proportions apply in Rwanda, which
is slightly smaller than Burundi.

   The FBI opened its defense Monday in a
discrimination trial by presenting four hours of statistics
designed to show that Hispanics are promoted as rapidly and
disciplined as fairly as other FBI agents.
   ``Hispanics have no problem getting into management,'' Dr.
Rebecca Klemm, an independent statistical consultant, testified.
``They get what they ask for in terms of promotions.''
   The 311 Hispanic agents who joined in the class-action suit in
U.S. District Court contend the FBI discriminates against Hispanics
in hiring, promoting, disciplining and assignments. They want
damages and changes in FBI policies. About 400 of the bureau's
9,000 agents are Hispanic.
   During the first week of testimony, about 40 FBI agents
testified that Hispanics are transferred more often to undesirable
offices, are given more assignments that are either less glamorous
or more dangerous and receive less recognition for their successes.
   The FBI opened the second week of the trial with Ms. Klemm, who
disputed findings of Dr. Gary LaFree, a sociologist at the
University of New Mexico. LaFree testified last week that Hispanic
FBI agents are less likely to hold higher-level jobs.
   Ms. Klemm used the same raw numbers culled from the FBI as
LaFree but reached different conclusions. LaFree testified last
week that 15 percent of Hispanic FBI agents with at least five
years of agency experience are managers, compared with 21 percent
of non-Hispanic FBI agents with the same level of experience.
   Ms. Klemm testified that Hispanics have done better head-to-head
against Anglo agents when competing against them for promotions _
that 14.4 percent of Hispanics got such promotions versus 10.5
percent of Anglo agents applying for the jobs.
   She did not say how many people from each ethnic background
applied for competitive promotions.
   She said Hispanics have an average of about two years less
experience than their Anglo counterparts when they attain the
bottom rung of the management ladder in the FBI.
   ``In terms of career advancement, they advance timely,'' she
testified. ``Therefore, even if they do different things as
Hispanic agents, they do fine as far as advancement.''
   The suit was filed in January 1987 by Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez,
who contends he was forced by superiors in Washington, Los Angeles
and elsewhere to accept demotions he didn't deserve. Perez, now the
No. 2 agent in El Paso, used to be in charge of the San Juan,
Puerto Rico, office and was second-in-command in Los Angeles before
his transfer to El Paso.
   The non-jury trial is expected to end Friday and U.S. District
Judge Lucius Bunton is expected to reach a decision within six
months. Federal employees are not entitled to jury trials when
suing the government in discrimination cases.
   Hispanic activists have said a multitude of discrimination
trials could result if the plaintiffs win. Hugo Rodriguez, a former
FBI agent and the co-counsel for the plaintiffs, has compared the
case to those fought by blacks in the '60s and by women in the '70s.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO To Seek Restrictions On Polish Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO said Monday it will petition the
Reagan administration to restrict Polish exports to U.S. markets
under provisions in the new trade bill that are designed to
safeguard workers' rights.
   ``We certainly believe the worker rights provisions of the trade
legislation should be applied in the case of Poland,'' said AFL-CIO
President Lane Kirkland. ``They should be denied access to the
American market under those provisions since they are in violation
of worker rights.''
   Kirkland made the comments on Monday as the Polish government
ordered troops to secure major industrial plants and clamped
curfews on three provinces hit by pro-Solidarity strikes following
a week of the worst labor unrest since 1981.
   The trade bill Reagan is to sign Tuesday in a ceremony before
Long Beach, Calif., dockworkers includes a provision permitting the
U.S. trade representative to retaliate against countries that deny
worker rights such as recognition of free trade unions.
   Kirkland said he was told by the Polish Embassy here last week
that his request for a visa to visit the country had been turned
down for a third time.
   The United States last year imported some $261.5 million in
products from Poland, primarily canned meat, fish, plates of iron
steel, nails, clothing and glassware.
   AFL-CIO officials said the retaliation that the federation would
seek from the Reagan administration could take several forms,
including revoking Poland's most-favored-nation status as a trading
partner.
   The Reagan administration revoked that status in 1981 upon the
imposition of martial law in Poland but gradually restored it, with
the AFL-CIO's approval, after martial law was ended.
   Revocation of most-favored status would raise the U.S. tariffs
on imports from Poland. For canned pork, as an example, the tariff
would jump from a penny a pound to 3.25 cents a pound. The tariff
on cast iron pipes would jump from 8 percent to 25 percent.
   Also Monday, the AFL-CIO elected new Teamsters President William
McCarthy as a vice president of the federation and to a seat on its
policy-setting executive council.
   McCarthy fills the vacancy on the 35-member board left by the
death last month of his predecessor at the Teamster's helm, Jackie
Presser.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain in Plains, Record Cold in Parts of Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The summer of 1988 took an uncharacteristic turn Monday as
thunderstorms dumped heavy rain on parts of the Plains and
overnight temperatures hit record lows in parts of the Northeast.
   Storms buffeted several Plains states with gusty winds and heavy
rain, helping to replenish some drought-sapped soil and causing
some isolated flooding in parts of Iowa.
   In northwest Iowa, Sioux Center recorded over 6{ inches of rain
overnight and Monday morning. The downpour pushed the Floyd River
at least 1 foot above flood stage in places and caused minor
lowland flooding. Several other locations in that corner of the
state reported at least 3 inches of rain by morning.
   ``It might help the lawns some,'' said Keith Hora, president of
the National Corn Growers Association. ``And the football fields
will be green. But the corn is history.''
   The rain should help late-maturing bean crops and activate
herbicides, preventing carryover chemical damage next season, Hora
said.
   Elsewhere in Iowa, Des Moines got an inch and two-thirds of rain
in the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT while Waterloo, Ottumwa and
Cedar Rapids had about 1\ inches. St. Cloud, Minn., recorded 1{
inches in the same period.
   Morning thunderstorm winds gusted to 63 mph at the Omaha, Neb.,
airport.
   Midday showers and thunderstorms also hit northeast Colorado,
northwest Kansas, eastern Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota,
Minnesota, Iowa, northwest Missouri, northeast Illinois and
Wisconsin.
   Showers and thunderstorms also remained over the Gulf Coast and
the northern half of Florida and along the Georgia and South
Carolina coast.
   Astoria, Ore., set a record high for the date with a reading of
78 degrees.
   Several other cities set cold records with their early morning
lows. Syracuse, N.Y., hit a low of 43 degrees; Youngstown, Ohio,
39; Boise, Idaho, 45. Harrisburg, Pa., tied its low of 50.
   Frost was expected Monday night in the Adirondack Mountains of
New York and the Green Mountains of Vermont.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 56 degrees at Crescent
City, Calif., to 103 degrees at Manhattan, Kan. The nation's low
Monday morning was 25 degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Tuesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
Great Lakes to the Ohio Valley, and from southern Louisiana to
northern and central Florida. Showers and thunderstorms also were
expected over southeast Missouri and central Arizona.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 60s in eastern New England; in
the 70s from the rest of New England to the Virginia coast and
across the Great Lakes to northern Minnesota and North Dakota; in
the 70s and 80s along the California coast; and in the 80s from
western Pennsylvania to Georgia, in the Ohio Valley and most of the
middle and upper Mississippi Valley and central and northern
Plains, the southern Rockies, the upper Missouri Valley and
northwest Washington state.
   Highs were predicted to be near 100 degrees from north-central
Texas to southern Oklahoma and Arkansas, and over southwest Oregon;
and near 110 in the desert Southwest. Highs elsewhere were expected
to be in the 90s.

   The government on Monday ordered troops to
secure major industrial plants and clamped curfews on three
provinces hit by pro-Solidarity strikes following a week of the
worst labor unrest since 1981.
   The illegal strikes raised a ``specter of anarchy'' over Poland
and were a ``glaring violation of peace and order,'' said Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak.
   The army general, appearing in uniform on national television,
said it was the duty of Poland's leaders not to allow the country
to return to ``the situation before Dec. 13, 1981'' _ the date that
martial law was imposed to suppress the outlawed trade union
federation Solidarity.
   Kiszczak, also commander of the nation's police forces, said it
was his duty as interior minister to ``assure elementary
discipline.''
   Even before he spoke, strike organizers said riot police stormed
two strikebound streetcar depots in Szczecin and a bus depot near
the city, evicting the workers and detaining at least 150 of them
in the first police action in the week of labor unrest.
   In addition to authorizing curfews in the provinces of Szczecin,
Katowice and Gdansk, Kiszczak said he ordered law enforcement
forces ``to strengthen external protection'' around factories and
to prevent outsiders from being present in the plants.
   Kiszczak said the army was asked to allot troops to ``assure the
continuity of city transport everywhere it has been immobilized,''
and misdemeanor courts were advised to jail violators in summary
proceedings rather than merely fining them.
   Katowice is the southern province where miners in Poland's
Silesian coal fields have been striking for a week for higher pay
and recognition of Solidarity. Hundreds of workers at the Lenin
shipyard in Gdansk _ the birthplace of Solidarity _ joined the
strikes Monday, seizing the main gate of the facility, chanting the
name of the banned union and waving Polish flags.
   Kiszczak said the strikes were being carried out by only a
minority of workers at the affected plants, but had dire
consequences for the economy.
   Sit-in strikes were in effect Monday in 13 state enterprises
employing more than 90,000 workers.
   ``Depending on further developments of the situation we shall
reach for appropriate measures which are available within the
existing law,'' Kiszczak said, speaking in deliberate tones for
between five and 10 minutes, and making no mention of the police
raid in Szczecin.
   Wroclaw opposition leader Jozef Pinior said after hearing the
speech on television that ``The authorities may succeed in
pacifying the strikers now, but the wave of strikes will return in
one, two or three months.''
   Romuald Ziolkowski, chairman of the strike committee at the
Dabie bus depot in Szczecin, said that during the raid, the riot
police were throwing strikers ``into police vans like pigs.''
   ``There was crying and screaming there,'' he added.
   Raids also occurred at streetcar stations and at the bus depot
in Police, a city outside of Szczecin, about 7 p.m., Ziolkowski
said.
   About 100 people were at each of the three depots, and 50-70
people were detained at each site, he said. The strikers were
greatly outnumbered and ``they resisted passively,'' he said
without elaborating.
   Before the police action in Szczecin, authorities had detained
at least 10 people nationwide and threatened criminal charges
against strike organizers.
   ``We must fight for reforms. We must fight for Solidarity. There
is no other way,'' Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told a crowd of
young workers at the 10,000-worker Lenin shipyard. The shipyard has
been in ailing financial shape and is under threat of closure, but
has symbolic importance as the birthplace of the Solidarity trade
union eight years ago.
   The ongoing strikes at 10 coal mines were costing the country
$1.3 million a day, the government said. Coal exports are a major
source of hard currency to repay Poland's daunting $39 billion
foreign debt, the biggest in the East bloc.
   Some Gdansk port workers also began striking Monday, according
to Western journalists in the city. A Solidarity spokesman, Jacek
Kuron, said 3,000 dockworkers in the city were on strike.
   Although the shipyard strike had been announced in advance,
police did not interfere as workers marched around the sprawling
yard bearing Polish national flags and took over the main gate at
8:35 a.m.
   Later in the morning, riot police moved in to cordon off
approaches to the yard.
   In scenes reminiscent of a nine-day strike at the shipyard in
May that ended without a settlement, strikers chanted Solidarity
slogans and posted banners on the shipyard fence, helping some
supporters who had been locked out to scramble over the gate.
   Shortly after, Walesa arrived in a red compact car and rallied
the strikers.
   ``Everything is closed and the whole shipyard is on strike,''
Walesa said later by telephone from his home in Gdansk.
   Walesa was spending the night in the Lenin shipyard with about
1,000 strikers, said union adviser Adam Michnik. Sources said
police allowed Walesa, because of his stature, to re-enter the
plant after the cordon was in place.
   In the phone interview from his home, Walesa blamed the strikes
on authorities, whom he said have refused to engage in dialogue
with workers.
   ``I wanted to avoid strikes,'' he said. ``We shouldn't be
striking. We should be working. But there was no other choice ...
We are still waiting for serious talks.''
   None of the shipyard's towering cranes appeared to be operating,
and a foreman speaking through a fence said all departments were
shut down.
   Workers could be seen strolling, taking naps or perching on
fences and walls around the yard.
   ``If you work only eight hours a day, you make 40,000 zlotys
($89) a month, and that's not enough to make a living,'' said one
man in his mid-20s.
   Opposition groups reported at least 10 instances of unrest at
various factories around the country Monday.
   Activists in Warsaw reported an attempt to start a strike at the
14,000-worker Ursus tractor plant outside the capital. Police
dispersed a morning rally at the plant and detained three people,
activist Maciej Jankowski said.
   A management spokesman at Ursus confirmed an unsuccessful
attempt to strike at the plant, but made no mention of police and
said work continued normally.
   In southeastern Poland, Solidarity organizer Ewa Kuberna said
workers rallied at the 18,000-employee Stalowa Wola steel mill and
heavy machinery plant, and a strike was launched by 2,000 of the
workers.
   Opposition spokesman Wojciech Maziarski also reported new
strikes or partial strikes at the Cegielski turbine works in
Poznan, the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw and the Railroad
Construction Enterprise of Szczecin.
   Government spokesman Ryszard Straus said he had no information
about any stoppages at Cegielski or the Szczecin railroad
enterprise.

   A senior Hezbollah cleric said Monday the
holders of foreign hostages in Lebanon should stick to their
demands ``until death.''
   Sheik Sobhi Tufaili spoke to 25,000 Hezbollah faithful marking
the death of the Shiite Moslems' most revered saint, Imam Hussein.
   In a clear reference to Islamic Jihad, the group that holds at
least two American hostages, Tufaili said:
   ``I turn to those holding the prisoners (foreign captives) in
Lebanon, although we do not accept to hold the hostages. I tell
them: Adhere to your demands. Do not let go of them or retreat
until death.''
   Demands made by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, include
release of prisoners form Arab and foreign prisons, release of
Lebanese and Palestinians from Israeli jails and withdrawal of
Israeli troops from south Lebanon. It has specifically demanded
freedom for 17 Shiites imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S.
and French embassies there in 1983.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, has Iran's support and is widely
believed to be the umbrella organization for Shiite extremist
groups holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon, who
include nine Americans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Tufaili closed his remarks by declaring to hostage holders:
``You must protect them (the demands) by all means.'' Listeners in
the ancient city of Baalbek beat their chests with fists and
chanted: ``God Is Great!''
   Hussein, the Shiites' martyr, and a group of his followers were
massacred in 680 in what is now the Iraqi province of Karbala in a
leadership fight between Moslem factions. Moslems subsequently
formed the Shiite and Sunni sects of the faith.
   Other parades and observances were held Monday in Beirut's
southern slums and in south Lebanon, where thousands of Shiites
slashed their heads with razors or beat themselves with swords,
axes or iron bars. Blood dripped from the faces and chests of men
and children as they re-enacted the killing of Hussein.
   No deaths were reported in the special parades, known as Ashoura.
   In southern Nabatiyeh, traditionally the focal point of the
Ashoura, 50,000 people gathered in the main square to re-enact the
killing. Afterward, scores sliced themselves with razors and
clubbed themselves with swords or axes. Some lost consciousness and
were taken to hospitals for treatment.
   In southern Beirut, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah delivered a
sermon to mark the anniversary. He is the sect's most influential
cleric in Lebanon and the reputed spiritual guide of Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
   Fadlallah gave his sermon in the air-conditioned Bir el-Abed
Mosque. The hostages, who include nine Americans, are widely
believed held in Hezbollah's Hay Madi barracks building, about 10
blocks from the mosque.
   Fadlallah omitted his habitual references to foreign hostages
but accused the United States and Europe of trying to snatch ``our
natural resources and then claim them as theirs.''
   ``When we say `Death to America' we mean death to the aggressive
policy of America, death to the colonial policy of America and not
death to the people of America,'' Fadlallah said.
   ``We are open to the American people, mostly to the oppressed
blacks who are being treated as second-class citizens,'' he added.
   When the sermon ended, about 10,000 faithful _ including
hundreds of women and girls clad in black chadors that covered
everything except for their eyes _ began their parade in the areas
they control in war-torn south Beirut.
   Many of the marchers carried either red flags, symbolizing
Hussein's blood, or black ones for mourning.

   Actor Robert Wagner and singer Laura
Branigan were among a dozen Americans added to a list of performers
who have appeared in South Africa despite that country's racial
segregation system.
   The list is compiled by the U.N. Center Against Apartheid.
   Other Americans placed on the list are actors Robert Forster and
William Windom, actress Jennifer O'Neill, singers Della Reese and
Bonnie Bianco, theatrical directors William Levey and Aaron Norris,
conductor Joel Rosenberg, opera singer Janice Yoes and violinist
Lyndon Taylor.
   The center's report, released this month, said the people whose
names were newly added to the list appeared in white-controlled
South Africa in 1987-88.
   More than 500 individuals ang groups from 33 countries and
territories are on the list, which dates back to 1981.
   An individual may be removed from the list by writing to the
center and promising not to appear again in South Africa until that
country abolishes its policy of apartheid.
   Among the Americans deleted from the latest list are Cher, Frank
Sinatra, Paul Anka, Eartha Kitt and the Bellamy Brothers.
   The U.N.'s Special Committee Against Apartheid, which the center
serves, said in a foreword to the report, that artists and
entertainers, ``representing a most sensitive and freedom-loving
part of humankind are capable, by their example, to exert an
important influence on public opinion and can contribute positively
to world action against apartheid.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Some of the Americans still on the center's list for visits to
South Africa are singers Ray Charles, Glen Campbell, Rita Coolidge,
Janis Ian, Ann-Margret, Johnny Mathis, Linda Ronstadt and Neil
Sedaka and the rock-music groups America, Sha Na na and Village
People.
   The Britons added to this year's list, the fifth issued by the
center, are the bands Nazareth and Wishbone Ash, ballet teacher
Margaret Barnes, writer Luanshya Greer, actress Moira Lister,
pianist David Lively, playwright Eric Paice, dance teacher Sue
Staples and actor Jeremy Taylor.

   A 3-year-old boy playing along the bank
of a river in the western Amazon jungle was crushed and swallowed
whole by a 45-foot anaconda, newspapers reported Monday.
   They said the boy's father tried in vain to save him from the
jaws of the anaconda, a long, heavy South American snake of the boa
family.
   ``The boy, Daniel Menezes, had accompanied his father, Joao, to
the river to catch fish. With fish in hand, the father started
walking to his small wooden shack a few feet away when he heard
screams. He looked back and he saw his son's neck in the jaws of
the snake,'' said Jorcene Martinez, a reporter for O Estadao
newspaper.
   Martinez spoke to The Associated Press by phone from the jungle
city of Porto Velho, 2,045 miles northwest of Sao Paulo.
   He quoted the father as saying the incident occurred Aug. 8
along the Jaru River.
   ``It took the family two weeks to travel the more than 185 miles
to Porto Velho, where they told us what had happened,'' Martinez
said.
   He said the father rushed to his home, grabbed an old rifle and
``ran back to the river in a desperate attempt to save his son. But
when he got to the river he saw the anaconda had already crushed
his son's bones and had started swallowing the body. There was
nothing left to do.''
   Menezes is an impoverished peasant who plants ``manioc root and
hunts and fishes to feed his family,'' Martinez said.
   The Jaru winds through thick jungle and is infested with
man-eating piranha, alligators and snakes, Martinez said.
   The anaconda, one of the world's biggest non-poisonous snakes,
kills by crushing its victims, then swallows them whole.

   Federal police seized three Brazilians
on kidnapping charges and freed unharmed two Canadian businessmen
who were being held for nearly $500,000 ransom, police and
diplomatic officials said Monday.
   A fourth gang member, identified as Alberto Sarmiento Martin of
Venezuela, is being sought, federal police spokesman Paulo Marra
said.
   Marra said 35 police agents surrounded the kidnappers Sunday and
freed Roger Desy and Camille Cote of the Desy International
livestock company of Montreal as a company employee was about to
hand over $60,000 in cash at the airport of Goiania, 135 miles
southwest of Brasilia in central Brazil.
   The two Canadian men, both in their mid-40s, had been held since
Aug. 17, he said.
   The Canadian Embassy in Brasilia said Desy and Cote came to
Brazil on Aug. 14 to conclude a sale of cattle to a Brazilian group.
   ``Apparently there was a falling out with some of the members
over commissions. Last week we heard the people (Desy and Cote)
were being held against their will, and it evolved into a
kidnapping and extortion,'' embassy spokesman Robert Benoit said by
telephone.
   Benoit said the Desy company was contacted for the ransom.
   He said Brazilian federal police were alerted though diplomatic
channels and that Canadian police also were notified.
   Marra said Brazilian authorities were unaware of the cattle deal
and that the two Canadians were officially in the country as
tourists.
   He said the kidnappers demanded $60,000 in Goiania in exchange
for one of the hostages. The other was to be released in exchange
for an additional $437,000 to be delivered in Zurich, Switzerland.
   A police team surrounded the agreed-on exchange point at 8 a.m.
and surprised the kidnappers when they showed up nine hours later,
he said.
   The police spokesman identified the three Brazilians arrested as
Joaquim Nunes and brother Luiz Rosa Lino and Divino Rosa Lino.
   Desy and Cote remained in Goiania on Monday being questioned by
police through an interpreter, Benoit said. The two were go to
Brasilia and return to Canada on Tuesday.

   A former dean at the Indiana University
School of Law said Monday he was confident Dan Quayle received no
special consideration when he gained admittance to the school in
1970.
   ``I'd bet a dollar against a doughnut there was nothing unusual
or irregular about his admission to law school,'' said Prof.
William F. Harvey, the dean from 1973 to 1979.
   ``I was familiar with admissions during the '70s and am
confident if there had been something wrong I would have known
about it,'' Harvey said.
   Quayle's father, meanwhile, also challenged allegations that
family influence helped his son gain admittance to the law school
or secure a state job.
   Harvey, who taught the 41-year-old Republican vice presidential
nomineee during his last year of law school, described him as a
``very solid'' student.
   ``I remember him well enough to say without reservation that he
is not a lightweight or superficial,'' Harvey said. ``I had a high
regard for him. He was a very hard worker, gave excellent
recitations and had a very keen perception of the law.''
   Harvey made his comments shortly after current deans of the law
school said at a news conference in Indianapolis that school policy
prohibited them from making public any confidential information
related to Quayle's admission to the school.
   Associate Dean G. Kent Frandsen, who is acting dean in the
temporary absence of Dean Norman Lefstein, had huddled with other
top administrators at the law school all day Monday figuring out
how to reply to press inquiries about Quayle, said Charlotte
Wright, spokeswoman for the law school news bureau.
   A report published Sunday in The Plain Dealer in Cleveland
alleged that Quayle did not meet the admissions requirements for
the law school, but gained entrance after meeting with the
admissions dean, a Republican judge in a city where Quayle's family
owned the local newspaper.
   The candidate's father denied that charge.
   ``What people are trying to say is that Danny got his way paid
in to law school, '' said James C. Quayle. ``They're trying to
build him up like an aristocrat and then tear him down.''
   The elder Quayle, publisher of the Huntington Herald-Press, said
there was no truth to accusations that his son was admitted to the
law school with the help of his maternal grandfather, Eugene C.
Pulliam, publisher of several newspapers in Indiana and Arizona.
   ``Mr. Pulliam was a great philanthropist and he gave money all
the time to lots of schools in Indiana, as well as to zoos and
hospitals,'' Quayle said. ``But I'd risk my arm on the fact he
never gave money to the law school. His interest was in journalism
and getting better journalists.''
   Quayle described himself as the ``proverbial C+ student'' during
an interview Monday on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' but said
that his family played no role in his admission to law school.
   ``What Danny did is he went down and talked somebody at the
Indianapolis law school and pointed out that he went to a private
school,'' the elder Quayle said of his son, who graduated in 1969
from DePauw University a small liberal arts college in Greencastle.
   Quayle, in a telephone interview, conceded that his son ``hadn't
put his academic skills together'' while at DePauw.
   ``He was no Mensa, but it was his thought that he probably got a
better education because they had much smaller classrooms and the
curriculum was defined for them,'' Quayle said. ``Somehow he
convinced them.''
   The young Quayle's personality also helped gain him a spot in
1970 on the staff of Attorney General Theodore L. Sendak, according
to Medford S. Evans, who was instrumental in directing the aspiring
lawyer to the Statehouse job.
   ``I think he probably got himself hired in the interviews,''
said Evans, a former editor, political columnist and editor at the
Pulliam family owned Indianapolis News. ``Danny Quayle was an
impressive young kid.''
   ``I would guess they (Sendak's staff) would take a look at
academic records but I think they would be influenced also by how
he handles himself,'' Evans said. ``This is an office that dealt
with the public.''
   Evans, who now is a staff member of the Washington-based
National Journalism Center, denied that family members pulled
strings for the Indiana senator, who worked his way through law
school.
   ``If the Quayle family had been that thick with the state
government, there would not have been any reason to contact me,''
said Evans, who contacted Sendak's office on behalf of Quayle, who
was then 22.
   Quayle's father also disputed that the family is enormously
influential in Indiana, as has been widely reported.
   ``People keep saying (Quayle) is from a prominent family, but I
tell you we run a paper with 9,500 readers. That doesn't carry a
lot of weight,'' the elder Quayle said.
   ``I like my new prominence,'' said the senior Quayle. ``The only
thing is I can't find the wealth.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's largest labor
federation said Monday it would call a strike by its 3.5 million
members next month to protest the economic policies of President
Raul Alfonsin.
   The walkout was scheduled for early September but an exact date
will not be set until later this week, said Saul Ubaldini,
secretary-general of the General Labor Confederation.
   The one-day general strike would be the 12th walkout organized
by the labor group since Alfonsin took office in December 1983. A
march by thousands of workers in the capital also is planned.
   The strike is being called to protest government economic
policies that union leaders say have caused serious inflation and
eroded the purchasing power of workers.
   Most Argentine unions belong to the federation. Its 11 previous
general strikes have been peaceful and fairly successful, shutting
down government offices and public transportation, although private
businesses have remained open.
   The cost of living rose 178 percent during the first seven
months of this year. After it increased 25.6 percent in July,
Alfonsin devalued the austral by 11.4 percent against the dollar,
implemented budget cuts and instituted a system of voluntary price
controls.
   Wages have not kept pace with inflation, and prices continue
rising despite voluntary controls.
   The labor federation has demanded an increase in the minimum
monthly wage, from the current $66 to $121. The federation on
Friday rejected the government's offer to boost the minimum wage to
$79.
   Alfonsin is asking the International Monetary Fund for $1.2
billion and the success of his economic recovery plan is a key
issue in the May presidential and legislative elections. Argentina
has a $56 billion foreign debt.
   Half of the 254 seats in the House of Deputies and about
one-third of the 46 seats in the Senate will be up for election in
May. A new president will take office in December 1989, when
Alfonsin's six-year term expires. Alfonsin is barred by the
constitution from running again.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Begin Using Federal Funds For General Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush are delving into the $92 million taxpayer-funded trough for
the general election, with Dukakis getting to his share first.
   Dukakis got a headstart on Bush by receiving his party's
nomination almost a month before the Republicans formally picked
Bush last week.
   That meant he got his $46.1 million from the federal Treasury
earlier and has already spent $1.8 million, according to July
financial reports available Monday at the Federal Election
Commission.
   Bush, however, has wasted no time in laying the groundwork for
his general election campaign. He had borrowed money against the
$46.1 million he stood to receive once he became the official
nominee.
   Bush had spent $672,570 on his general election effort as of the
end of July, his financial report shows. He borrowed money he
raised during the primary campaign for his ``compliance fund,''
used for expenses to comply with election law administrative
requirements.
   Unlike the primary campaign, the candidates do not have to raise
money privately for the general election. They receive $46.1
million from the federal fund that is supported by the voluntary $1
checkoff on individual tax returns.
   As the general election campaign gets under way, the candidates
have invested heavily in polling and in media production for ads
that will be used between now and November.
   Dukakis invested more than $300,000 in polling last month.
   Bush has been spending more money getting ready for the TV wars,
paying more than $127,000 during July for media production and
consulting to the firm of his media consultant Roger Ailes.
   In addition to what the candidates are allotted, the Republican
and Democratic party organizations can spend $8.3 million each to
help elect their nominees. The limit applies to direct spending,
but the parties also have devised other ways to indirectly help
their tickets, through use of so-called soft money for generic
party activity. Those efforts will result in spending many times
the limit on direct party support.
   Dukakis closed out the last month of his primary campaign having
spent $21.7 million against the federally imposed $23 million limit
on primary spending, his reports showed. He still owed $469,000 in
outstanding bills, and his campaign committee was owed nearly that
much in receiveables.
   Bush, who was scrimping to keep from topping the limit by the
end of the campaign, was up to $22.6 million against the $23
million cap at the end of July. He was owed $255,183 and had
$61,446 in debts.

<HEAD>Study: American Youth `Staying Younger Longer'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young people in the United States are living
at home longer, marrying later and taking more time to become
self-sufficient, according to a government report released Monday.
   Assistant Education Secretary Chester E. Finn Jr. said the study
of youth aged 14 to 24 indicates they are ``staying younger
longer.''
   ``They seem to be becoming autonomous, self-supporting
individuals at a slower rate than was once the case,'' Finn said.
   The report, titled ``Youth Indicators: Trends in the Well-Being
of American Youth,'' was compiled from information that had been
collected since 1950 at federal agencies and private organizations.
   Finn said the figures show young people ``are living with their
parents longer and they are slower to form their own families.''
   ``A number of indicators suggest that the transition from
childhood to adulthood is taking longer and presenting more
pitfalls than was the case several years ago,'' the study said.
   ``Youths in the 20s are living at home measurably longer; since
1970, they have been delaying marriage to significantly later ages;
and since 1980, they have found their average earnings declining
while those of older workers have increased.''
   Among the findings:
   _ The share of youth aged 18 to 24 who lived with their parents
or in college dormitories rose from 43 percent in 1960 to 53.6
percent in 1985.
   _ The number of first marriages per 1,000 never-married women
aged 20 to 24 fell from 220.1 in 1970 to 104.4 in 1984.
   _ Median income for women aged 20 to 24 fell from $12,517 in
1980 to $12,192 in 1986, using constant 1986 dollars. The
comparable figures for young men fell from $16,113 in 1970 to
$14,152 in 1986.
   The study said the trends may be related, since ``late marriage
is a reasonable response to lower earnings; living with parents is
a reasonable arrangement for those not earning enough to support
themselves.''
   Finn said the report also showed falling scores on college
entrance examinations and a last-place ranking for U.S. students in
recent international science and mathematics tests, raising concern
about how the youth will fare in the future.
   ``Compared to kids elsewhere in the world they are performing
poorly on all kinds of tests and that makes me worry,'' he said.
``They make me worry about the future of a country that's raising
up people with a number of years in school but that don't know
anything.''

<HEAD>Chief Ideologist's Spouse Criticizes Soviet Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Current Soviet culture is
``chaotic'' and the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
resemble those in Czechoslovakia before the Warsaw Pact invasion of
1968, a Czechoslovak educator has written.
   Eva Fojtikova, head of the Russian Department at Prague's
Charles University and the wife of the Czechoslovak Communist
Party's chief ideologist, Jan Fojtik, took a critical view of
current Soviet reforms in an article published Friday in the
cultural weekly Kmen.
   Her views of Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness on
selected subjects, come at a time when Czechoslovakia is trying to
find its own way toward greater openness, democracy and economic
restructuring.
   Fojtik, who was elected full member of the ruling Politburo in
April, is expected to chair a Communist Party plenary session on
ideology sometime next month.
   ``The present state of Soviet culture is very chaotic,'' said
the article by Mrs. Fojtikova. ``There is a marked effort of
newspaper journalism to suppress moderate opinions, all efforts to
guard and not betray the indisputable values created as a result of
the revolution and Socialist construction.''
   She added, ``It is not progress to substitute one cult lie with
another lie, another one-sidedness. With all due criticism of
(Soviet dictator Josef) Stalin, let us not forget that the cult is
not created by one person alone ...''
   Stalin's brutal regime has come under sharply increased public
condemnation under Gorbachev.
   ``We know from experience that idols are knocked down, mostly to
make room for new idols,'' the article said.
   The article also drew an apparent parallel between
Czechoslovakia prior to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion and the Soviet
Union today. Warsaw Pact forces invaded Czechoslovakia after a
series of reforms that came to known as the ``Prague Spring.''
   ``It is not possible to forget that in the Soviet Union people
did not live through a period of Hungarian, Czechoslovak or Polish
counterrevolution ... and have no direct experience with it.
Therefore, many illusions persist and (all) the greater is the
danger.''

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Two more members of the Peasants
Movement of Papaye have been arrested in the town of Hinchi and are
being held in the local army barracks, Radio Haiti-Inter reported
Monday.
   It said the two were arrested Sunday after they refused to pay
the tax that the town requires to sell goods in the marketplace.
Some members of the Peasants Movement have declared they will not
pay the tax until the market is provided with sanitary facilities.
   Eight members of the Peasants Movement were arrested Friday in
Hinche, 80 miles northeast of Port-au-Prince, and nearby Abriots
and accused of subversive activities, according to Radio
Haiti-Inter. It said they were released Monday ``on good
behavior,'' but they were bruised and bloody.
   The broadcast also said that officials of Haiti's military
government on Monday questioned Chavannes Jean-Baptiste, founder of
the Peasants Movement of Papaye, for five hours at the Hinche army
barracks.
   Jean-Baptiste, regional director of Caritas, a Roman Catholic
aid organization, was briefly detained by military authorities in
Hinche Saturday and told to appear at the barracks Monday.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said the officials wanted Jean-Baptiste to
allow government authorities to attend all meetings of the Peasants
Movement and it reported he refused.
   The movement is an association of peasants' groups in the
Central Plateau Department and was organized to establish
cooperatives and self-help projects.

   Doubling the distribution of ``The Last
Temptation of Christ'' didn't translate into double ticket sales
for co-distributor Universal Pictures, according to weekend
box-office figures.
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' was shown to moviegoers in
Canada and the United States this past weekend on 18 screens, with
a box-office gross of $476,623, or $26,459 per theater.
   That compared to last week's $44,579 per screen for a three-day
total of $401,211 on nine screens.
   Christian groups have demonstrated against the movie, threatened
to boycott Universal Pictures and parent company MCA Inc., and
offered to buy the movie and destroy it.
   In the most controversial scene, Willem Dafoe as Jesus
hallucinates that he comes down from the cross and has sex with
Mary Magdalene. But the movie concludes with Jesus not succumbing
to this last temptation of giving up his divinity, and he dies on
the cross.
   In Athens on Monday, the Greek Orthodox Church said it has
called for a ban on ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' in Greece,
claiming its interpretation of the life of Jesus is ``horrifyingly
vulgar.''
   Archbishop Seraphim of Athens, the Orthodox Church leader in
Greece, sent a letter to the government saying Martin Scorsese's
film would ``clash directly with the religious sensitivities of our
people.''
   ``The film attempts a horrifyingly vulgar representation of the
person of the founder of the Christian faith,'' the letter said.
   Scorsese's film is based on a novel by Greek author Nikos
Kazantzakis, who was threatened with excommunication by the
Orthodox Church when the book came out in 1954.
   The film is expected to be released in Greece next month,
according to a spokesman for United International Pictures, the
distributor.

<TEXT>
   Hans Gunther Adler, a scholar and German-language
author who wrote about his life in Nazi concentration camps, has
died at the age of 78.
   He died Sunday of heart failure at the Mead Bank Nursing Home in
Battersea after a long illness, his son, Jeremy, said.
   Born in Prague on July 2, 1910, Adler studied at Prague's German
University from 1930-35 and worked at an educational institute,
becoming a poet.
   He tried to emigrate in 1938, but plans fell through and he
remained in Czechoslovakia, one of the last of the Prague
German-Jewish writers.
   In 1941, he was picked up by the Nazis and spent several months
in forced labor on a railway in Bohemia. He returned to Prague but
was deported on Feb. 8, 1942, with his wife, Gertrud Klepetar, to
the Theresienstadt concentration camp.
   Adler spent more than three years in various concentration camps
including Auschwitz, where his wife died in the gas chamber.
   After the war, he returned to Prague where he taught survivors
of the camps and built up Prague's Jewish Museum. He emigrated to
London in 1947, married sculptor Bettina Gross, and resumed his
studies and writing.
   He won the Leo Baeck Prize, a major Jewish award, in 1958 for
his first major book ``Theresienstadt 1941-45.'' In 1969, he won
Switzerland's Charles Veillon Prize for his novel ``Panorama.''
   He also served as president of the P.E.N. Center German Language
Authors Abroad, founded by German exile writers from the Nazi era.
   Besides his son, he is survived by his second wife.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, wearing a cross of
twigs given by farm labor leader Cesar Chavez, entered the second
day of a three-day fast Monday by urging consumers and grocers to
boycott California table grapes.
   ``Children are dying in clusters of cancer,'' Jackson said at a
protest rally in front of a supermarket here.
   ``We can stop buying grapes but we can't bring back the
children,'' he said.
   Thirteen children have been diagnosed with cancer in the farming
community of McFarland, 125 miles northwest of here. The United
Farm Workers is calling for a ban on five pesticides used on
grapes, claiming they cause cancer.
   State and federal health and agricultural officials have not
pinpointed the cause of the cancer cases and tests on grapes so far
have not yielded any conclusive link.
   Jackson began his fast Sunday during an outdoor Roman Catholic
Mass in Delano, as farm workers union president Chavez ended a
36-day hunger strike.
   The former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination
said he would pass the cross, which he wore on a chain around his
neck, to the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, on Wednesday in Chicago.
   Lowery is scheduled to turn the cross over to actor Robert Blake
Saturday in Washington during the 25th anniversary celebration of
the civil rights march on the capitol.
   ``The fast will and must continue,'' Jackson said to about 75
mostly Hispanic protesters marching and chanting ``No Mas Uvas (No
More Grapes).''
   When asked how he was feeling after not eating for 24 hours,
Jackson said: ``I may become weaker physically but stronger
morally.''
   A grape growers spokesman who attended the rally called the
boycott a front for the union's political aims of signing growers
to contracts.
   ``The same pesticides are being used on other produce, but the
union doesn't complain because the other growers have union
contracts,'' said Adam Ortega, a representative of the Grape
Workers and Farmers Coalition.

<TEXT>
   An inmate walked away from a work detail
Monday and fled in a chauffered limousine before being captured a
few hours later at a luxury hotel in Albuquerque, a state
Corrections Department spokesman said.
   Derrick Stillwell, 21, serving an 18-month sentence at the
Penitentiary of New Mexico for fraud, was among seven inmates
assigned to a work detail at the state Highway and Transportation
Department, said Corrections spokesman Kevin Jackson.
   One correctional officer was assigned to the detail, Jackson
said.
   Stillwell walked away from the detail at midmorning and was seen
getting into a late-model limousine that pulled up in front of the
highway department headquarters in Santa Fe.
   ``The driver (of the limousine) had no inkling he was an
inmate,'' Jackson said. ``I believe the driver thought it was a
business-as-usual pickup.''
   Corrections official traced the limousine and contacted the
driver, Phillip L. Pacheco, Monday afternoon. Pacheco said he made
a brief stop for Stillwell at a home in Albuquerque before dropping
him off at the airport at about 12:10 p.m.
   Dan Taylor, spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said
late Monday afternoon that Albuquerque police recaptured Stillwell
at the AMFAC Hotel near the airport.
   The limousine had been reserved Sunday and paid for with a
credit card by a person identifying himself as Gregory Stephens,
Jackson said. The caller said he wanted the car to pick up his son,
Bruce, he said.
   The limousine driver told authorities that his passenger
mentioned he was going to catch a flight to Los Angeles and then go
to Seattle, Jackson said.
   ``We believe there might have been tickets left at the
airport,'' Jackson said.
   Stillwell, a New York City native, had entered the prison in May
and, with time off for good behavior, was scheduled for release in
December.

   Six Nicaraguan exiles staged a
peaceful protest against the Nicaraguan government Monday inside
their country's embassy here until they were removed by Salvadoran
riot troops.
   The six men represented a group called the United Front of
Mestizos of the Nicaraguan Atlantic Coast and demonstrated for
about an hour and a half.
   They said they were protesting what they called the leftist
Sandinista government's failure to fulfill a year-old regional
peace accord.
   Among other measures, the treaty commits Central American
governments to democratize and negotiate peaceful solutions to
insurgencies.
   The demonstrators also distributed a leaflet calling for the
release of about 40 opposition leaders jailed in Nicaragua since
July.
   Thousands of Miskito, Rama and Sumo Indians began leaving their
tribal homelands along Nicaragua's Atlantic coast in 1981 after the
government tried to move them into relocation camps.
   Many fled to Honduras. Others joined U.S.-supported Indian rebel
movements.
   Over the past year, the Sandinistas reached agreements with most
rebel movements to lay down their arms, and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees said most Indians returned to the
75-mile-long Atlantic seaboard.

   RIAS, a jointly funded U.S.-West German radio
station began regular television transmissions Monday, modernizing
its 42-year-old broadcast service that is aimed at millions of
listeners in West Berlin and East Germany.
   RIAS has made regular radio broadcasts since it was founded by
American military authorities in February 1946.
   Rundfunk is the German language word for broadcasting or radio
and RIAS is an acronym for Rundfunk in the American sector.
   Monday's first regular TV program, ``Tagesaktuell'' or ``Days'
Actual Events,'' began at 5:50 p.m. and ended after about 40
minutes of current news and information.
   Included were reports on the U.S. presidential race, labor
unrest in Poland, and cultural and other local events in Berlin.
   The new program is due to continue on a daily basis. Plans call
for RIAS television to expand its broadcasting on Oct. 3.
   RIAS officials say about 2 million West Berliners and an
additional 4 million viewers in East Berlin and East German
territory surrounding the city will be able to receive the
television broadcasts.

<HEAD>Dissident Miners Sue Union For $1 Billion</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds two grafs of background</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of miners filed a $1 billion
lawsuit Monday against the United Mine Workers and its leadership,
charging that the miners were prevented from recovering wages lost
during a 3{-year strike.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, contended that the
union did not represent them properly and discriminated against
them because they refused to take part in picket-line violence.
   Defendants included UMW President Rich Trumka, his vice
president, Cecil Roberts, and secretary-treasurer John Banovick.
The suit accused them of conspiring to keep the 406 plaintiffs from
collecting benefits to which they should have been entitled.
   In Washington, D.C., union spokesman Joseph Corcoran said late
Monday that the union's legal department had not yet seen the
lawsuit.
   But Corcoran said, ``The union is very confident that that
settlement will be upheld in any court.''
   Jerry Hammond, a spokesman for the so-called ``Forgotten 400,''
said the suit stemmed from an agreement reached in May between the
UMW and two A.T. Massey Coal Co. subsidiaries to end selective
strikes launched against two eastern Kentucky mines in 1984.
   The agreement, requiring payment of $4.47 million to the union,
also settled a lawsuit challenging Massey's decision to turn the
Leslie and McInnes mines at Sidney, Ky., into non-union operations.
   About 700 miners, including Hammond, worked at the two mines
until February 1983 when all but a maintenance crew were laid off.
The remaining miners lost their jobs Sept. 30, 1984, the day before
the two mines were sold to Sidney Coal Co., a subsidiary of Ora Mae
Coal Co., an operation owned by Massey.
   After the agreement was announced, Roberts said the $4.47
million for lost wages and benefits would be divided among some 250
miners, who had been on selective strikes, with each receiving
about $18,000.
   Hammond said the lawsuit contends that the UMW breached its duty
of fair representation by limiting the number of members who would
receive payments. The plaintiffs also contend they have been
excluded from union meetings, thus violating the organization's
constitution.
   The lawsuit asks for a jury trial, plus $500 million in
compensatory and $500 million in punitive damages.
   Trumka pushed for the union's use of selective strikes, and on
Oct. 1, 1984 Massey Coal Co. became the first target after the
company refused to sign the union's national coal wage contract.
Signing would have given Massey's laid-off employees companywide
re-employment rights.
   The union finally called off the sometimes violent strike in
December 1985 when Massey agreed to settlement of an unfair labor
practice charge, but selective strikes against the two subsidiaries
continued until May.

<HEAD>Eurotunnel Confirms Delays in Channel Tunnel Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium set up to
build a 31-mile rail tunnel between France and Britain, confirmed
on Monday that the project is running well behind schedule.
   Eurotunnel issued a formal warning to Transmanche-Link about its
likely failure to meet several constuction targets.
Transmanche-Link is a joint venture of British and French
construction companies which has the contract to design and build
the tunnel by May 1993.
   Transmanche-Link declined to comment on the delays in the tunnel
project.
   Eurotunnel warned that Transmanche-Link could face fines if it
does not speed up the rate of tunneling.
   A Eurotunnel spokesman, who was not identified, in accordance
with British custom, said Transmanche-Link is ``not yet managing
the tunneling program to our satisfaction.''
   Tunneling on the British side is at about half the rate targeted
in the contract, Eurotunnel said.
   Transmanche-Link has bored only 1.1 miles of one tunnel, against
the 2.4 miles due by early last week. The link is to have three
tunnels.
   The rate of tunneling is running at about 380 feet a week,
compared with a target of 660 feet a week.
   Tunneling on the French side also is behind schedule, Eurotunnel
said.
   Project delays could affect banks' willingness to inject funds
into the project, said Richard Hannah, an analyst at the brokerage
Phillips and Drew.
   So far, the tunnel work has been financed with funds raised
through the sale of $1.3 billion worth of stock in the consortium.
Once those funds have been exhausted, Eurotunnel can draw on an
$8.5 billion loan signed last November with a syndicate of
commercial banks.
   But the banks have to be satisfied that sufficient progress on
the project has been made before they commit any money, Hannah said.
   ``They will have a very hard look at the project before putting
any money in,'' he added.
   The first drawdown of the bank financing is due in October,
Hannah said.
   Eurotunnel units, which are made up of one share in Eurotunnel
PLC and one in Eurotunnel S.A., were off 12 pence (20 cents) at 313
pence ($5.29) on London's Stock Exchange by late Monday afternoon.

<TEXT>
   A leftist coalition whose
leaders are linked to Marxist-led guerrillas announced Monday it
will participate in the March presidential elections.
   Leftist parties have boycotted elections since civil war began
in late 1979. They said their security could not be guaranteed and
that elections formed part of a U.S.-directed counterinsurgency
plan.
   In the past, the Christian Democratic government of President
Jose Napoleon Duarte has invited leftist political leaders to
participate in elections but asked the guerrillas to lay down their
arms.
   The Democratic Convergence, a coalition of three left-of-center
parties, said Monday it will choose its candidates in coming weeks.
   The coalition includes the National Revolutionary Movement, the
Popular Social Christian Movement and the Social Democratic Party.
   Guillermo Ungo, leader of the National Revolutionary Movement,
and Ruben Zamora, chief of the Popular Social Christian Movement,
are the president and vice-president, respectively, of the
Democratic Revolutionary Front.
   The front forms a civilian-military alliance with the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla army battling the
U.S.-backed government.
   An estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
civil war.
   The guerrillas condemned previous elections as farces, but
leftist civilian politicians recently said guerrilla leaders
understand their decision to take part in the March elections.
   ``Our objective in the electoral process is the promotion of a
political and negotiated solution to the armed conflict as an
indispensable condition for fulfilling the Salvadoran people's most
pressing demands,'' a communique issued by the Convergence said.
   ``The upcoming elections will not in themselves resolve the
fundamental problems of our society ... but we are convinced that
our participation will bind and mobilize people around the
objectives of social justice, democracy, national independence and
peace.''
   The election is likely to be a close contest between El
Salvador's two dominant parties, the incumbent Christian Democrats
and the conservative Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   The alliance, known as Arena, gained control of the legislature
and two-thirds of the country's municipal governments in elections
held in March.
   Duarte has been diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer.

<TEXT>
   Faced with a third straight summer of
low rainfall, officials ordered most of the town's 4,500 residents
and businesses to cut water use by 20 percent Monday.
   ``The gut of the problem is we haven't gotten any rain,'' City
Manager Ben Shivar told a news conference. ``If we had gotten the
kind of showers that fell this weekend in Sanford and Greensboro,
we would have substantially reduced our problem,'' Shivar said
referring to two other central North Carolina cities.
   The main reservoir supplying this town 50 miles west of Raleigh
is more than six feet below its normal level, reducing the
available water supply to about 44 percent of normal, Shivar said.
   If customers continue to use water at the current rate of about
2.2 million gallons a day without substantial rainfall, the city
could run out of water in about 41 days, Shivar said.
   Mayor Earl B. Fitts' order Monday mandates a water allocation
system requiring residents and most businesses to cut water use by
20 percent immediately. The order requires two large poultry
producers _ Townsend Foods and Mid-State Farms _ to reduce water
consumption by 30 percent.
   Shivar said the two poultry companies, which employ about 500
people, use about 42 percent of the city's water supply.
   Voluntary conservation measures have reduced daily consumption
to just less than 2.2 million gallons from about 2.47 million
gallons, Shivar said. Monday's order is designed to reduce daily
usage by an additional 300,000 gallons. Anyone found violating the
order a third time could be penalized with fines and termination of
service.
   Residents could face stricter restrictions in the coming weeks
unless consumers cooperate, Shivar said.
   ``We might not be able to avoid layoffs,'' he said. So far, no
businesses have had to cut back on production because of the water
crisis, he added.

   Vice President George Bush on Monday defended his besieged
running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, as a patriot who served honorably in
the National Guard and at least ``did not go to Canada'' to avoid
the Vietnam War.
   And Quayle told a veterans group in a hastily arranged speech
that he pulled no strings to get into the Indiana National Guard
because his unit ``had openings before I applied, they had openings
when I applied, and they had openings after I applied.''
   ``My national guard unit was never called up to active duty, but
let me say that after these last 72 hours no one can say I've never
faced combat,'' Quayle told 2,500 whistling and cheering members of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   Bush spoke earlier to the VFW convention in Chicago, strongly
defending his running mate. He said after his appearance that he
wants to speak out for Quayle because ``I want to get that
(campaign) focus where it belongs, which is Bush-Dukakis, and
that's what I tried to do.''
   The Republican National Convention boosted Bush to a narrow lead
over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, 46-40, according to a CBS
News poll released Monday. The same poll, however, revealed serious
reservations about the Quayle choice as a running mate.
   Half the respondents in the survey said they did not believe
Quayle has the experience to be a good president, and another 28
percent were unsure. Thirty-nine percent said they wished Bush
chose someone else.
   The poll of 1,221 registered voters was conducted Friday through
Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus three points.
   Dukakis, campaigning in Massachusetts before an evening national
security briefing, referred to the Quayle controversy in the
context of who Americans would want to be ``a heartbeat away from
the presidency'' _ Democrat Lloyd Bentsen or Quayle.
   Bush, in his speech, recalled his own record as a bomber pilot
in World War II and said he had strong feelings for those who
``fought in the rice paddies'' of Vietnam.
   ``I hardly ever walk by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in
Washington when I don't get a lump in my throat or a tear in my
eye,'' he said. ``But many others served, too, some in the Army
Reserve, some in the National Guard _ people who were not sent
overseas,'' like Quayle.
   ``True, he didn't go to Vietnam, but his unit wasn't sent,''
Bush said. ``But there's another truth: He did not go to Canada, he
did not burn his draft card and he damned sure didn't burn the
American flag. And I'm proud to have him at my side.''
   The vice president said his running mate was the victim of
``shrill, partisan attack.'' He also charged Dukakis with wanting
``unilateral cuts in our defense.''
   If the United States had embraced the nuclear freeze movement,
as Dukakis had, ``it would have locked in Soviet superiority in a
range of strategic areas,'' he said.
   Dukakis told reporters in Lowell, Mass., that Quayle's
qualifications ``obviously'' would be an issue to voters.
   ``How we make our decisions, how we make the presidential
selections, who we select ... whether or not that person should be
a heartbeat away from the presidency, obviously will be an an issue
in the campaign,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democrats' national security briefing was being given by CIA
Director William Webster and was secret, said Bentsen campaign
spokesman Mike McCurry. The agency traditionally offers the
briefing in every presidential campaign, he said.
   Quayle appeared on some early morning television shows and later
invited the press to take photographs in his office, where he was
asked if he was going to remain on the ticket.
   ``I'm George Bush's running mate,'' he responded. The flap about
his National Guard service would ``get behind us,'' he said.
   In his television interviews, he reasserted that ``no rules were
broken'' to get him into the guard when he joined in Indiana in
1969.
   ``I got into the National Guard fair and square, and I don't
believe anybody is alleging anything differently,'' he said on
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``But somehow this whole National Guard episode is being
perceived that joining the National Guard is something less than
patriotic, and I really take strong exception to that,'' he said.
   President Reagan was vacationing in California, where spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater declined to comment on Quayle's National Guard
service.
   Asked whether the president believed Quayle should be dropped
from the ticket, Fitzwater said: ``It is not a relevant question.''
   ``Senator Quayle is the vice presidential candidate and he's a
good one,'' he said.
   The spokesman said Reagan planned to make between eight and 15
appearances ``all around the country'' on behalf of the ticket. The
president would ``draw distinctions between liberals and
conservatives, between Democrats and Republicans,'' he said.
   In Illinois, House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said he
thought it was too early to discuss dropping Quayle from the ticket.
   ``If there was something additional that came up that was a
distraction or a disqualification, well, the option's always
there,'' he said. ``But I don't see it at this juncture.''
   ``I'm not going to call it a mistake yet,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter on
Monday denied charges that Panamanian forces are harassing U.S.
military personnel, calling the allegations an escalation of a
campaign to undermine the government.
   Ritter told a news conference U.S. officials who accused the
government of encouraging attacks on Americans were seeking ``an
excuse ... (for) new and more aggressive measures against Panama.''
   U.S. officials in Panama said Sunday that American personnel
reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by Panamanian
officials this year, ranging from extortion for traffic violations
to the blocking of mail.
   The Panama Defense Forces rejected the allegations Sunday night
and said in a statement that American troops caused problems for
Panamanian authorities, including fights, mistreatment of women and
shooting in public places.
   The Reagan administration has applied economic sanctions against
Panama in an effort to force the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, commander of the Defense Forces and the country's de facto
ruler.
   Noriega is under U.S. indictment in Florida on drug trafficking
and money laundering charges, which he denies.
   Ritter said Monday American officials made the allegations to
make it appear that ``the (U.S.) aggressors become the victims.''
   He reiterated Panamanian charges that the United States was
seeking a pretext to annul the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, under
which the United States is to hand over control of the canal to
Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Col. Rogelio Alba, co-president of a bi-national committee
charged with the defense of the Panama Canal, said that U.S.
Southern Command officials ``have shown a lack of respect in all
things for us.''
   Alba said, ``We've gone out of the way to collaborate with them.
We've never interfered with them, and they're killing us with
hunger.'' _ referring to the U.S. economic sanctions that have
crippled Panama's economy.
   The New York Times on Sunday quoted U.S. Southern Command, State
Department and Defense Department officials as saying there have
been an increasing number of beatings, abductions, rape and
extortion of U.S. military personnel and their dependents.
   The story, under a Washington dateline, said the U.S. officials
viewed the incidents as a campaign by the Panamanian government to
pressure the United States to lift sanctions.
   But one Southern Command official said Sunday the increased
reports of harassment ``could be just an indication of individual
frustration and anger.''
   Washington imposed economic sanctions on Panama in March after
the Noriega ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle. Delvalle has
since been in hiding, but the United States continues to recognize
him as Panama's legitimate president.
   About 12,000 U.S. servicemen are stationed in Panama by treaty
to protect the Panama Canal. They are attached to the Southern
Command, which oversees all U.S. military operations south of the
U.S.-Mexico border.

<TEXT>
   An explosion and fire at the
pharmaceutical laboratory associated with Diet Center stores Monday
sent clouds of smoke through this eastern Idaho town, forcing the
evacuation of a four-block-wide area.
   The blast occurred about 3 p.m. in the research and development
laboratories at Ferguson Pharmaceutical while employees were on a
break. No injuries were reported, said Ross Mayfield, operations
director for the state Bureau of Disaster Services.
   Residents and businesses within a two-block radius were
evacuated, along with pupils and employees at a nearby elementary
school, where classes were just ending.
   Most of the materials in the laboratory involved vitamins and
diet supplements manufactured for the company's 2,300 Diet Center
franchises in the United States and Canada, Mayfield said.
   Authorities warned residents, however, that the smoke could
contain toxic elements. Mayfield said this was because the fire
burned plastic containers, releasing hazardous gases.
   About 120 employees worked in the laboratories, said Roger
Ferguson, co-founder of the Diet Centers with his wife, Sybil. The
company had about a 60-day supply of stock in another building,
said his son, Mike Ferguson.
   The fire was expected to burn through the night, said Doug Call,
chief of the Idaho Falls Fire Department, which was called for
assistance.
   The cause of the blast remained undetermined late Monday.

   A chartered jet carrying about 80 reporters
covering Republican presidential nominee George Bush was forced to
dump fuel Monday and return to O'Hare International Airport,
officials said.
   ``It's taxiing to the terminal. There were no reports of
injuries,'' said a supervisor at the O'Hare tower who would not be
identified by name.
   He said the Boeing 727 landed without incident at 2:48 p.m. CDT.
He was uncertain how far out of Chicago the aircraft was when it
developed problems.
   ``They took off and they had a bad flap indicator,'' said Mort
Edelstein, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The reporters had covered the vice president's campaign stop in
Chicago, and were flying to Bush's next campaign stop at Spokane,
Wash., authorities said.
   Edelstein said the decision to dump fuel while the plane circled
over Lake Michigan preparing for an approach to O'Hare was routine.
   ``It's a precaution. When you make an emegency landing you don't
want to come in loaded, heavy with fuel,'' Edelstein said.
   The plane was chartered from Key Air, based in Rosslyn, Va.,
said Missy Compton, a spokeswoman in Bush's Washington campaign
office.
   ``It went back to Chicago. They have mechanics there in Chicago
who are going to work on the plane,'' she said.
   Key Air officials decided Monday evening to ground the plane,
and the reporters proceeded to Spokane on another aircraft,
Edelstein said.
   Key Air Vice President Scott Andrews said the flap problem was
not serious and that the plane could have flown to Spokane if the
captain had chosen to do so, though at a reduced altitude and speed.
   Andrews said the flaps on the plane's wings failed to go back to
their normal position after takeoff.
   The incident was the second malfunction in the plane in three
days, Andrews said.
   During Bush's trip to Ohio over the weekend, smoke entered the
jet's cabin as the aircraft landed at Port Columbus International
Airport. Airport officials said a hose came loose and allowed a
small amount of smoke to leak, but said the problem was minor. The
plane continued from Columbus to Cleveland on Saturday without
incident, officials said.

in the India-Nepal border region.
   The death toll was expected to climb in Sunday's pre-dawn quake,

   A broad majority of Americans favor federal
financing for Olympic training, something the government and the
U.S. Olympic Committee long have resisted, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Sixty-seven percent of the 1,223 adults polled supported federal
money for U.S. Olympic athletes, while just 27 percent were
opposed. The team receives no money from the government.
   With the Summer Games to begin in Seoul, South Korea, in three
weeks, the national survey also found sharply divided opinion on
the participation of professional athletes in some sports. A
plurality, four in 10, wanted no professionals, but nearly as many
favored allowing professionals in all Olympic sports.

   Capitol Hill lobbyists paced by a
controversial Social Security advocacy group spent more than $63.62
million trying to influence Congress in 1987.
   The amount, compiled from required reports filed with the House

massive overhaul of the nation's income tax laws spurred big
spending by registered lobbyists.
   The 1986 total of $60.87 million by some 8,500 individuals and

the highest total since The Associated Press began compiling the

   The Dan Quayle dilemma, revolving generally
around questions of inexperience and privilege, has ensnarled
George Bush at a critical moment and threatens the Republican
candidate's appeal to the ``Reagan Democrats'' who helped make him
what he is today.
   The emerging image of Quayle as an overindulged rich kid is not
so much Quayle's problem as Bush's: the issues reflect as much on
Bush's judgment in 1988 as Quayle's judgment as a 22-year-old in
1969.
   Bush would rather be talking about his ``L-word,'' the brand of
Democratic liberalism he associates with George McGovern, Jimmy
Carter, Ted Kennedy and now Michael Dukakis. But the Quayle matter
makes that practically impossible; in political terms, Bush has
lost control of the agenda.

Party officials to stand by his choice of Dan Quayle for a runing
mate despite the controversy swirling around the Indiana senator's
National Guard service and admission to law school.
   But many of those backing the Republican vice presidential
nominee qualified their support by saying it hinged on the
assumption there would be no new dislosures suggesting he
benefitted from family influence.
   Asked if he thought Bush should consider dropping Quayle, House
GOP leader Bob Michel of Illinois, said, ``If there was something
additional that came up that was a distraction or disqualification,
well, the option's always there. But I don't see it at this

   Gravediggers in northern Burundi have

said Monday.
   Government and U.N. officials in neighboring Rwanda said at

   Foreign Minister Cyprien Mbonimpa of Burundi included the first
official death toll in an official communique issued at a morning

   It also was read during the 1 p.m. newscast on government radio,
according to diplomats who spoke in telephone interviews from
Bujumbura, capital of the small, densely populated country in
Central Africa. They asked that their names not be used.
   ``It said the people in charge of burying the bodies have

that was the total dead was not unknown immediately.
   ``It appeared as if they had concluded their work, but it was

<TEXT>
   After 34 years in power, President
Alfredo Stroessner's Colorado Party is losing the loyalty of young
people. Leaders say they are concerned but not alarmed.
   The trend is most evident in the universities, although no
statistics are available to show the exact numbers of youths
leaving or refusing to join the governing party.
   Student governments that formerly were staunchly pro-Stroessner
now are dominated by coalitions that challenge the government.
Students also are forming new groups.
   ``I'm a Colorado by tradition, not conviction, because you have
to be one to work as a public employee,'' said a 20-year-old law
student who gave her name only as Maria. She added that she was
fired from a government job for voting for an opposition slate of
candidates for her student government.
   ``There is no doubt that the Colorado Party has been losing
influence among the young these days,'' said sociologist Jose
Nicolas Morinigo.
   The Paraguayan Federation of University Students, which
Education Minister Carlos Ortiz Ramirez describes as ``one more
movement of irregular opposition to the government,'' was set up
last year and comprises more than a dozen member groups.
   The Colorado Party claims 1.4 million members, most of whom are
younger than 29 and know no other president than Stroessner, who
took power by coup in 1954 and has ruled ever since. He is now 75
years old.
   The party, after the armed forces, is the strongest institution
in this rural, landlocked nation of 3.8 million people. Membership
is required for all public employees, and a prerequisite for
benefits such as government scholarships.
   Desertions by youths and challenges by those who chart an
independent course from within pose a thorny problem that Colorado
officials acknowlege they must address.
   A priority next year is ``the recovery of the diverse student
centers that are circumstantially in the hands of the opposition,''
said Mario Abdo Benitez, the party's vice president and
Stroessner's longtime private secretary.
   ``We have made mistakes, but we are trying to set them right and
give a greater dynamism to our policies with the young,'' said
Martin Chiola, a Colorado congressman who is president of the
party's Committee on Student Affairs.
   Students along with the Catholic Church have called on the
government to allow more civil rights and political liberties.
   In May, when Pope John Paul II visited Paraguay, dozens of young
people at a rally held up their arms, shackled at the wrists with
handkerchiefs, to dramatize the lack of freedoms.
   In July, students boycotted classes at Catholic University to
protest the expulsion of the Rev. Juan Antonio de la Vega, a
Spanish Jesuit priest who had lectured on Liberation Theology, a
social reform movement among clergymen.
   Thousands of youths were among the estimated 20,000 people who
in early August marched silently through the streets of the capital
in a gesture of solidarity with the Catholic Church, to which most
Paraguayans at least nominally belong.
   The Rev. Dionisio Daeshague, who helped organize 14,000 youth
volunteers for the papal visit, said dissident or independent
student groups could be ``a time bomb for the government. All they
need is someone to light the wick.''
   Party leaders are concerned, but not alarmed. Militant
Stroessner supporters won control of the party at its convention
last year. While that alienated some members, it nevertheless
demonstrated that Stroessner's power base remains strong.
   ``Some of the youth call for democracy, but I don't know what
kind of democracy they want and demand because I consider this a
democracy,'' said Zoraida Ramirez, vice president of the
government-sanctioned Colorado University Student Association.
   ``We have peace, we have progress with the government of
President Stroessner,'' said Ms. Ramirez, a 24-year-old economics
student at National University. ``One has to leave the country to
fully appreciate the peace in which we live.''

<TEXT>
   Clad in traditional Arabian robes
and headdress, Dr. Lawrence Curtis sits in his study, surrounded by
the things he loves _ an extensive zoological library, three snakes
and a scorpion that paces in a small box.
   Every so often, a curious ostrich peers through the window.
   Home for Curtis is Riyadh's zoo.
   The 58-year-old Texan was hired specially to establish a zoo in
this oil-rich nation and sometime in the future, he said, ``Saudi
Arabia may be breeding more endangered species than many advanced
countries.''
   Curtis spent 15 years as a zoo director in Fort Worth, Texas,
and another 15 in Oklahoma City.
   ``I was bored with conventional zoos,'' he said, and 18 months
ago heard that Riyadh was planning to open a zoo and needed a
director. He packed enough clothes for two weeks and headed for the
Saudi capital.
   He was hired on the spot and given just four months to prepare
for the zoo's opening in March 1987.
   Today, the Riyadh zoo is home to 1,200 animals, many of them
endangered species. It is also an oasis, carpeted in lush grass and
filled with flower beds, bubbling man-made streams, small trees,
and flowering vines thriving in the highly irrigated desert soil.
   Nearly 7,000 visitors a day pass through its gates _ men on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and veiled women on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Sundays, in accordance with Saudi Arabia's Islamic
tradition of separating the sexes.
   To Riyadh's residents, the zoo is a welcome change of scenery.
To Curtis, the zoo is much more.
   ``I really wanted our zoo to have an international reputation
for conservation,'' he said.
   One of his first tasks was to help persuade the municipality to
issue a policy statement supporting the Convention of International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), a treaty designed to protect
wild animals in their native countries.
   Saudi Arabia supports the treaty although it has yet to sign it
_ a point Curtis thinks will change soon _ but the expression of
support made it easy for him to get colleagues all over the world
to help stock the zoo.
   In keeping with CITES guidelines, no endangered species were
collected from the wild.
   An Arabian leopard and an ibex were shipped from Cincinnati's
zoo. Pigmy hippos came from the Bronx Zoo in New York City. Boston
sent antelopes. Miami, Cleveland and Duke University sent lemurs.
San Diego contributed a scimiter horned oryx, and a golden lion
marmoset came from Washington, D.C.
   The zoo in Cairo, Egypt, sent giant tortoises, the Singapore zoo
a crocodile, the Sydney zoo in Australia a kangaroo and two tapirs
arrived from the zoo in Lima, Peru.
   Bedouins, the nomads who live in Saudi Arabia's desert, brought
in lizards, a caracal and a hyena in the back of pick-up trucks.
And so it went, until the zoo's eclectic collection rivaled those
of its more established counterparts.
   ``We've got an Indian mynah who speaks Arabic, and a parrot who
speaks Swahili,'' said Curtis. ``He's next to a macaw from Brazil
and you know what they speak there (Portuguese). We really have a
multilingual zoo; it's like the United Nations.''
   Getting the animals to Riyadh was only half the chore.
   ``The big challenge was acclimatization,'' Curtis said. ``We had
to make a lot of modifications.'' Upon his arrival, he was given a
list of animals approved for acquisition but he rejected some as
inappropriate.
   A wild horse was scratched for want of adequate running space,
and several poisonous snakes were eliminated due to lack of staff
expertise in handling them. Many animals need special care in order
to thrive in Riyadh's desert climate.
   ``The key to acclimatization is spraying and misting systems, so
we installed a lot of that,'' Curtis said. The zoo also invested in
shade cloth, which cuts out 80 percent of sunlight in the summer
months, when temperatures often reach 122 degrees.
   Reptiles accustomed to high humidity are sprayed with water.
   Like his charges, Curtis seems to have adapted to his new
environment. He wears the local robes and headdress, known as a
thobe and ghutra.
   He takes frequent desert trips to study and photograph Saudi
Arabia's native fauna.
   ``This country has made remarkable progress. It has a big
commitment to conservation,'' Curtis said. ``They've already
created national parks, there's an endangered species list, and
we've got endangered species legislation coming up.''

   Have you ever bought English tea thinking that the
royal seal on the package means Queen Elizabeth II drinks it?
   Brace yourself for a disappointment if you did. The warrant
doesn't guarantee that she does. Actually, Buckingham Palace won't
say what Her Majesty prefers.
   ``Does that matter?'' asks Hugh Faulkner, secretary of the Royal
Warrant Holders Association. ``The fact that she might not drink it
is irrelevant. That tea goes into Buckingham Palace.''
   Nevertheless, the Economist magazine wrote recently, ``Such
labels could mislead the unwary for two reasons'' _ a warrant
holder can display the royal insignia on goods other than just
those it supplies to a palace, and warrants also go to companies
supplying palace staff but not the royals themselves.
   Warrants are dispensed by the queen, the queen mother, Prince
Philip or Prince Charles. The warrants entitle holders to put a
royal coat of arms on labels, letterheads, trucks and buildings,
along with the words ``by appointment'' to whichever royal has
given the warrant.
   The wording changes with the monarch.
   Royal Worcester, the maker of fine china, got its warrant from
King George III 200 years ago, and today is ``by appointment to
Queen Elizabeth II.''
   Other countries' surviving monarchs also grant warrants, and in
Britain the practice is centuries old.
   To win a warrant in Britain, a tradesman must have supplied the
royal household regularly for three years, and gotten paid by the
royal family for his goods or services, Buckingham Palace says.
   Various holders have more than one warrant, but only about a
dozen elite, including Harrod's department store, hold all four.
   Others, like Royal Worcester, take pride in the length of their
service to the queen, who grants the most warrants of the four
entitled to.
   The queen's list is studded with luxury goods makers, including
12 jewelers and eight champagne sellers. There also are bagpipe
makers, military outfitters, suppliers of venison, chimney sweeps,
shipping agents, clock makers, porcelain restorers, purveyors of
potted shrimp and sloe gin, suppliers of gold and silver lace,
insignia and embroidery, and a heraldic artist.
   There's even a seller of mopeds on the list.
   More practical are suppliers who sell eggs and plastic bags and
``installers of intruder alarms,'' something all the more necessary
since July 1982, when a London eccentric broke into the queen's
bedroom and woke her up.
   The lists do keep up with the times. They contain, for example,
more computer equipment makers than in the past.
   About 10 to 40 warrants are granted a year. They cost nothing.
   A Royal Household Tradesmen's Warrants Committee decides once a
year who should get a warrant from the queen or her son and heir,
Prince Charles, subject to royal approval, and announce the results
in the London Gazette, the government bulletin. Queen Mother
Elizabeth and Prince Philip consider applications throughout the
year.
   In olden times the granting of warrants was a more personal
affair. According to Royal Worcester, it got its warrant from
George III after he happened by the porcelain works and was
enchanted with the china.
   The products don't have to be British, but most are.
   ``There are very few outsiders,'' Faulkner said.
   British subsidiaries of foreign companies have won warrants,
including American ones, like Kellogg, IBM, Heinz, and the makers
of Johnson's wax.
   When companies lose their warrants _ because they aren't
measuring up, change hands, or the palace's needs have changed _
they are simply omitted from the published list.
   No official reason is given, and no figures are available
showing how many have been dropped.
   But, Faulkner said, ``people ... will notice.''
   Does a warrant help sales?
   ``Yes, it does,'' said a Royal Worcester spokesman.
   ``As you're aware, in this country the royal family is very
important. People do take note of it.''
   Cadbury Schweppes says it displays royal arms on chocolate bars
sold overseas.
   Faulkner said: ``Particularly in the Japanese market and
certainly in the American market, it doesn't hurt.''
   On the question of the queen's tea, Faulkner said: ``I wouldn't
make too much play of that particular angle. The lovely thing about
this is that people's imaginations can run wild. You don't want to
disappoint them.''
   Besides, he said, it's not something you'd bring up with the
queen.
   ``I think it would really be wrong, it would be bloody bad
manners to inquire ... what her personal likes and dislikes might
be.''

<HEAD>Italy Changing Criminal Code Dating Back to Mussolini</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the next year Italy will rid itself of a
criminal code enacted by Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime and
strengthened by more recent emergency laws to fight political
terrorism.
   In its place Parliament has adopted a new code and courtroom
procedures that the government hopes will reflect Italy's postwar
democracy.
   To strengthen the rights of defendants the new laws demand
judicial consent for arrest warrants, severely restrict pre-trial
detention and require prosecutors to explain charges and show their
evidence during a hearing shortly after an arrest.
   ``We are finding that the code formed in 1942 under the Fascists
does not fit Italy's new democracy after the war,'' said Riccardo
Dalla Vedova, a Rome defense lawyer who has studied the reforms.
   Under the old code some defendants awaiting trial languished in
jail for as long as six years. A prosecutor could order an arrest
and the defense would not get a look at the evidence until after
the investigation was complete, sometimes shortly before trial.
   The reforms also allow prosecutors to plea bargain, to trade
reduced charges or sentences for testimony that can convict crime
bosses and terrorist masterminds.
   Another change abolishes the verdict of ``not guilty for lack of
evidence.'' The finding is short of complete innocence and leaves a
cloud of suspicion over the defendants, such as the three Turks and
three Bulgarians acquitted of plotting to kill Pope John Paul II in
1981.
   The new code will go into force gradually between now and
October 1989.
   ``It solves the problems of pre-trial detention, which I have to
admit is one of the wickedest parts of our system,'' said Dalla
Vedova.
   The detentions began in the 1970s, when the state struggled to
subdue growing political terrorism from both the far left and right.
   ``With the kidnapping and killing of (former) Premier (Aldo)
Moro, attacks at the very heart of the state, we had to defend
ourselves,'' said Dalla Vedova.
   But while the pre-trial detention was created to cope with the
violence, lawyers and prosecutors agree that it came to be used
even for minor crimes.
   Pre-trial detention now is reserved for murder, kidnapping and
terrorism. And prosecutors must convince a judge it is necessary.
Prisoners awaiting trial can petition for their release.
   Dalla Vedova and lawyers Giorgio Cherubini and Quirino Mancini
said that in common law countries such as the United States the law
evolves by precedent, by Supreme Court decisions.
   But in Italy, changes must be written into the law because
judges are not bound by earlier high court opinions.
   ``In Italy a young judge can interpret a law in a completely
different way than the Supreme Court interpreted it just 10 days
before,'' said Dalla Vedova.
   Italian media often refer to the new code as the ``Perry Mason
System.'' But Erle Stanley Gardner's fictitious lawyer could well
be lost in Italy where more than 90 percent of the trials are heard
by a judge, not a jury.
   Still the reforms will allow Italian lawyers for the first time
to directly question and cross-examine witnesses rather than
suggesting their questions to the presiding judge.
   Prosecutors now must advise defendants of the charges and
disclose their evidence to the defense during a pre-trial hearing
within 10 days of arrest. Evidence that had been kept secret until
the end of an investigation now must be shared with the defense
during a series of other pre-trial hearings.
   The reforms also curtail the powers of investigating
magistrates, who in the past gathered evidence, determined whether
to prosecute and ordered the arrest.
   ``It is right that one changes, and the quicker the better, the
musical score for the criminal trial that is out of tune with a
state that wants to be truely democratic,'' Corrado Carnevale, a
judge with the Court of Cassation, Italy's highest criminal court,
told a recent conference on the new code.
   As crime became more complicated and sophisticated, and as the
investigations became more intricate and involved, Italy created
the ``maxi-trial,'' such as the Mafia trial in Palermo that had 476
defendants.
   It gave the government a way to deal with massive, organized
international crime.
   ``The handicap is no human mind can absorb 476 positions and
sort out all the evidence for and against,'' said Dalla Vedova.
   So now prosecutors can use plea bargaining to uncover new
evidence and to help separate the trials of the principal
defendants.
   Besides the new code, Italy has taken other measures to give its
criminal justice system the image of fairness. It has made judges
liable for damages if they make errors by intent or gross
negligence. At the urging of Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, who
considered the practice humiliating, police also have been slower
to clamp handcuffs on people they arrest.
   Another measure to be adopted will give journalists immunity
from being required to reveal sources on crime stories. And others
seek to deal with the backlog in Italian courts by depenalizing
some offenses or making them subject only to fines.

<HEAD>A Refreshing Change: Take The Long-Term View</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a refreshing change, try the long-term
economic view.
   It can relieve you of stress, improve your disposition, allow
you to appreciate simple things like a good night's sleep, and
probably put a few dollars in your pocket, too.
   While your neighbors in the game of financial survival cast
furtive glances over their shoulders, your demeanor is carefree.
Your smile and sturdy stride reflects not foolishness but
confidence in your course.
   All the bad news bounces off your hide: Interest rates, the
consumer price index, the balance of payments deficit, the budget
deficit, the decline of your particular stocks. Warnings of future
financial horrors worry you not.
   Good riddance to the daily worries; yours is the long-term view.
   Incredibly, the long-term investment view has been almost
forgotten over the past year, although experience shows it is the
only realistic way to view a portfolio. Investors have been caught,
instead, in the game of trading.
   Traders try to outguess the market. They are nearsighted, so
their view extends from a few hours to a few months. They calculate
the value of their investments daily. They can see themselves as
rich or poor in the same day.
   It is a nerve-wracking, mind-boggling, emotion-juggling
experience, made all the worse by the realization that there isn't
a thing that can be done to overcome the forces affecting the
investments. It is helplessness.
   In contrast, the long-run view requires little activity of any
sort. It is easy on the nerves. And, while assurance of profit can
never be accepted as a given, there is a very good chance the
long-term investor will win out.
   It's in the cards, so to speak. Over the long-term, economic
booms and busts cancel out each other, as do volatile swings in
stock prices. Over time, sound stocks move in line with fundamental
equity values.
   It's in the records.
   Wright Investors' Service calculated the annual rates of return
for the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock average for the
past five years, and found this:
   Dividend income of 3.7 percent and earnings growth of 8.4
percent, for an earned retuurn of 12.1 percent. Changes in the
price-earnings ratio for the 500 stocks added another 2.1 percent,
for a total retuurn of 14.2 percent.
   While five years often includes a complete cycle of bull and
bear markets, the latest five-year period is an exception. But,
tracing the periods all the way back to 1929-1934, he found the
annual return still came to 10.9 percent.
   After examining this evidence, Wright projects that over the
next five years, to June 30, 1993, we might reasonably expect an
annual average of 3.5 percent dividend return and 7.7 percent
earnings growth.
   Because current price-earnings ratios average somewhat higher
than they have over the past 40 years, Wright projected no growth
in this sector. In fact, he deducted 0.6 percent, for a total
annual return of 10.6 percent.
   These returns are averages, which means some quality stocks may
perform even better, perhaps doubling in the next five-year period.
But even if your stocks perform only to the average, you'd double
your money in seven years.
   Seven years might seem like an age to those who have been
focused on the next few weeks, but it isn't for some of the most
respected and successful investors. They know they can't outguess
the market; but they understand also that time and a growing
American economy are on their side.
   In the long-term view, what might seem mountainous obstacles get
reduced to specks. Even bear markets, terror of short-termers,are
not feared. In fact, they're considered opportunities by patient
investors.
   Gerald Perritt, editor of Investment Horizons, a newsletter,
offers this long-term advice:
   ``Do not be frightened by bear markets. On the contrary, since
they present a rare opportunity to accumulate the shares of good
companies at bargain prices you should view bear markets in a
favorable light.
   ``Remember, the only time you want stock prices to be at their
peak is the day you plan to sell. In the meantime, you should be
glad that the stock market periodically places its merchandise on
sale.''

<HEAD>Australia's Flying Doctors Still in Air after 60 Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been 60 years since Australia's
legendary Royal Flying Doctor Service took to the air in the vast,
sun-scorched interior known as the Outback.
   But these days its doctors are more likely to be treating
typically urban problems such as alcoholism, suicide and venereal
disease than loneliness and broken bones of past days.
   For doctors in the service, making a house call can mean flying
hundreds of miles.
   Australia is virtually the size of the United States. Distances
are measured in hours traveled, not miles; schoolchildren in the
arid Outback are educated over bush radio because no schools are
around for hundreds of miles.
   But no matter where a patient is, the Royal Flying Doctor
Service boasts it is never more than two hours away once a call is
made.
   Last year, the network's 34 aircraft flew 4 million miles to
transport 10,295 patients and treat 88,757 others.
   ``Now that's what you call a country practice,'' said Brian
Partridge, spokesman for the service, an organization that
crisscrosses a landscape of about 2 million of Australia's nearly 3
million square miles.
   ``We provide a standard of health care that is equivalent to
that enjoyed by people in the cities,'' said Partridge. ``People
assume that if you live in the country you are healthier. That is
not true.
   ``Alcoholism is very prevalent along with stress-related
disorders. The suicide rate is very high.''
   The service celebrated its diamond jubilee in May, still
committed to providing the ``mantle of safety'' that the Very Rev.
John Flynn, a Presbyterian missionary, envisioned when air travel
was in its infancy.
   In the beginning, the flying doctors attended women giving birth
and mended broken bones of cattlemen who fell off their horses.
   ``Now, we've also got to deal with tourists, as well as
prospectors, anthropologists, archaeologists and surveyors,''
Partridge said.
   ``We still get the old type of problems, but we're having to
attend a growing number of road accidents as well as suicide
attempts. Aborigines account for nearly half the people we treat.
Hepatitis is a big problem for them, as is VD. We never had that
before.''
   Based at 14 inland airports, the flying doctors are responsible
for some 5,000 outposts scattered across the desolate Outback,
often having to land at night on dirt strips or paddocks with just
car lights showing the way.
   The network, at its most dramatic, saves lives as well as
providing the general practitioner service that city folk are
accustomed to.
   One prime minister, the late Sir Robert Menzies, described the
service as the ``greatest single contribution to the effective
settlement of the far distant back country that we have witnessed
in our time.''
   Flynn established the service with the intent of banishing much
of the dread associated with the great loneliness of the Outback
and the fear of becoming ill in so isolated a place.
   ``The inland holds many lonely graves of people who might have
lived had they been able to receive medical help quickly,'' said
Partridge.
   The first flight was with the Queensland and Northern Territory
Aerial Service, later to become the national flag carrier, Qantas
Airways. Now the Flying Doctor Service operates separately.
   The network has become an intrinsic part of Australian folklore.
Two television series, ``A Country Practice'' and ``The Flying
Doctor,'' are huge successes here as well as in Britain, where they
also are shown.
   ``They are true to life because we vet the scripts,'' said
Partridge.
   Long ago homesteaders had to pedal a wireless to talk to their
nearest neighbor. Some still ``talk'' via bush radio but now almost
everyone is hooked up to a telephone service via satellite.
   Flynn, or ``Flynn of the Inland'' as he was known, began his
missionary work at a time when only two doctors served an area of
some 186,000 square miles in drought-prone Western Australia state
and 930,000 square miles in the Northern Territory, which is
sub-tropical.
   Today, the service maintains 34 aircraft and employs 18 doctors,
48 pilots, 54 radio operators and 22 engineers. It operates on an
annual budget of 16 million Australian dollars (almost $13
million), 10 percent of which it raises privately. The government
provides the rest.
   Similar services, based on the Australian example, operate in
Africa and Canada.
   The Australian Flying Doctor Service is unique and its
headquarters at Broken Hill in New South Wales is almost a required
stop for heads of state visiting Australia.
   Being a pilot for the service entails more than treating the
sick. Pilots must do their own refuelling, handling heavy drums at
isolated airstrips, and sometimes make emergency repairs.
   Partridge said at times pilots have landed their Beechcraft
turboprops only to smash into a kangaroo.
   ``You don't get that in the city,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cracks Appear in Finland's Left-Right Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cracks are appearing in Finland's
experimental coalition government of socialists and conservatives
after 15 months in office.
   From foreign trade issues to budget planning, the two former
rivals are finding their new partnership uncomfortable.
   The Finnish government is run by consensus and state welfare is
universally embraced. As a result, issues are low-keyed and changes
are incremental, though rhetoric can be heated. Foreign policy
direction is the responsibility of the president _ currently Mauno
Koivist _ who is elected separately from parliament members.
   The government formed in May 1987 combined the socialistic
Social Democratic Party with the Conservative Party, a moderate
market-oriented group. The two are ideological opposites and
clashes seemed inevitable from the outset.
   The latest tension was triggered by a secret government decision
to allow a Finnish company to buy enriched copper from the
multinational La Escondida concern of Chile, which has a military
government.
   Although Social Democratic Cabinet ministers had concurred in
the decision, their defense of the government was lukewarm when
word of the deal leaked out and was criticized in a petition by 70
prominent Social Democrats.
   The powerful Transport Workers' Union said it will refuse to
handle deliveries from Chile. The Central Trade Union Organization,
also controlled by the Social Democrats, said it would campaign for
a global boycott ``until democracy returns to Chile.''
   Trade and Industry Minister Ilkka Suominen, the Conservative
party chairman charged that the Social Democrats had ``distanced
themselves from the government'' and did not ``give sufficient
support to government programs.''
   In response, the Social Democratic chairman, Pertti Paasio,
assailed the government's secrecy in the matter.
   ``It was the wrong way to handle the La Escondida deal,
especially as the decision forbade government ministers to talk to
other leading politicians about the matter,'' Paasio told The
Associated Press.
   The coalition has given the Conservatives a significant role in
government for the first time since World War II. They had served
briefly and in minor posts only twice since the war.
   The Social Democrats dominated postwar politics in alliance with
the Center Party and its leader, Urho Kekkonen, who was president
for 25 years until he resigned in 1981 because of ill health. He
died Aug. 31, 1986.
   Kekkonen, who maintained friendly ties to Moscow, locked the
Conservatives out of power in deference to Soviet leaders who
objected to the party's hardline anti-Communist position and who
feared it might lead Finland away from its neutral foreign policy.
   Before the 1987 election, then-Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa, a
Social Democrat, said cooperation with the Conservatives was
``totally out of the question.''
   In the vote for the 200-member parliament, the Social Democrats
remained Finland's largest party with 56 seats, but the
Conservatives made sizeable gains by winning 53.
   A Conservative, Harri Holkeri, was named prime minister and
Sorsa became foreign minister.
   No longer outcasts at home, the Conservatives, it seems, also
have become acceptable to Moscow. They recently received their
first official invitation to the Soviet Union, and Suominen will
lead a delegation to Moscow in the autumn.
   The real test for the left-right coalition will be over the 1989
budget and a tax reform proposal aimed at trimming income tax and
public spending. The Social Democrats oppose slashing the money
underwriting state welfare in the budget, which must go to
parliament in early September.
   At a party conference in mid-August, the Conservatives vowed to
cut the maximum marginal tax rate to 40 percent at most, from the
current 51 percent on the top tax brackets. By Scandinavian
standards, where the top rate can be 75 percent, Finnish taxes are
moderate.
   The Social Democrats, while agreeing to some reforms, stress
that any changes should favor the poorer sectors of society.
   Housing, including the financing of sorely needed rental
apartments, is another bone of contention between the two partners.
   Suominen has suggested selling state-owned company shares, an
idea that he said is ``not a problem for us Conservatives, but
might cause ideological headaches within the other government
party.''
   Whether these strains will mean an early end for the coalition
is still unclear, but the political mood appears to be one of
wait-and-see.

<HEAD>Tiber Lovers Try to Turn the Tide for Rome's Polluted River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smelly sewage notwithstanding, the Tiber is having a
renaissance.
   Once the river was the lifeline of Rome. From ancient times to
just a century ago, Romans bathed, fished and washed their clothes
in it.
   Rome's unplanned development boom after World War II, however,
proved too much for the river. In 20 years, the population swelled
from 1 million to more than 3 million.
   Anyone foolish enough to swim in the Tiber risks fatal infection
from the untreated sewage that pours into it daily. Today's Romans
don't have the habit a going down to the river _ a stroll there
means sidestepping broken bottles, rats and syringes discarded by
drug addicts.
   But this summer gave Tiber lovers hope the tide is turning their
way in the battle against pollution and neglect.
   With an eye on developing tourist attractions for 1990, when
Rome hosts the World Cup soccer games, the city offered free boat
rides during July. The response was so great that the promotion was
extended into September.
   Tickets sold out for sunset cruises to the romantic setting of a
play performed at the Roman amphitheater at Ostia Antica, the
Tiber's ancient port.
   Hot, breezeless nights found young Romans playing cards and
dancing on Tiberina Island.
   ``The fish will return, there will be pleasure boats. This isn't
the Thames, but there's reason to believe the Tiber can be made
livable for flora and flauna,'' said Aurelio S. Misiti, a sanitary
engineer and professor at Rome's La Sapienza University. His
department works closely with the city on Tiber projects.
   While dictator Benito Mussolini had declared the river
contaminated and banned swimming and transport in 1924, Misiti
noted, postwar governments didn't get around to prohibiting the
dumping of sewage into it until 1976.
   ``In 1974, Rome started building the first purification plant,''
Misiti said in an interview. ``Now there are four plants, but they
can only handle a bit less than half the discharge, and that's just
talking about urban waste, not industry's, which is supposed to be
handled by the factories themselves.'' The sewage treatment program
was supposed to have been completed years ago.
   Misiti said it should be finished by 1992 and ``after that the
Tiber should return to normal.''
   Just outside the city, fisherman pull in edible catch from the
river, which begins its 251-mile course in the Etruscan Apennines.
   Paola Ruggeri of the World Wildlife Fund says the city for the
most part doesn't enforce regulations forcing factories to purify
their wastes before spilling them into the Tiber.
   Since 1982, her group has rented from the city a stretch of
riverbank and intends to keep it as a green oasis.
   Willows, poplars, even a fig tree, lean out to the water, making
that stretch look more like Mark Twain's Mississippi than a river
channeled through a noisy, traffic-plagued international city.
   ``Every week volunteers come to clean it and every week we find
a mountain of garbage,'' Ms. Ruggeri said.
   Until about a century ago, the city spilled down to the river
banks, leaving Rome vulnerable to devastating floods, roughly every
couple of hundred years.
   After many suggestions, including those of Giuseppe Garibaldi,
the unification hero, the government began walling off the Tiber
and demolishing buildings at river-level. Now pedestrians and cars
move along, at bridge-deck level, with the Tiber's murky green
waters are out of sight below.
   Earlier this year, when the city planned its annual April 21
celebrations of the legendary founding of Rome by Romulus along the
left bank of the Tiber, it hosted an exhibit about excavations done
in the last 10 years, when the river became a distinct department
within the city's Superintendency of Archaeology.
   Tourists walking along the river can see the excavation of a
three-level storehouse for jars of oil, wine and fish sauce left
dockside by barges at the ancient port near what is now Testaccio,
a blue-collar workers' neighborhood.
   ``In the past, the city lived on its river. Rome was a kind of
Venice, a Copenhagen, a London or a Paris,'' said Claudio
Mocchegiani Carpano, head of the city's underwater archaeology
department.
   ``A thousand years from now, when they dig up artifacts from the
20th century, they'll find out that the Tiber just ran through Rome
and served as a sewer,'' Carpano said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Poliomyelitis, the terror of decades ago, is a
disease everyone assumed was over and done with. Not quite. It is
staging a mysterious encore for those once afflicted. It's called
post-polio syndrome and by any name it's a particularly cruel twist
of the knife. The writer is one of thousands of ex-patients at risk.

   There is a terrorist, long believed dead, that is back on the
street again.
   It is not a person.
   It is a disease or a phantom of it. The disease is
poliomyelitis, the once dreaded infantile paralysis, which killed
and crippled adults as readily as children, despite its name.
   Polio has returned in ways not thoroughly understood, as if to
have a last laugh on those very victims it maimed 30, 40 and even
50 years ago.
   It is called post-polio syndrome or post-polio muscular atrophy.
It is most likely not a recurrence of the disease itself. It is not
fatal. It is or can be crippling. Its victims are only those who
have already had polio.
   A 43-year-old nurse in Plainfield, N.J., is now bedridden, her
post-polio working days apparently over. A schoolteacher in
Bridgewater, N.J., Joyce Houser, had lost 50 percent of the muscles
in what had been her ``good'' hand. Polio survivors who have walked
unaided for 30 years are back in braces again. Pain has returned.
   There may be 500,000 polio survivors in the United States.
Doctors have predicted that up to 25 percent of them will have some
recurrence of pain, muscle loss, or both.
   ``It is not a real cheery picture,'' says Dr. Frederick M.
Maynard of the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor.
   Mrs. Houser has organized one of some 200 groups of polio
survivors nationwide who meet to discuss the return of the malady
and educate the medical community, which has sometimes misdiagnosed
the symptoms as arthritis or aging.
   There are 15 studies nationwide into the phenomenon. One at the
National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Md. is investigating
whether the causes stem from some remnant polio virus. Others
suspect muscles that have been overloaded to compensate for missing
ones have begun giving way from overuse. There are theories that
muscle nerve cells that survived have deteriorated from overwork
and are not being replaced because polio left the system with a
depleted supply. No one is sure.
   ``We're trying to inform the public, the former patients and the
public,'' says Mrs. Houser, who persuaded Gov. Thomas Kean of New
Jersey to declare Polio Survivor Week last June.
   Polio, always insidious and indiscriminate, has left its
survivors with bodies 20 years older than their actual ages, Mrs.
Houser was told at a convention of post-polio groups in St. Louis
last year. That is why PPMA is often mistaken for evidence of aging.
   To the survivors, it is the return of a specter.
   Summer in the years before Dr. Jonas Salk introduced his polio
vaccine in 1955 was not just summer. It was the polio season.
Mothers fretted over any telltale sign of headache or sore throat
or stiffness in their children. Despite the heat, they kept the
kids away from public swimming pools. Seemingly by whim the disease
would become epidemic in scattered areas of the country.
   The summer of 1949 was such a year.
   That was the summer a friend from college and I were making a
less-than-grand tour of Europe. At one point we took a night train
from Paris to Heidelberg in Occupied Germany. Although visas were
hard to come by, the train was crowded. There was one vacant seat
on a bench in a third-class coach. Customarily we flipped for who
got the mattress in the flea-by-night hotels and inns where they
stayed. The loser got the springs. On the train the loser tried to
sleep without success amid the feet on the crowded coach. When I
got to Heidelberg, I was dog tired. More bad luck. Heidelberg was
having a polio epidemic that summer.
   Polio takes about 10 days to incubate. Ten days after Heidelberg
we were on a small ocean liner heading home. After a day of deck
tennis and a night in the ship's pub, I woke on the morrow with,
not unexpectedly, a splitting headache, stiff muscles and an
uncertain stomach. Unable to handle lunch, I went back to our cabin
to lie down in my upper bunk (tails again). Several hours later I
awoke and reached for the bunk light with my left arm. The shoulder
didn't move and hasn't since. Self-diagnosis was easy: polio.
   The legs still worked, so I set off for the sick bay.
   Polio, once it surfaces, moves swiftly. There are no wonder
drugs for it. Bulbar polio, which strikes towards the brain, can
kill in hours. Non-bulbar victims lie helplessly as random muscles
about the body cease to function, sometimes forever. The
frustration is as great as the fear. Two days after I was playing
deck tennis, I couldn't turn over in my bunk in the ship's surgery.
A few hours after that I could only wiggle my finger and my toes.
My breathing was becoming labored. A classic progression.

   The only oxygen was in possession of the ship's welding
department. It was rigged with a hose and a glass funnel to
improvise an oxygen tent. It helped a little. I fell into a fitful
dream. I was running down a large cavern with no end. In the middle
ground I saw another running figure who was also myself. I later
learned that a number of people who have skirted death have had
similar dreams.
   The case became something of a natural media event for those
pre-Salk years: youth stricken with polio in mid-Atlantic. The
victim's companion, a hero of the piece, persuaded the ship's
command that some treatment might be used other than a stiff upper
lip. New York was radioed and a polio specialist was flown to
Halifax, Nova Scotia. From there the doctor boarded a U.S. Coast
Guard cutter to rendezvous with the ship in mid-ocean where a
hurricane was blowing itself out.
   He brought a portable breathing machine with him but didn't use
it. The polio, again by whim, had gone as far as it was going to
go. He surveyed his patient and said simply: ``You'll walk again.''
   On landing I was taken to a hospital in New York that had turned
over a whole ward to victims of that summer's epidemic. My room had
three other patients, one a 33-year-old salesman in an iron lung. A
7-year-old boy in a lung was across the hall. Next door was a woman
doubly afflicted. She had polio and she was also unmarried and
pregnant. Up the hall was a sadistic teen-ager who tormented a
roommate, who could only move his hands but not his arms or legs,
by putting comic books just out of his reach. A vigilante duo, one
with legs and the other with arms, combined to push-drag an idle
litter up the hall to stop the barbarity.
   It was a case in point. Polio has no morals. The tormentor, who
had been brought in an iron lung, walked out paralysis-free seven
weeks later, having done nothing to help his rehabilitation but
whine. Others courageously worked on what muscles that remained to
them for months on end and got nowhere.
   Polio has one forgiving aspect. Paralysis is at its maximum in
the first few days during the acute phase. From there on there is
return of muscle, sometimes much, sometimes too little. This does
leave room for hope.
   The disease is an anatomy professor. Patients learn the names of
muscles they may no longer have. Biceps: the arms flexer. Triceps:
the arm straightener. Leg adductors. Pronaters. Supraspinatus.
   Knowing what muscle does or did what helps the patient weigh his
future. No biceps? Trying to hold a plate in buffet line may be an
invitation to broken crockery. Weak triceps? Pushing a heavy
revolving door won't be easy. No adductors? Say goodbye to skiing.
   The patient, as the deep and constant pain of muscle spasms
gradually subsides and twinges of motion return, can begin to think
of a longer future. This is not easy to visualize when trying to
read a newspaper flat on your back with only wriggling fingers. It
leaves you blanketed with pages like all the shrouds fit to print.
   But eventually there comes time to make a survey: Will you ever
be able to feed yourself? Open a door? Walk outside? Hold a job?
Marry and have children? Will you drown in self-pity or challenge
the world from a wheelchair? Polio can be rather instructive in the
area of self-knowledge.
   But it is the little things that are the first hurdles. Building
up enough finger strength to twist a radio dial ``on''. Enough
biceps to lift a fork. There is the rage of hopeless frustration in
trying to tie a bow tie. The newspapers have said that Sen. Robert
Dole, who lost the use of an arm from a war wound, takes 10 minutes
to button his shirt. They say he has an angry streak in him. A
polio survivor can understand.
   Gradually as movement returns _ no more predictable than it went
away _ the survivor learns new tricks. A bow tie can be tied if the
bad arm is braced against a door jamb. Revolving doors can be
mastered by waiting for someone to enter first and do most of the
shoving. The person in leg braces learns which steps in a friend's
house to avoid. Learns to swallow pride and accept a piggyback.
   If the muscles are weak, the determination for the polio
survivor seems to be as strong in inverse proportion.
   The salesman in the iron lung in the hospital in New York
eventually managed another hospital from a wheelchair. After some
months, I did walk again, just as predicted. My last pre-polio
round of golf had been 101. My first post-polio was 102. I had lost
one stroke and a number of scattered muscles. The other day I tried
to lift a box of heavy bolts off the top shelf of a ship chandlery.
The weakened triceps and the absent deltoids weren't up to it, and
the whole load cascaded over my head onto the floor.
   Well, polios from those pre-vaccine days of 30, 40 and 50 years
ago have learned if nothing else to be philosophical about the
world their limitations have left for them.
   That's why post-polio muscular atrophy after all those decades
of learning to cope seem to be a particularly cruel twist of the
knife. I don't know if it's happening to me, but I've already taken
a night train to Heidelberg. I don't want to have to go again.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ As one inmate puts it, ``If you have to go to
jail, ask for Alderson.'' That's the Federal Correctional Institute
at Alderson, W.Va., the federal government's only all-women's
prison. But if Alderson seems less harsh than most prisons, it is
still a place to be punished.

   Colonial cottages on spacious grounds and
lovely scenery greeted Liz when she arrived in West Virginia. A
matronly woman held out her arms and said, ``Come on in, sweetie.''
   Come on in, that was, to serve your 30-year sentence in the
place to be if you're in that kind of a jam. For this was Liz's
welcome to the Federal Correctional Institute at Alderson, the
federal government's only all-women's prison.
   Here, where the Greenbrier River winds among rolling hills, the
affluent come to take mineral waters, and farmers bring livestock
to market, Liz curls up on the bed in her tiny private room.
There's a fluffy pink rug. Bits of beads and ribbons are draped
around the mirror. Snapshots are pinned to the wall, reminders of
the daughters Liz left behind in far-off Texas.
   Neither Liz nor the prison will specify her offense. ``In this
place,'' says Liz, ``you can forget.''
   Not entirely.
   ``This is a prison,'' says Jean Gump, a pacifist who took a
sledgehammer to a missile silo and must spend eight years away from
her 12 children.
   The head counts, homosexuality, contraband, snitching,
inspections, guards, isolation, lack of privacy, lack of control
all are typical of prison life.
   Added to that are the absent children.
   A social worker says about 80 percent of the women at Alderson
are mothers.
   ``What happens to the children, the families of the women here,
is devastating,'' Gump says.
   Things go wrong at home. The children get into trouble. They go
to jail. Their mothers sit helpless in prison, cut off by the same
mountains that make the view so pretty.
   ``It is so heartbreaking,'' another inmate says. ``Everyone in
the visiting room starts crying. It must be the most intense
torture there is _ the intense pain of being emotionally helpless.''
   Liz's daughters are growing into strangers. She copes, she says,
by not thinking about it.
   ``You can't be a mother. You try to be a friend,'' says Dora
Brown, serving life for murder.
   Brown's husband ran off with a younger woman and left her three
sons to fend for themselves. They lasted a month before they got
into trouble and two were made wards of the state. She has seen
them twice in the past year.
   Sometimes there is sisterhood.
   ``You'll see it in people that you think, `My God, they're so
violent, they're so cold, they're so everything.' All of a sudden
this one woman is going to have a need and then the goofy one you
think is so nuts responds,'' Gump says.
   ``It is so good. It is just so good. You can't count on it, but
it manifests itself.''
   But mostly the women shut their turmoil inside. If they didn't,
Brown says, ``it would be a mess around here.''
   Easygoing as life is in Alderson, compared with other prisons,
temptation to escape remains. Charles Manson disciple Lynette
``Squeaky'' Fromme escaped last Christmas, when she thought her
cult guru, also in prison, had cancer and ``I just had to get
out.'' She was captured after three days. Fromme was sentenced in
an assassination attempt on then-President Gerald Ford.
   Another inmate fled in the winter of 1984 to reach the bedside
of her ailing father. Her frozen body was found in an abandoned
feed store about a mile from the prison six weeks later.
   Alderson's warden is Ronald Burkhart. At some federal prisons,
he says, you can cut the tension with a knife.
   ``Here, the tone is more relaxed,'' he says. ``I don't want it
to be tense.''
   He's speaking in his office on a humid, 90-degree day, hotter
inside. The warden has his tie knotted, his suit coat on and the
air conditioner off. He looks comfortable.
   Burkhart plays it cool. Eighteen prisoners escaped the year he
arrived, 1984; five fled last year and only one so far this year.
``Our first wall is our staff,'' he says. ``Friendly but not
familiar.'' More relaxed inmates means fewer escapes.
   When nuclear disarmament radical Helen Woodson tried to
``escape'' in March, she hung an ``end war'' banner on the prison
fence, walked through the outer gate and poured white paint on the
parking lot.
   Guards marched her back in. The warden stayed calm.
   ``She said, `I escaped, didn't I?' And I said, `No, you
didn't,''' Burkhart says.

   Security at Alderson is not oppressive. On the grounds, maximum
security murderers, some holding hands, are chatting with
minimum-security embezzlers beneath majestic oaks.
   The only gun visible is one carried by a guard who patrols the
159-acre penitentiary's perimeter, walking along a chain-link fence
that doesn't always keep neighborhood dogs out.
   Beyond, however, are the mountains and miles and miles of woods,
which make a stroll to freedom much less inviting.
   The isolation that keeps prisoners in also keeps their families
out.
   ``The remoteness is a real barrier,'' says John Vodicka, who
with his wife runs a hospitality house for what few inmate
relatives make the journey to this rural corner of West Virginia,
where Greenbrier, Summers and Monroe counties meet.
   Amtrak pulls through Alderson, about a mile down the road from
the prison, three times a week. A van brings families from
Washington, D.C., twice a month. The only other way is by car.
   Last Thanksgiving, Vodicka says, only some 65 of the 812 inmates
received visitors.
   The geographic isolation grates. Alderson's inmate population is
45 percent black and 24 percent Hispanic. More than 150 inmates are
Colombians, and many of the women don't speak English. Most are
from big cities.
   Their relatives often find the Alderson environment _ rural and
95 percent white _ puzzling.
   It's a tolerant town, however, one of those rare communities
that actually wanted the prison to be built there and donated land
for it. ``I've been really impressed with how friendly Alderson
is,'' say Vodicka's wife, Dee.
   Inmates, in fact, march in Alderson's holiday parade. They
provide fire protection, too; the prison runs the nation's only
all-female firefighting force. Competition is keen among inmates
for the tough training required, in part because they then live in
a cottage set aside for the firefighters and emergency medical
technicians.
   The women take special delight in telling about the time they
arrived at the scene of a car accident and treated the injured
child of a prison guard.
   In this rather unusual coexistence, town folk don't worry when
the prison whistle sounds an occasional escape alert.
   ``You just about expect it,'' says a waitress at the Alderson
Livestock Market's coffee bar. ``Mostly I never think about it. If
it were men, you'd think of more hardened criminals. If a man
escapes, you have to watch for it. But women...''
   Among the better-known prisoners at Alderson have been Tokyo
Rose and Axis Sally, serving time for their World War II activities
in behalf of the nation's enemies. Singer Billie Holiday was there
once on a drug conviction.
   No prison is wholly trouble free. In 1979, inmates complained of
mistreatment by guards and inadequate health care. One woman told a
civil rights task force that prison doctors didn't discover her
pregnancy until she gave birth to twins, one alive and one
stillborn.
   In 1982, Haitian refugees _ held there while the federal
government tried to figure out what to do with them _ waged a
hunger strike and two were force-fed.
   Lesbianism is said to be widespread, but as one former warden
noted, ``Homosexuality in a women's institution doesn't take the
same (violent) form it often does in a male facility.''
   Alderson was unusual from its beginnings in 1927. Inmates in
white gloves served tea and presented plays under the first warden,
Superintendent Mary B. Harris, who once taught Latin at a girl's
finishing school in Chicago. In typical style she posed for her
warden's portrait in pearls, fur stole and white, elbow-high gloves.
   When the modern Alderson staged a show in 1981, it appeared on
TV's ``The Games People Play,'' with inmates and staff competing
over an obstacle course and criminal lawyer F. Lee Bailey serving
as the commentator.
   Despite Alderson's relative sedateness, there are violent
prisoners there, and for such hard-core inmates the end of life
there is approaching. The Bureau of Prisons is creating a second
all-women penitentiary in Lexington, Ky., where violent-prone
offenders will be housed in an underground complex. Alderson will
be converted to a ``camp.''
   Inmates at Alderson hate the idea of being transferred to
another prison, which is a considerable incentive for good behavior.
   Says Liz, the 30-year termer: ``If they write a how-to book on
prison, the first thing it should say is, `If you have to go to
jail, ask for Alderson.'''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Stew Leonard runs a happy carnival of a store,
and he usually plays to a full house. In transforming a plain dairy
into a kind of grocery Disneyland, he set the bottom line to
dancing. His other secret is chiseled on a big rock for all to see,
and he practices it to the letter.

   The crowd's five deep at the petting zoo
and just parking the car requires patience, skill and help from a
guy in a sheriff's uniform directing bumper-to-bumper traffic
around a huge lot.
   Inside, robot dogs sing mournfully of lost love and Rich Milk,
spokescarton for ``The Farm Fresh Five,'' an animated quintet of
dairy products, plays to a packed house. College kids in cow
costumes cavort between shows and helium balloons float through
popcorn-scented air.
   It's not a theme park, it's ``The Disneyland of Dairy Stores,''
as Rich Milk puts it. Should that description stay with you, owner
Stew Leonard won't mind a bit. ``Disney's my hero,'' he says.
   ``The Different Dairy'' is another catch-phrase, and proof of
that can be found on the bottom line: Stew Leonard's Dairy Store
sells $100 million worth of food a year, more per square foot than
any other grocery. This despite an inventory of 700 items _ a
typical supermarket carries 24,000 _ and the presence of 93 other
markets within 15 miles of that clogged parking lot.
   Each year, 500,000 pounds of butter, 10 million quarts of milk
and 500 tons of salads pass his computerized checkouts; in a
typical week, 100,000 pounds of his buddy Frank Perdue's chickens
fly off the shelves.
   Leonard focuses on customers; 100,000 troop through every week,
and his mission's to see that they walk out happy. To do that, he
gives them what they want the way they want it. Choosy about
berries? He'll put them out loose. Prefer fish on ice instead of on
Styrofoam? He'll build a fish bar.
   The responsiveness works both ways. Stew's customers stuff his
suggestion box with more than 100 comments a day, and some come in
on Sundays to put in their two cents in person, at monthly meetings
with management.
   A vacationing shopper homesick for the store sent a snapshot of
herself holding a Stew Leonard's bag in Moscow's Red Square. Stew
tacked it up. He's since received 7,000 pictures of customers and
bags at such spots as the Taj Mahal and the Great Sphinx. His
favorite: an underwater shot of skin divers holding their bag
beneath the Bermuda Triangle.
   The store's ``a mini-carnival'' to customer Doris Brown of
Norwalk, who says taking her two preschoolers ``can take the edge
off a very bad day.''
   The large sales and loyal following, combined with a
cheerleading management style that stresses teamwork, advancement
and fun, have made Stew Leonard a small-business superstar. He's in
a dozen books (Tom Peters' ``A Passion for Excellence'' mentions
him 22 times) and numerous marketing and management training
videos. He's the star of a Dale Carnegie ad campaign. And recently,
he was one of 11 business people honored by President Reagan.
   Leonard's advice to the next generation of corporate Americans,
already dissecting his methods in business schools across the land:
``Don't go into business to get rich. Do it to enrich people. It
will come back to you.
   ``Big business always makes it sound so complicated,'' he adds.
``You don't have to reinvent the wheel. You just have to care.''
   Like friend and neighbor Paul Newman, whose salad dressing he
helped launch, Leonard has now tasted fame. Unlike the actor, who
``puts his coat over his head when he goes out to dinner,'' Leonard
is eating it up.
   ``I can hardly believe it,'' says the silver-haired,
bespectacled grocer. ``To be the hero in your own thing, that's the
dream of every entrepreneur.''

   The philosophy that got him here is literally chiseled in stone
outside the dairy, a rambling gray building that resembles a barn.
A three-ton hunk of granite at the entrance reads:
   ``Rule 1 _ The customer is always right.
   ``Rule 2 _ If the customer is ever wrong, re-read Rule 1.''
   Skeptics need only hang around the customer service counter
where cheerful employees soothe the disgruntled. Recently, they
included a woman complaining of stale coffee beans. When had she
bought them? ``Two years ago.'' She got a refund, as did the
shopper who returned her Christmas tree in March.
   It had dried out.
   Not long ago, a woman asked for _ and got _ a refund for 20
pounds of shrimp. Later, a worker discovered she'd never paid for
them.
   ``My hardest job is not to catch her, but to keep those people
on the customer service desk from developing a bad attitude,'' says
Leonard, who thinks ``999 people out of a thousand are honest.''
   ``I know I've got to get cheated once in awhile, but don't tell
me about it. Don't shade my thinking.''
   ``I grew up in Norwalk, so I feel like it's part of me,'' says
employee Richard Lung, who works on ``Stew's News,'' a sort of
``People'' magazine for employees that a business magazine calls
``the ultimate company newsletter.''
   ``I had no art degree, but four years ago, he gave me a chance.
I'm glad _ it's a special place to work.'' Among other fringe
benefits, Lung says, his employer has paid for art classes and
seminars at Bridgeport University.
   Some kids dream of becoming movie stars. Stew Leonard dreamed of
being a milkman. The youngest of seven, he'd get up at 4 a.m. for
the thrill of riding along on his father's Norwalk milk route.
   His father died four months after Stew graduated from college.
He took over the business, got married, had four children. Then, in
1968, the state built a highway through his dairy.
   Leonard gambled he could get customers to make a special trip
for milk by building a store around a dairy.
   He was 38 years old. He remortgaged his house, dipped into his
kids' college fund and borrowed $482,500 from the Small Business
Administration, a record amount at the time.
   From the beginning, the store was different. Instead of many
narrow aisles, Leonard built one wide labyrinth that brings
customers face-to-face with the entire inventory. In 1969, the year
he opened, it consisted of seven items.
   Since then, he's added on 27 times. The store now features a $1
million kitchen that turns out 200 salads and hot entrees daily, a
barbecue department and a seasonal garden shop that pops up with
the crocuses.
   The milk-processing plant, which pasteurizes and packages 5
million half-gallons of milk and 1{ half-gallons of orange juice
annually, is glassed-in so customers can watch cartons whiz by at
150 per minute.
   Stew's children have all joined the business.
   A firm believer in nepotism, Leonard has 22 relatives in the
store. Half his 600 employees have relatives here too. ``It's very
good for the culture of a company,'' he says.
   In spare moments, Leonard works on his design for the new and
improved Stew Leonard's, set to open in Danbury in two years. He
says it'll be similar to Norwalk, only bigger.
   And this time, the cows will be real.

   WATER VALLEY, Miss. _ The 20th century was not quite four months
old when railroad engineer John Luther ``Casey'' Jones crashed the
Cannon Ball Express into a freight train at Vaughan, Miss., and
became an American folk hero.
   Bruce Gurner had not been born then, but you'd never guess it
listening to him talk, sitting under a shade tree in his front yard
on the edge of town, thumbs tucked under the bib of his overalls, a
railroader's cap on his head.
   ``Casey Jones was a good engineer,'' he was saying. ``Casey
would have made a good jet pilot. He was a bit of a chance-taker,
but he got caught in a trap that was not of his own making.
   ``If Casey hadn't of gotten killed, he would have died of a
broken heart, because he sure would have gotten fired for what
happened. Railroading was his first love. Even his wife Janie _ she
was the cutest thing _ came in second to railroading.''
   Bruce Gurner, 68, former schoolteacher and railroad engineer,
historian and photographer, fisherman, curator of his own backyard
museum of railroad memorabilia, chronicler of the last ride of
Casey Jones. Retired 10 years ago, after losing the sight in his
left eye, Gurner spends much of his time these days in his canoe
out on Enid Reservoir, running trotlines in quest of crappie and
catfish.
   ``I tried to be a commercial fisherman for a while after I
retired, but I found out that when you do it regular it's not as
much fun,'' he says. ``No telling where I would have gone if I
hadn't been kind of lazy.''
   For 40 years or so he had alternated between two careers,
railroading and teaching in high school. He was also shooting
pictures for the local weekly newspaper and working with the
Yalobusha County Historical Society, while raising five sons and a
daughter.
   Among his fondest memories are working on the City of New
Orleans, like his father and his uncles. That's the passenger train
that splits the heartland on its 920-mile run from Chicago to New
Orleans and was made famous by Arlo Guthrie's hit folk song in 1972.
   ``When I quit teaching at Oxford I put in two years on that
beautiful City of New Orleans firing (working as a fireman) for Cap
Gardner. Boy, was that high living. Making twice as much money as I
was teaching. Eight days a month off.''
   If you want to listen, Bruce Gurner can talk to you for hours
about highballing up and down the Illinois Central tracks from
Memphis, Tenn., to Canton, Miss., and the golden era of steam
locomotives, in the days when Water Valley was a railroad town,
with a big roundhouse and shop, and people like Casey Jones lived
there.

   ``Come all you rounders if you want to hear
   ``The story told of a brave engineer;
   ``Casey Jones was the rounders name,
   ``A high right-wheeler of mighty fame.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``It took me 25 years to figure out what happened to him down
there at Vaughan,'' says Gurner, who collected rare photographs and
old railroad records and the recollections of Casey Jones' widow
and the old-timers who had ridden with him. ``Thing is, nothing
would have ever come of it except that an engine wiper in the
Canton shop, who was an old friend of Casey's, wrote that ballad
about it and some vaudeville performers picked it up.
   ``Engineers were getting killed all the time in those days of
heavy traffic on single-track railroads, when slow freights had to
be sidetracked to make way for the passenger trains. Sometimes they
didn't even get their names in the paper when they got killed, but
Casey had a song written about him and America had a new folk
hero.''
   At 12:50 a.m. on the morning of April 30, 1900 Casey Jones
pulled out of Memphis' Poplar Street Station at the throttle of the
Cannon Ball Express, with Sim Webb as his fireman and J.C. Turner
the conductor. Casey was leaving an hour and 35 minutes late and
wanted to make up the time before he reached Canton.

<TEXT>
   In an self-published account of Jones' last ride, Gurner, who
has made that same run many times, described how Jones had probably
made up that lost time.
   ``Passenger comfort was not too important in those days and
damage suits for being thrown about at high rates of speed almost
unheard of,'' Gurner says.
   The Cannon Ball was on time when it reached Goodman, 10 miles
north of Vaughan, but disaster awaited down the tracks. To make way
for the passenger train, two long freights, one headed north and
one headed south, were switched off to a siding on the East side of
the main line, but the caboose and three cars of the southbound
train were still protruding onto the main line.
   Sim Webb the fireman first saw the caboose, shouted, and jumped
to safety. Casey Jones hit the emergency brakes but stayed with his
engine as it crashed into the rear cars of the freight and lunged
to the left, coming to rest pointing in the direction it came. A
bolt or a splinter of lumber pierced Jones in the throat. He was
taken on a stretcher to the depot a half-mile away, where he died
lying on a baggage wagon.
   In addition to Webb, three passengers, an American Express
messenger, and two postal clerks were slightly injured.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``All the crew safe, you say, and the passengers too?
   ``Thank God, that is clever,
   ``And his soft eyes closed as his pale face smiled
   ``And he whistled down brakes forever.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   What went wrong? Webb said later he saw a flagman and heard the
torpedoes, explosive devices placed on the tracks to warn the
engineer, but Gurner contends Jones was ``short-flagged.''
   ``The flagman didn't get far enough back for Jones so see him in
time to stop,'' he says.
   Nonetheless, the railroad's investigation concluded that,
``Engineer Jones was solely responsible for the accident as a
consequence of not having responded to flag signals.''
   According to railroad records, the Illinois Central Railroad
awarded Webb $5 for his injuries. The messenger, who hurt his back,
got $23, and the two postal clerks $1 each.
   Why didn't Casey jump?
   ``That is really the hard one to answer,'' Gurner says. ``Once
the engineer puts the brake in emergency, reverses the engine and
opens the sanders, the engine has no further need of his services.''
   Even though Gurner insists Jones was a ``fine engineer,'' he
found railroad records that showed Jones had been suspended nine
times, for periods ranging from 5 days to 30 days, for safety
violations between Feb. 14, 1891 and May 22, 1899. The offenses
included such things as ``collision in Water Valley Yard,''
``running through switch at Carbondale,'' ``for not recognizing
flagman who was protecting work train.''
   Jones lived in Water Valley from 1893 to 1896. He moved his wife
and three sons back to Jackson, Tenn., at his wife's insistence,
but he retained his membership in the Water Valley lodge of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. Today there are Casey Jones
museums at Jackson and at Vaughan, where much of Gurner's
memorabilia is on display.
   Gurner, being from a family of railroaders, got interested in
railroad history and began taking pictures as a boy. In 1940 he
signed on as a machinist's apprentice at the Illinois Central shop
in Paducah, Ky., where the Water Valley shop had been transplanted.
He got to know men like Bob Moore, a retired engineer, and Bob
Ward, a retired shop man, who had known Casey Jones well.
   ``When they tore the old Water Valley depot down, I got this
wealth of old records that were being hauled off to the garbage
dump,'' Gurner says.
   But the railroad in Water Valley today is only a memory.
   ``They ran the last train in February of '82,'' Gurner says.
``They even took up the tracks. That was adding insult to injury.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's the largest walrus hauling ground in the
United States, an island off southwest Alaska that each summer
attracts thousands of the 2-ton mammals with their long tusks. But
the numbers of walruses on Round Island have been dwindling in
recent years, from a peak of 15,000 in the mid-1970s to about 4,500
this summer. State biologists blame the noise.

<DATELINE>ROUND ISLAND, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Noisy sight-seers and fishermen
intruding on the walruses of Round Island may be causing the
blubbery beasts to defect to the Soviet Union where they enjoy more
privacy.
   Each summer, thousands of bull walruses haul out on the huge
rocks that ring the shore of this mist-enshrouded island 13 miles
off southwest Alaska.
   The puffing, snorting, hissing mammals ponderously heave their 2
tons of bulk from the frigid waters of the Bering Sea and shoulder
and poke their way with their huge ivory tusks into the overlapping
mass of their thick-skinned brethren.
   Each is seeking a place in the sun, a spot to rest between
seven- to 10-day feeding frenzies.
   From a distance, they look like layers of cinnamon-colored
fringe stitched to the base of the cliffs. Up close, they look more
like bewhiskered bachelors sleeping off the effects of a boozy
beach party _ eyes closed, heads down, their bodies oozing into
crevices in the rocks.
   While the males are piled up on beaches as far south as Kodiak
Island and Yakutat Bay, the females and their young remain with the
pack ice north of the Bering Strait and into the Arctic Ocean.
   But the number of Pacific walruses that haul out here and in
lesser numbers at the other six islands of the Walrus Islands State
Game Sanctuary have started to decline again, after a spectacular
comeback that peaked in the 1970s.
   On Round Island they have enjoyed considerable privacy in the
past, largely because of the weather and location. The nearest
community is Togiak, some 33 miles by charter boat to the northeast.
   Summertime weather is characterized by wind, rain and high waves
that make approach by floatplane or small boat hazardous if not
impossible.
   But with increased commercial bottom-fishing activity and the
prospect of oil exploration and development in salmon-rich Bristol
Bay, all that isolation may come to an end. And that has some
professional walrus watchers concerned.
   ``Walruses are pretty sensitive to disturbance,'' says Lloyd
Lowry, a marine mammal specialist with the Alaska Department of
Fish and Game in Fairbanks.
   ``There's more than a little concern that the noise caused by
the fishery has adversely influenced the haul-out. People on the
island say they sometimes can hear the radios on the bridges of the
boats.''
   Ken Taylor, another state biologist, monitors walrus numbers
from his office in Dillingham.
   ``In the mid-1970s, we had as many as 15,000 animals there,''
Taylor says. ``It was 4,400 last year and about 4,500 now. The
difficult thing is there are so many reasons for the numbers to go
up and down.
   ``To my mind, the sheer number of boats out there with motors
droning in the water sets up an acoustical noise that may be a
cause.''
   The two game technicians on Round Island this summer, Polly
Hessing and Judy Brandt, say they counted as many as 180 boats in
the area during a peak fishing period this spring.
   Although the vessels were outside the two-mile limit established
around the sanctuary, the noise they made was loud enough to force
the women to close the windows in their cabin so they could get
some sleep.
   The state set up the sanctuary in 1960 to protect the last
remaining walrus hauling grounds in the south Bering Sea.
   Thirty permits a day _ half for overnight and half for day use _
are available for people wishing to visit the island.
   Access, however, is restricted to a narrow corridor fronting a
grassy campground. New arrivals are asked to anchor offshore until
the technicians can pick them up in their small, inflatable raft.
   Although walruses get top billing, the treeless island also
supports nearly 450,000 sea birds, primarily common murres,
black-legged kittiwakes, cormorants, parakeet auklets, horned and
tufted puffins and gulls.
   Red fox on the island are unafraid of people and often share
trails with campers.
   Hundreds of sea lions provide a change in the soundtrack on the
island's southern beaches, and a showy mix of wildflowers anchors
the thin soil on its talus-covered slopes.
   No one seems to know much about the dynamics of the Pacific
walrus herd. It's believed to comprise some 234,000 animals, back
to its 18th century levels before commercial harvesting severely
depleted its numbers.
   ``We have a lot of broad-scale information, but little in the
way of specifics about haul-outs and food,'' Lowry says. ``We know
the population is large; we don't know its bounds. Walrus came back
from virtually no animals in the '40s, to peak counts in the late
'70s.''
   The population on Round Island dipped as low as 3,000 in 1983.
   Changes in the climate, variations in the food chain, the
growing volume of noise and other human disturbances are being
blamed for what appears to be a downward trend.
   ``Two years does not a trend make, but we are becoming
concerned,'' Lowry says. ``Walrus are fairly traditional about
where they haul out. So are sea lions. But there are several other
places they could go and we don't know if the herd is simply
splitting up or what it's doing.''
   The two-mile buffer and surveillance by fish and game personnel
stationed there from May to September of each year is credited with
limiting some of the human disturbance, such as illegal hunting,
spotter planes from the herring fishery buzzing the island and
boats coming too close.
   Taylor says the Soviet Union is more protective of its walrus
herd.
   ``On the Soviet coast, aircraft are held to 10,000-foot minimums
and boats restricted to 16 miles,'' he says. ``It may be because of
those more severe restrictions that more Pacific walruses are
hauling out there.''
   Officials are considering tightening regulations governing at
least the fishery near Round Island.
   ``This is a unique place, the largest hauling ground in the
United States,'' Lowry says. ``It would be a shame to lose it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The baroque St. Paul's Cathedral, designed by
Sir Christopher Wren, is a beloved national monument in Britain. It
is also at the center of a heated debate over modern architecture,
since developers have a plan to rebuild much of the neighborhood
near the cathedral. Leading the opposition is Prince Charles, who
has emerged as a highly outspoken critic of today's buildings.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles, Britain's best-known critic of
modern building, has put architects on the line in the one place
they cannot afford to blunder: opposite St. Paul's Cathedral.
   The domed cathedral in London, burial place of the nation's
heroes, survivor of the Nazi blitz, is now the focal point of a
heated debate about how cities should preserve their heritage while
coping with modern needs.
   The debate is symptomatic of a dilemma confronting all historic
cities. In the words of architecture professor Charles Jencks, ``In
most cities of the West there is a genteel blood bath going on
among those who have different tastes.''
   Nowhere is that battle more intense than at Paternoster Square
facing the north side of St. Paul's.
   Developer Tony Clegg, who owns most of the 7-acre site, plans to
tear down a clump of undistinguished 1960s office blocks and put up
more offices and shops.
   But Prince Charles, who got married in St. Paul's, hates Clegg's
plan. Although he has no architectural background, he has made the
subject one of his favorite hobbyhorses, and his opinions carry
weight.
   The baroque cathedral designed by Sir Christopher Wren is a
beloved national monument. So the developers consulted with the
Church of England, the Royal Fine Art Commission and other
interested bodies, and invited seven architects to compete for the
development.
   They also invited the heir to the throne to see the plans.
Charles disliked them all, telling a banquet in London's City
financial district last December: ``I was deeply depressed that
none of them had risen to the occasion.''
   ``Surely here, if anywhere, was the time and place to sacrifice
some profit, if need be, for generosity of vision, elegance and
dignity, for buildings which would raise our spirits and our faith
in commercial enterprise and prove that capitalism can have a human
face,'' the prince said.
   He likened much of the rebuilding of British cities since World
War II to a rape, and in his most controversial utterance,
suggested that modern London architecture was more unsightly than
the rubble left by the German bombers.
   Clegg conceded in an interview that ``there's been a lot of
criticism'' of the Arup Associates plan which his Mountleigh Group
chose.
   But he added that tastes change, noting that the existing plaza
and buildings, now despised, were much admired when they went up in
the 1960s,
   It is the prince's view that architecture should put people
first. ``Hurrah for the champion of ordinary people...Prince
Charles is acting as the conscience of the nation,'' wrote
architecture critic Gavin Stamp in The Daily Telegraph.
   The concrete shopping centers, dull office blocks and high-rise
public housing that typify many British cities were built hastily
to replace war rubble and solve the postwar housing shortage.
   Now, many are so hated that they are being dynamited by city
authorities. Today, many inner-city housing complexes consist of
cottages and gardens that mesh well with Charles'
small-is-beautiful philosophy.
   In Pittsburgh last March, Charles told a conference of
international architects that after 40 years of town-planning in
the United States and Britain, ``the results have been pretty
disastrous.''
   Charles went public on architecture in 1984, and has developed
his theme with mounting fervor, claiming to speak for ordinary
people whose views are ignored by the professionals.
   Although self-appointed as an arbiter of taste, 39-year-old
Charles is one of the most popular members of the royal fmily, and
his views get results.
   A projected extension to the National Gallery art museum in
Trafalgar Square was shelved after he called it a ``monstrous
carbuncle on the face of a well-loved friend.''
   Then he dismissed a 20-story tower design of the late Mies van
der Rohe, for a site near the Bank of England, as a ``giant glass
stump.'' It too was scrapped. This year his written complaint about
apartment blocks planned near his Kensington Palace residence led
to their alteration.
   Charles likes classical style buildings recalling 18th century
Georgian architecture, itself inspired by ancient Rome. He prefers
buildings on a human scale with ground-level shops and somewhere to
sit down.
   Many architects are aggrieved at being attacked by a man who has
no formal architectural training. A Paternoster plan which the
prince favors _ John Simpson's arcaded shops and low-level main
buildings with columned facades and sculpture _ has met a lukewarm
response.
   Architect Maxwell Hutchinson, tapped as the next president of
the Royal Institute of British Architects, accuses the prince of
abusing his privileged position.
   Writing in The Independent newspaper, Hutchinson denounced the
``fogeyish obsession'' with classical styles and wondered why the
work of contemporary British architects such as Richard Rogers, who
co-designed the futuristic pipes-and-glass Pompidou Center in
Paris, is more admired abroad than at home.
   But Jencks, writing in The Observer weekly, remarked that most
people now preferred ``to live in traditional houses at a village
level, and possibly in some other century.''
   Jencks also told a London audience that Charles had played a
crucial role in widening the debate. ``We are closer now than we
have been for 70 years to welcoming different schools and
philosophies of architecture,'' he said.
   Wren also had problems. His first two designs for a replacement
of the medieval cathedral, destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666,
were rejected.
   His cathedral, which attracts 3 million visitors a year, has
become a tough act for any architect to follow.
   Asked if he was worried by all the publicity, Clegg, 51, said:
``I think anything worthwhile is going to involve a whole lot of
argument and it will be worth it. Even without Prince Charles, lots
of people would have taken a strong interest in this site.''
   Clegg estimates his development will cost $700 million to $850
million. He says he will apply for planning permission in December,
start building in 1990 and hopes to complete the job by 1993.
   The rival plans were displayed for four weeks in the crypt of
St. Paul's and attracted 7,000 visitors, 700 of whom left written
comments which the developers say will be considered in the final
plan.

   The people who will take ``Discover: the World
of Science'' into its fourth PBS season tend to think of the series
as a kind of curiosity shop.
   Little ideas that the imagination can pick up and handle. The
show for the most part leaves the panoramic views to ``Nova'' and
other ambitious programs that try to bring science to the public.
   ``A lot of people make the mistake of imagining that science is
too tough for them to get,'' says John Angier, one of the two
executive producers of the science program hosted by Peter Graves.
   ``Anybody can get science. It's about the world and how the
world works. To watch `Discover,' there is no need to know any
science. We always make sure whatever background you need is right
in the story.
   ``We emphasize human interest. We do a medical story through the
eyes and experience of an individual. We follow the progress of a
patient over a long period of time.''
   Graham Chedd, Angier's partner, says, ``People tend to think of
scientists as dull, boring or whacked out. There are crazies out
there. There also are articulate, interesting people doing weird
and wonderful things. All they want to do is find out about
something or other. We're one of the few places they can
consistently tell their stories on TV.''
   Chedd continues, ``I don't want to knock `Nova' but they only
get to do 10 or 12 new productions a year. They have to pick big
subjects. We turn out 20 to 25 new stories; we can pick little ones
if we like.''
   ``Discover'' has five shows in a season, monthly, starting in
October.
   Angier studied physics and likes animal and aviation stories.
Chedd, who studied biology, prefers space and medical stories. They
make an eclectic team, poring over academic, scientific and medical
research journals, fishing in deep waters for scientific game of
all sizes.
   ``A sub-part of a story published in a journal may become our
story,'' Chedd says.
   When they heard about some guy in western Massachusetts who was
doing lightning research, they sent their people there, then west
to a mountain in New Mexico which has the most lightning in the
country.
   While in New Mexico, one of them happened to run into people
doing a dinosaur dig, looking for a 140-foot seismosaurus, another
story lead for ``Discover.''
   Chedd and Angier, both born in England, met through ``Nova,''
which Angier calls ``the granddaddy of science broadcasting in this
country.
   ``I was one of the first producers on that. I came from the BBC.
Graham was our first science editor. He was doing something for the
American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington
and started advising us on science content.''
   They formed Chedd-Angier Production Company in 1980 in Boston.
   ``We went along to the publisher of Discover magazine and
suggested to him a TV companion and that we make it. To our
amazement, he listened to us,'' Angier says.
   The TV show mentions the magazine and the magazine mentions the
show, but stories in the two are different.
   ``Discover'' started life in 1981-82 as a commercial TV program
to be syndicated. ``It was a fabulously expensive way of
distributing,'' Angier says. ``That's why our series eventually
moved to public television.''
   Chedd says the audience for ``Discover'' has consistently grown.
   ``Independent production companies in the documentary field are
usually a free-lance producer with an assistant,'' Angier says.
``We're relatively unusual in that we have 35 people working,
including 10 to 15 producers. In Hollywood there are giants, but
they're usually entertainment. As far as I know, there's no other
company like ours.''
   Chedd-Angier also does stories for ``Nova'' and science
productions for corporations. They currently have in production 26
half-hour educational shows about statistics, at the first-year
college level.
   GTE, which is underwriting ``Discover'' for the fourth season,
sends several million free teachers' guides and activity sheets to
schools which use the show in science teaching.
   Chedd-Angier also is working on a 10-part series on the global
environment and planning an eight-part series about molecular
biology and genetic engineering, both with WGBH in Boston for 1991.
   Both men still do some on-site producing for ``Discover.''
   ``I was doing a story about the recovery of Mount St. Helens,''
Angier says. ``It turns out one of the chief ways in which nature
is rebuilding itself there is by means of gophers. They dig through
the hard core of ash and bring soil to the surface and plants can
grow in it.
   ``I said to a scientist working there, `What we need is to get a
shot of gophers digging. How on earth are we going to do this?'
   ``He said, `They'll dig because they dig all the time.'''
   Angier pessimistically bet him a case of beer that the gophers
wouldn't cooperate with the cameras. He discovered that one reason
gophers are such good diggers is that they are always practicing.
They got nothing for their ``Discover'' appearance, but the
scientist got his beer.
   ``He was right. We got all the shots we wanted.''

   John Wallowitch is a sophisticated sprite of
Manhattan, an impish composer, pianist and cabaret performer who
celebrates New York and chronicles its often bizarre customs and
mores.
   He sings the music of Gershwin, Porter, Kern, Rodgers and Berlin
too, but he also performs his own compositions, usually songs about
Manhattan filtered through the sensibilities of the 1960s, '70s and
'80s. He can lament the loneliness of big-city life in ``I Live
Alone Again,'' laugh at growing old in ``I'm 27,'' or luxuriate in
the pleasures of high living in ``Back on the Town.''
   The classically trained musician sings anywhere and with little
coaxing: in his cluttered, score-strewn apartment, once the home of
actress Katharine Cornell; on his weekly cable television show; in
tiny nightspots around town, or even on the street, where his
yearly serenadings of Irving Berlin _ a Beekman Place neighbor _
have attracted more and more media attention.
   The impeccable Wallowitch, who seems always to be dressed in
white shirt and bow tie, has worked since 1984 with Bertram Ross,
once a leading dancer in Martha Graham's company.
   ``We have tons of material,'' says Wallowitch, a fanatic
collector of old sheet music. ``Three separate evenings of theater
songs, including one about New York. I could go through a year and
not repeat one song _ which I have done.''
   With Wallowitch providing piano accompaniment, Ross can launch
into obscure Berlin comic ditties like ``Cohen Owes Me 97 Dollars''
or ``Sadie Salome Go Home.'' Wallowitch can handle a tender, lush
love song, ``Come A Little Closer,'' that he wrote himself. Or the
duo can rip through virtually unknown songs from forgotten Broadway
shows like Rodgers and Hart's ``Chee-Chee.''
   Wallowitch's early world wasn't anywhere near the bright lights
of Broadway. He grew up in an isolated area of South Philadelphia,
a neighborhood across from the city dump and surrounded by gas
tanks of the Atlantic Refining Co. His father owned a butcher shop.
   Young John, the first of four children, was precocious, he
admits. After all, how many youngsters sing ``Genevieve, Sweet
Genevieve'' at the age of 3 months? In a few years, Wallowitch was
picking out tunes on his grandmother's piano, and having poems
published in a children's column of the local newspaper.
   `I guess it was desperation,'' he recalls. ``When you are born
in a neighborhood like that, you'd better do something.''
   Wallowitch did. He took piano lessons.
   Every Wednesday, the Wallowitch family would listen to the
Lithuanian Furniture Company Radio Hour. Their eldest son, wearing
knickers and anklets, made his piano debut on the program, playing
a Berlin song called ``So Help Me.''
   Wallowitch eventually became a regular on the show, usually
performing short classical pieces. His musical education continued
at Edwin Vare Junior High School, where he would sneak into the
building before classes to play a grand piano. He was caught one
day by the school's music teacher. Instead of punishment, he got
free lessons.
   He went to Temple to major in education so he could become a
high school music teacher, but was drafted.
   ``I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life,'' Wallowitch
says. ``But when I got into the Army something happened to me.''
   Each night, he went to the USO to play the piano.
   ``I became violent about it,'' Wallowitch says. ``I would push
people away from the piano and say, `I play better than you.' I was
terrible, but this was my life.''
   While in the Army, Wallowitch gave his first public performance
in front of an audience, 10,000 people in a stadium in
Jacksonville, Fla. He was to play ``Clair de lune,'' but forgot
part of the piece.
   ``I found myself talking over the microphone and pretending to
be doing a comedy routine,'' he says.
   Wallowitch, the cabaret performer, was born to great applause,
even if he was mortified about forgetting the notes.
   Wallowitch later returned to Temple and to his old high school
piano teacher. He eventually was drawn to New York to study music
at Juilliard. He was there for eight years, even getting a
post-graduate degree.
   ``To keep myself solvent, I played in tap-dancing schools and
for small dance companies,'' he says. He also entered the theater,
working as a rehearsal pianist for ``New Faces of '52,'' considered
the best of the Broadway revues of the 1950s.
   ``I was so dumb. I thought I was going to be this great concert
pianist,'' Wallowitch says. ``When you start to mix with show
people and you start to realize you have a talent in that area,
then you realize what it takes to be a concert artist and how few
people really succeed at it. There's the loneliness of that life
and the eight hours a day practicing.''
   He finally made his concert debut in October 1962 at Carnegie
Recital Hall, getting rave reviews.
   He toured Europe, under State Department sponsorship, with
actress and singer Ethel Barrymore Colt. He accompanied her
American theater songs, as well as doing his own program.
   Back in New York, he landed a job at a small Greenwich Village
nightclub. He played piano every night for six hours. He even
attempted to sing. One night, an irate customer yelled, ``Don't
sing, we want to talk.'' The next night Wallowitch came back with
an original composition, ``Who Needs Enemies When I Have a Friend
Like You'' and his songwriting career began in earnest.
   Today, Wallowitch concentrates on performing, writing only
occasionally.
   ``I can go on a writing jag because I have a lot of ideas,'' he
says. ``I store them. I feel like Ibsen, you know. He would think
about a thing for two years and then suddenly the whole thing falls
out.''

   Eight professors and eight students
have been shot to death in the past year, allegedly by right-wing
death squads, in a campaign of terror aimed at halting left-wing
activism at Medellin's University of Antioquia.
   It has succeeded.
   There has been a steady exodus of students since the killings
began; 39 professors have resigned. Textbooks that might be thought
to contain radical ideas have been removed.
   A great silence has fallen on a university that once prided
itself on an outspoken faculty and student body.
   ``Having an opinion is a crime,'' said Dr. Clemencia Hoyos, a
law professor. ``No one wants to talk now about social problems for
fear of being killed.''
   Violence had been frequent on the Antioquia campus, until two
years ago when demonstrating students set fire to a car on campus.
Two nuns happened to be in the randomly selected vehicle and they
burned to death.
   The incident drew national attention and campus violence, which
often included bombings by students, came to a halt.
   The incident also attracted the attention of death squads,
according to professors interviewed.
   Death squads have been linked to the killing of more than 800
people in Colombia in the last two years. So far not a single
arrest has been made in any of the deaths.
   Vigilantes are common in Colombia's small towns and rural areas
where hooded men mete out justice frequently to cattle thieves and
bandits.
   Except for a few isolated cases, vigilantes left universities
alone. Then starting last year, the vigilante-style killings came
to Antioquia _ the latest Aug. 6.
   All of the eight students slain were known radicals who made no
secret of helping make bombs or setting them off, according to a
half dozen university professors interviewed by The Associated
Press.
   The eight professors killed had been active in demonstrations to
get a university rector replaced or were outspoken in their
classrooms when it came to criticizing government agencies, the
interviewees said.
   Gunmen drove through the garage door at the home of one of the
professors and shot him to death in front of his wife and children.
   Other victims were snatched off streets.
   Their bodies, with hands tied behind their backs and showing
signs of torture, were found along highways outside of town. Each
victim had been shot in the back of the head. Some had their
fingernails pulled out.
   In the plaza of the 167-year-old university, students in the
past customarily spoke out on a range of issues in Colombia _
alleged government corruption, illegal arrests, and poverty.
   Antioquia students have a historical reputation as being the
most radical of any university in Colombia.
   Attacks by students and professors on the country's political
system had earned the university a reputation in Colombia as a
hothouse of Marxists, leftist guerrillas and terrorists.
   One professor, asking to remain anonymous for reasons of
personal safety, estimated that about 80 percent of the
16,000-member student body is leftist.
   Politics on campus range from anarchists and revolutionaries to
those who would like to see a socialist government in Colombia, but
who are not violent.
   Before the killings, student orators were free to talk on any
subject. A speech urging students to join Colombia's estimated
10,000 leftist guerrillas might have been followed by one demanding
more academic freedom.
   Now, however, students talk in hushed tones and fall silent when
a stranger draws near.
   Since the killings began, 1,350 students have left the
university, said the rector, Dr. Luis Javier Arroyave.
   Thirty-eight professors have resigned in fear of their lives,
according to Dr. Beatriz Ortiz, president of the 860-member
University of Antioquia Professors Association.
   Dr. Maria Teresa Uribe, a professor at the school of social
sciences, said some professors have replaced classroom texts that
might be considered sources of radical thought.
   Students stare numbly when asked to comment on a social issue,
she said.
   Mrs. Uribe noted that death threats had prompted her to stop
writing a weekly column in Medellin's leading newspaper, El
Colombiano.
   Mrs. Ortiz said she doesn't know how much longer she can endure
the stress.
   Since December, she said, she has lost 20 pounds, has
nightmares, rarely sleeps well and has developed a heart disorder,
severe headaches and almost constant aching in her shoulders she
attributes to tension.
   ``I feel so watched and followed that I take a lot of detours.
Sometimes I am so worried about someone following me that I'll
forget where I am going,'' she said.
   She and her husband had one German Shepherd dog but now have
three. They have installed bright yard lights.
   ``We never, never go out after 6 o'clock anymore,'' she said.
``I do my grocery shopping all over town so I won't follow any
routine.''
   Her 10-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter are no longer
permitted to go outside alone or to attend swimming classes.
   ``We all feel like prisoners,`` Mrs. Ortiz said.
   Each of the professors interviewed said he or she was sure that
government security forces are behind the terror.
   The professors said they have no doubt they are being watched
every moment and that their telephones are tapped.
   Two professors, members of the Medellin Human Rights Commission,
were killed after arriving at the commission's headquarters for the
first time in several days.
   The meeting had been arranged by telephone, said Dr. Carlos
Gaviria, a law professor.
   Gaviria, also a member of the human rights group, said he was
supposed to have been with the two men who had been killed but had
been delayed.
   Gaviria said he has taken a leave of absence from the university.
   Another professor was shot and killed while on his way from the
university to a friend's farm. The professor had been invited by
telephone only moments before he left the university, said Dr.
Hoyos, the law professor.
   No effort has been made by authorities to investigate the
Antioquia killings as an alleged conspiracy.
   As with the other similar killings in the country, the crimes
are being investigated on an individual basis.
   Criminal investigations in Colombia are made by appointed
judges, each of whom may have hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other
cases to deal with.
   The government, however, can appoint a judge to devote all his
time to one case if it feels the case is important enough.

   In five short years, Western Europe's Ariane rocket
has evolved from an Old World firecracker to a redoubtable launch
vehicle, competing with Americans for the multi-billion dollar
commercial space market.
   With bookings worth $2.48 billion _ 42 firm orders from around
the globe _ rockets are scheduled to blast off once a month
starting Sept. 8 for the next 10 months and continue at a pace of
nine launches a year.
   They will put into orbit satellites for businesses and
governments for use in improving communications, weather
forecasting, telephone links or television transmission.
   Ariane's commercial and technological success is a source of
pride for France, the rocket's main backer in the 13-nation
consortium.
   Above all, it provides a boost to the Europeans' late bid to
stake a claim to outer space.
   European perseverence in developing a throwaway rocket _ a
dinosaur in the age of manned space flight _ is sweetened by the
``I told you so'' syndrome.
   The United States, which was relying exclusively on the space
shuttle for satellite launches, has not yet recovered from the
Challenger disaster Jan. 28, 1986, but it hopes to re-enter the
picture sometime this year with a shuttle launch.
   Patrick Baudry, the French astronaut who was a crew member on a
1985 U.S. shuttle flight, said Ariane's success should not be
overstated, however.
   ``Ariane is just a launcher of satellites,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   ``In the end, Ariane performs a mission that the Russians and
the Americans have been capable of for 25 years. It's a technical
success, a commercial success. But there is still a long way to go
before Europe is a completely adult space nation.''
   A latecomer to space, Western Europe has a vision of becoming an
independent space power.
   ``The great nations of tomorrow will be those that can best
master space,'' said Baudry, echoing official thinking. ``The
success of Ariane is essential for more ambitious programs. It
symbolizes the mastery of technology.''
   Major European projects include an Ariane 5 rocket capable of
lifting a manned space shuttle, Hermes, into orbit a decade from
now and participation in the U.S. manned space station project.
   Not all European Space Agency (ESA) member nations are
enthusiastic about the plans.
   Britain dissented at a ministerial meeting in November of the
13-nation agency, which also is made up of Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, West Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Britain's industry and trade minister, Kenneth Clarke, called
the European plans to put men in space a ``hugely expensive
industrial frolic'' with ``rather too much smacking of me-tooism.''
   For now, the competition is on the ground, and it is growing
fierce.
   President Reagan's decision to forbid commercial launches on
future shuttle flights has given birth to a private U.S. space
industry. Once reliant on the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), major U.S. rocket builders must now compete
with a slick European sales machine that has been in place eight
years.
   The Soviet Union also has been wooing commercial customers for
space launches through a new organization called Glavkosmos. With
slick brochures and film advertisements, Glavkosmos proposes to
launch communications satellites and other payloads from foreign
countries aboard its powerful rocket booster, Proton.
   The first Soviet commercial launch earlier this year sent up an
Indian satellite.
   Soviet space officials, however, say they are having trouble
drumming up business because of Western governments' restrictions
on the export of high technology equipment to the Soviet Union.
   The restrictions discourage many potential customers from making
a deal with the Soviets.
   A child of the European Space Agency, the Ariane 1 through 4
series of rockets has been sold, financed and launched by ESA's
commercial spinoff, Arianespace, since 1980.
   Billed as ``the world's first commercial space transport
company,'' Arianespace is devoted to selling space on rockets and
placing its clients' satellites into geostationary transfer orbit,
about 22,000 miles from Earth.
   In 1987, Arianespace, a French company with 50 European
shareholders, who are mostly governments and state-run companies,
reported a 44 percent increase in profits over 1986.
   Sam Mihara, director of new business for the U.S. McDonnell
Douglas Delta Program, credits Arianespace with providing the
world's only available launcher after the Challenger accident.
   ``But a lot of the success of Ariane was unique to the
situation,'' he said.
   ``I consider Ariane as the new kid on the block,'' he said,
noting that Delta rockets have been launched for 28 years. ``What
might be new (for us) is a piece of paper. Previously, our
customers were buying with NASA. NASA was the sales agent.''
   McDonnell Douglas and its Delta rocket, General Dynamics with
its Atlas Centaur and Martin Marietta with the giant Titan are the
three rocket builders now at the heart of America's fledgling
private space launch industry.

   He is 3 years old, wearing a red T-shirt and
boasting how his dad had taken him to see the fireworks. His little
sidekick sucks on a Popsicle and shows off his purple tongue.
   ``You can't get me, Daddy,'' shouts one of the boys as he races
playfully down the hallway of the hospital wing.
   The illness that put them there is masked by their innocence and
perfectly normal ways.
   They are the children of AIDS.
   Not all are so free to run and play. Some come into the world
prematurely and drug-addicted. Many have swollen glands, sometimes
enlarged livers and spleens. Their bodies are wracked by diarrhea
and nausea, burning with fever and wet from night sweats.
   More than 500 of them across the United States have died of AIDS
and 3,000 are infected, according to Dr. James Oleske, medical
director of the children's AIDS program at Children's Hospital in
Newark, N.J.
   Their numbers are growing at an alarming rate in a nation
ill-equipped to care for them; in many places, hospitals must serve
as expensive baby sitters while foster homes are desperately sought
for the infants.
   Dr. Martha Rogers, chief of pediatric and family studies for the
AIDS program at the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
estimates about 10,000 children under the age of 13 will be
infected with the AIDS virus within a few years.
   That's the low end of Oleske's estimate; he foresees 10,000 to
20,000 infected children by 1991. ``I estimate that one in every 10
to 15 hospital beds for children in the United States will be
occupied by a child sick with (AIDS) infection. That is a
frightening statistic.''
   About 13 percent of the child victims got AIDS through tainted
blood transfusions.
   Almost all the others, however, were doomed before birth, born
to mothers infected with the AIDS virus through intravenous drug
use or through sex with a drug user. Six out of 10 of these
children die by age 2 or 3, Oleske said.
   The tragedy is compounded when the mother is a single parent and
unable to care for the infant because of her drug habit or because
she is incapacitated with AIDS herself. A grandmother may care for
both, watching both daughter and grandchild deteriorate and die.
   With family members unavailable to help in many cases, ``Where
are the increasing numbers of children born with AIDS going to be
cared for?'' Oleske asked. ``Who's going to care for them?''
   One answer may lie in the establishment of state-supported
transitional group homes that provide temporary care for outpatient
children until foster homes can be found. Several have been set up
in the last 18 months, including homes in Boston, Albany, N.Y., and
Elizabeth, N.J. More are being planned.
   At Boston City Hospital, a renovated wing known as Dowling 5
South can house four children. Among current residents are the two
boys whose fathers cannot care for them full-time but who take them
on outings like the Fourth of July fireworks.
   Since the Dowling wing opened in February 1987, the mothers of
two children living there have died.
   ``Give me two weeks,'' pleaded one mother _ and she held on long
enough to make arrangements for the care of her child.
   Anne Murphy, a 31-year-old social worker at Dowling 5 South, has
seen dying mothers ``just coming in and spending time with their
kids, playing with them, putting them to bed, feeding them supper,
some of the daily routine kind of things that I think take on so
much more meaning when you feel that your time could be limited.''
   For many of the chidren, however, the warmth of mothers and
fathers is absent, and nurses try to comfort them when they cry out
with withdrawal pains.
   Some of the older children, unable to understand what is
happening to them, turn to their toy doctors' kits and play out
their own tragic lives.
   ``They give us fake shots and take our blood pressure,'' said
Ms. Murphy. ``They play out a lot of the things that happened to
them in the hospital ... and kind of deal with the experience
removed from it in a way.''
   Many potential foster parents are reluctant to consider children
with AIDS _ fearful or ignorant of the disease or unwilling to
commit the extraordinary amount of time and energy required.
   Even so, seven children from St. Clare's Home in Elizabeth,
N.J., have been placed in foster homes, said Terry and Faye Zealand
who founded the place of transition between hospital and foster
care in May 1987. They plan to open two more homes in New Jersey.
   ``I can't find a cure for AIDS. I know that I have to leave that
up to somebody else but I know that I can provide a home for these
children,'' Mrs. Zealand said.
   In Elizabeth and Albany, townspeople have been sympathetic.
   Local construction workers helped renovate a two-story residence
that had been vacant for two years for St. Clare's Home. At a
zoning board hearing in Albany, three neighbors spoke in support of
the Farano Center for Children, which opened in December. Civic
organizations held fundraisers and donated furniture to the home
operated by Albany Catholic Charities.
   At the Farano Center, as many as 40 volunteers take the children
for walks and visits to the park. Three of these volunters have
become foster parents to AIDS children, and the applications of
four others are being considered.
   The transitional homes can accommodate only a half-dozen or so
children at a time, cared for by an around-the-clock staff.
   That leaves hospitals as the only home for many children of
AIDS. That is costly not only to them, in terms of childhood joys
missed, but also for the state. Each AIDS child's hospital stay
costs an average $650 a day because of the extra nursing care and
therapy required. This compares, for example, to $240 a day at St.
Clare's.
   Some of these kids have never played with a dog or felt the
sunshine.
   ``Everything is a sense of wonder or awe for these children,''
said Sister Maureen Joyce, who runs the Farano Center. ``I was
planting some flowers and brought kids out with me. They sat and
felt the grass. I had them help me plant flowers. They were so
excited.''
   Mrs. Zealand recalled a 4-year-old whose only playground was the
corridors of the hospital until she moved into St. Clare's.
   ``I can't begin to tell you the experiences she had, swinging on
the swings in the backyard, going to the parks and the
playground,'' said Mrs. Zealand. ``These are the things all kids
need.''

   John Edkin stood on the front porch of the
home he built with his own hands, jabbing his finger in the air and
complaining angrily about a farmhouse just 1,000 yards away that's
been proposed as a shelter for infants with AIDS.
   ``Hey, it's right in my backyard!'' exclaimed the 67-year-old
retired woodsman. ``I feel that we don't need them here. Sullivan
County is a nice clean county and we'd like to keep it that way.''
   Like Edkin, many of the 630 residents of Elkland Township, of
which Estella is a part, oppose the idea of the home, which would
care for up to six Philadelphia-area children aged 2 and under
until foster homes can be found.
   Elkland Township residents and officials deny discrimination
charges filed by the home's operators, Best Nest Inc. of Abington,
Pa. In its complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations
Commission, Best Nest accused the town of trying to block the home
by amending the building code and a toxic waste ordinance and by
``excessive and burdensome review.''
   Edkin says his biggest concern is property values in Estella, a
central Pennsylvania town so small it has more deer than people and
includes only a dozen homes, two churches, a country store, a
nursing home and the cabins that seasonal residents use for hunting
and weekend getaways. It is about 200 miles from Philadelphia.
   ``I talked to a real estate agent after this thing first come
in,'' said Edkin. ``And I said to him, `If I told you today I'd
take $30,000 for my home, what would you say to me?' He said, `I'd
tell you I'd give you 15.' The value of property is gone right
down.''
   The 12-bedroom farmhouse, hidden at the top of a mile-long dirt
road in this farming and lumbering region, was once a home for
emotionally disturbed teen-agers. It now has a temporary license to
house three infants. A 3-month old girl lives there now with her
foster mother.
   To take in more than three young children would require costly
renovations to comply with additional state and township
regulations. Township supervisors amended the building code to
place any group home whose income is more than $15,000 a year into
a tougher fire safety classification, mandating sprinkler systems,
fire walls, emergency lighting and fire escapes.
   The 100-year-old house has none of these, and Pennsylvania
officials and Scott Eldredge, the social worker who directs Best
Nest, agree such renovations might be prohibitive.
   Townspeople and officials suggested Best Nest is a family
venture out to make a buck through the $197 to $227 a day it would
receive in government funds for each child and through a
tax-exemption it sought as a non-profit corporation. The exemption
was denied, according to Kenneth Levitzky, the county solicitor,
after Best Nest failed to prove eligibility with financial data.
   ``I haven't been paid a dime for what I've done,'' Eldredge
said. ``I grew up in a home where there was emphasis on helping
other people.''
   Residents say they are being painted as the bad guys when their
concern is the children's safety. The nearest hospital is an hour
away, they note.
   Clinics and doctors, however, are available nearby, and state
officials say it has not been clearly demonstrated that medical
care would be a problem.
   The question of the children's race arose at a town meeting, but
Betty Reibson, a dairy farmer and secretary-treasurer of Elkland
Township, said residents simply wanted all the information they
could get.
   ``We're not trying to be discriminatory,'' she said. ``We've
never said we don't want this type home. We're saying we want
regulations. We feel these children have the right to have the best
facility that would provide them the care and protection they
need.''
   But John Edkin's wife, Eleanor, says she's heard town residents
``growl about the black people.''
   No blacks live in the township except for a 1-year-old boy _
tested positive for AIDS _ who is the foster child of Scott
Eldredge's brother, Malcolm, and his wife, Kim.
   They live next door to the proposed group home and would run it
if it opens. The Eldredge brothers' parents and grandparents live
along the same road on the other side of the proposed shelter..
   Malcolm and Kim previously ran the home for troubled teen-agers.
Last year, Best Nest bought it for $27,000 from Berachah Farm, a
non-profit Christian group. The home was closed for financial
reasons and because of problems in setting up schooling.
   Commenting on the farmhouse's distance from Philadelphia, where
the children would come from, Scott Eldredge said the family had
``looked for a home closer to Philadelphia and if we had had the
financial backing to purchase a home in Philadelphia, we would have
done that.''
   ``We have used our own personal funds to purchase this home,''
he said. ``Our goal was to buy a home already licensed as a group
home because we knew there could be problems with discrimination
against a home for children with AIDS.''
   Of the township's opposition, Malcolm Eldredge said, ``I think
it's representative of a few loud-mouthed people. There's quite a
few people that are very positive and say, `We agree with what
you're doing. We think it's a good thing. We're behind you.'''
   Among those is Grace Frounfelker, a 68-year-old lay speaker in
the United Methodist Church who was a member of the board of
trustees of Berachah Farm.
   ``It is offering a Christian home and love to babies that were
being left in hospitals,'' says Mrs. Frounfelker. ``It is a
ministry which the Lord Jesus upheld when he said let the children
come to me and do not hold them back for such is the kingdom of
God.''

<HEAD>Transvestite And AIDS Toddler Form Unusual Family</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-AIDS Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A transvestite and a toddler with AIDS-related complex are
living together in an ususual foster parenting arrangement, as
officials increasingly look to non-traditional care for a growing
number of children with the disease.
   ``We have to aggressively search out foster parents,'' said
Norman Reim, a spokesman for the New Jersey Division of Youth and
Family Services. ``New Jersey is breaking new ground in the nation
in the way it handles pediatric AIDS cases.''
   Of the 164 New Jersey children who have tested positive for the
AIDS virus, the majority are with relatives, but 46 are in foster
care and five are at a group home in Elizabeth, Reim said.
   His agency agreed to let a reporter visit the transvestite
foster parent and child only on condition that their hometown and
names not be disclosed.
   ``Bobby,'' as the foster parent will be called here, says his
life has been fulfilling since he brought home 3-year-old ``Kevin''
in December.
   They live in an old neighborhood, where drug addicts and
alcoholics hang out on street corners. The toddler is never far
from Bobby's side.
   ``I've had to cut back on entertaining my girlfriends,'' Bobby
said, referring to his transvestite friends. ``That's the hardest
thing. ... But I have to be careful about who comes in now.''
   He acknowledges his homosexuality and his penchant for living
like a woman and wearing feminine clothing and jewelry. Since
becoming a foster parent he has stopped working as a female
impersonator, he said.
   He wants Kevin, who doesn't know he's a man, to think of his
foster parent as an aunt.
   ``I don't want Kevin to call me `mom' because I'm not his
mother,'' he said. ``If I kept him, as he got older I would have to
someday explain my lifestyle to him.
   ``You know, we're all people, regardless of our lifestyles.
We're all God's people, and the way we dress or act doesn't make us
love any differently,'' he said. ``My sexual preference is
different, but nothing else is.''
   Bobby's male companion does not live at the house, but is a
frequent visitor. In the course of their relationship, Bobby
decided he wanted the fulfillment of a child.
   ``I went to see DYFS, and I was a little surprised that they
even talked to me,'' he said. ``They came out to inspect my home,
but I really didn't think it would go through. People are
stereotyped about gay people.''
   When the state approached Bobby about caring for an AIDS child,
he was skeptical.
   ``Then I realized that these kids don't get the love they should
get,'' he said. ``Most people don't want sick children, especially
children with AIDS. They see them, they think they're cute, but
they don't want them.
   ``The first time I went to the hospital to see him, I thought he
would be a little, sickly thing, but he's an adorable little kid.''
   State officials say they don't question a foster parent
applicant's sexual preference.
   ``When we evaluate a home, we check to see if the individual or
the people who will be parents in the home are able to provide a
loving, safe, nurturing atmosphere,'' Reim said.
   Foster parents who care for AIDS children receive $700 a month
and another stipend depending on how sick the child is, compared
with the average of $215 per month for foster children who are not
ill, Reim said.
   ``This is a new set of incentives to try and recruit foster
parents to take care of kids with AIDS,'' he said.
   ``You also have to realize that some of these children sometimes
need more intensive care, and sometimes will require a parent to be
home full-time,'' Reim said. ``You need to compensate them for
that.''
   Before Bobby could take Kevin home, he had to take extensive
lessons on how to care for an AIDS child. Rubber gloves must be
worn when changing diapers. The bathtub must be scrubbed with
bleach after each bath. Kevin must be closely watched when playing
with other children.
   ``Wearing gloves just kills me,'' Bobby said. ``To me, you pick
up trash and garbage with rubber gloves.
   ``But to me, it's basic care,'' he said. ``When he looks at me
with those eyes at night and hugs me before he goes to sleep,
there's no money in the world that can buy that feeling.''
   One of the harshest realities, however, is realizing that Kevin
may not live long.
   ``If he grows up to be 15 or 16, I'd be happy,'' Bobby said.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Moon Over Parador''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In ``Moon Over Parador,'' Paul Mazursky reworks ``The Prince and
the Pauper'' theme, adds outrageous farce and produces a
marvelously comic view of Latin American politics and the acting
profession.
   Mazursky's earlier career was marked by relationship
comedy-dramas, beginning with ``Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice'' and
continuing through ``Next Stop, Greenwich Village,'' ``An Unmarried
Woman'' and ``Willie and Phil.'' With ``Down and Out in Beverly
Hills,'' he broke through with a full-throttle comedy. ``Moon Over
Parador'' could repeat that success.
   Richard Dreyfuss is a New York actor constantly on the prowl for
that one star-making role. While he is playing a supporting role in
a movie being shot on the Caribbean island of Parador, he meets the
dictator-president and does an imitation of him.
   When the gourmand dictator dies of a heart attack during a
carnival, the chief of police and power behind the throne, Raul
Julia, uncorks a daring idea: Dreyfuss could impersonate the late
ruler and thus prevent a revolution. Under threat of death, the
actor accepts the role.
   Dreyfuss leaps into the impersonation, performing a brilliant
balcony speech before the populace. But of course he can't deceive
his servants, who decide to go along with the scheme. Nor can he
fool his mistress, Sonia Braga, who also agrees to keep his secret.
   Julia and his cohorts, who appear to be left over from old Nazi
movies, grow restless as Dreyfuss begins to propose liberal
reforms. The natives are restless, too, and Dreyfuss is nearly
killed by bombs. How he escapes from his predicament is an
ingenious piece of scripting by Mazursky and Leon Capetanos.
   The success of ``Moon Over Parador'' is due in large part to
ideal casting. Dreyfuss brilliantly portrays the insecurities of a
struggling actor, and he proves a masterful farceur. Julia, in a
Prussian wig, is the embodiment of slick evil, and Braga is both
funny and sexy.
   Mazursky highlights the comedy with real-life cameo appearances.
Sammy Davis Jr. sings for the carnival, Ike Pappas plays a
television reporter. Ed Asner kids himself by paying a friendly
visit to rebel camps in the mountains. The only disappointment is
the usually reliable Jonathan Winters. His CIA agent is written on
the one-note venality that has become a movie cliche.
   ``Moon Over Parador'' is rated PG-13, for bedroom scenes and
language. Running time: 104 minutes.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Written
on the Wind'' and ``A Tiger's Tale.''
   
   ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' (Touchstone Home Video; VHS-Beta,
$29.95; Rated R)
   
   Robin Williams was nominated for an Academy Award for his
portrayal of an irreverent and raucous Army deejay in Saigon during
the Vietnam War. Though not necessarily the talented comic's best
film role to date _ ``Moscow on the Hudson'' and ``The World
According to Garp'' may have been better _ the movie is nonetheless
a one-man tour-de-force.
   The movie is based on the real-life antics of Adrian Cronauer
(Williams), who arrives in Saigon in 1965, full of attitude and
independence _ not the best combination for the military
compulsives at Armed Forces Radio, which is languishing under an
easy-listening format.
   Cronauer's mission is to put life into the narcoleptic station,
and that he does beginning with his first rock 'n' roll shout of
``Goooooood Morning, Vietnam!'' He replaces Perry Como and Percy
Faith with James Brown and Jerry Lee Lewis. The grunts love it;
military brass is appalled.
   And with this popularity comes an inevitable clash with military
censors who sanitize the news and issue propaganda directives. But
Cronauer survives his critics only to tumble into the chilling
realities of the war and the authorities who help keep it boiling.
   Williams is at home as a deejay, obviously interspersing
Williams with Cronauer in what has to be one of cinema's longest
and greatest improvisations. He is explosive, enormously funny and
warm, injecting a humanity in an otherwise horrific landscape.
   Forest Whitaker, who was later tapped to portray jazz legend
Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's critically acclaimed ``Bird,''
puts in an expert performance as Cronauer's sidekick. Barry
Levinson's (``Diner'') direction is pristine.
   ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' is a contained story: There are no
Kubrick or Coppola-like underpinnings, and not much really goes on
outside of Cronauer's fight with the military; nor are there major
looks at the bloody battles that swirled outside Saigon _ and
inside, as well. Thus, it is a movie that indeed works better on
the home screen than as a theatrical release.
   Williams' impassioned and humorous performance makes it all
worthwhile, and besides, ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' is also a lot of
fun.

   ``Written on the Wind'' (MCA Home Video; VHS-Beta, $29.95; not
rated)
   
   This 1956 Universal release, starring Rock Hudson and Lauren
Bacall, has become something of a camp classic, a prime example of
director Douglas Sirk's talent for tales of overwrought passion.
   Contemplated calmly, everything about the movie is hard to take
seriously, from the premise, to the plot, to the scenery-chewing of
co-stars Dorothy Malone and Robert Stack.
   But that's missing the point. Forget calm. Forget serious. Sit
back and surrender to this steamy saga of the oil-rich Hadley
family and their fatal romantic frustrations. Odds are you'll enjoy
it, though you may hate yourself in the morning.
   Stack plays Kyle Hadley, the cynical, alcoholic scion who falls
hopelessly in love with Bacall and marries her after a courtship so
rapid it makes a whirlwind seem sluggish. Stack's best friend,
played by Hudson, is also hopelessly in love with Bacall, but
resolves to suffer silently.
   Enter Malone as Stack's sister. She is even more hopelessly in
love than the others _ with Hudson. Her unrequited passion has
turned her into a nymphomaniac. When Stack develops a small
fertility problem and Bacall turns up pregnant, it isn't hard for
the malicious Malone to persuade her brother his wife is fooling
around with his pal.
   Needless to say, before this tangled web is unraveled, a lot of
blood, sweat and tears have been shed.
   For her part in these carryings-on, Malone was awarded an
Academy Award as best supporting actress.

   ``A Tiger's Tale'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS@Beta, $79.95;
Rated R)
   
   In ``A Tiger's Tale,'' a 19-year-old high school student named
Bubber (C. Thomas Howell) falls for his girlfriend's mother, a
divorced nurse named Rose (Ann-Margret).
   It's easy to see why, but why she returns his affection _
setting off an affair lacking any heat at all _ is only one of the
things that doesn't make sense in this comedy-romance.
   There's also no good reason why Rose's bratty daughter (Kelly
Preston) is allowed to get away with just about anything, including
sabotaging her mother's sex life by poking a hole in her diaphragm.
   Or why Bubber, who intends to become a veterinarian, drags
around a full-grown tiger on a leash in small-town Texas.
   And then, there's the dialogue. Rose to Bubber: ``Sometimes when
your hair's messed up, you look like a partially open can.'' Or
Bubber to Rose: ``I may be 19 but I'm your man and you love me, and
I'm going to go sleep on the couch where a dejected man is supposed
to.'' And it wasn't even nighttime.
   Ann-Margret tries and almost rises above her role, and Charles
Durning as Bubber's father is good as usual. But the 1987 movie,
written and directed by Peter Douglas, son to Kirk and brother to
Michael, is just dumb.

   ``Live at the Whisky a Go-Go'' (Elektra) _ X
   
   The songs are short, the arrangements smart and the band
rambunctious on ``Live at the Whisky a Go-Go.'' X squeezes 24 songs
into the two-record set. Just about everything rocks, and just
about everything clicks.
   Lead guitarist Tony Gilkyson is the star of the show. Many of
the songs, such as ``Another Perfect Day,'' are built around
Gilkyson's riffs. And his breaks combine finesse with wild abandon;
they're two parts rockabilly and one part machine gun.
   Singers John Doe and Exene Cervenka are in top form, too.
Neither has a particularly appealing voice, but they blend together
well and come up with some great harmonies, often when the band is
playing at top speed.
   For the uninitiated, only the absence of a lyric sheet keeps
``Live at the Whisky a Go-Go'' from being a perfect introduction to
X. It's impossible to understand what Cervenka and Doe are singing
most of the time, but the general theme seems to be that life is
not a beach.
   ``I wish it would snow in Fort Lauderdale, or at least rain and
hail,'' Cervenka sings on ``Skin-Deep Town.'' On ``The World's a
Mess,'' she contends just that: ``Go to hell and see if you like
it,'' she suggests. It's good to know there are still a few bands
out there with a bad attitude.

   ``No Friction'' (Gramavision) _ Fool Proof
   
   This well-intentioned set of ``back to the roots'' blues by a
group of jazz players from varied backrounds reinforces two
lessons: Good intentions alone rarely get you very far, and it's
not easy to blend musical styles.
   Fool Proof combines the talents of nine jazzmen brought together
by Gramavision Records President Jonathan Rose, who was dismayed
that many new jazz musicians were neglecting their blues roots.
   The result, ``No Friction,'' though well-played throughout, just
doesn't measure up as a good blues record. Too often, the jazz
chops sound like an intrusion on the blues arrangements. And
several of the songs lack emotional punch _ a fatal flaw in blues
territory.
   There are a few bright spots. There's a tough workout of the old
Al Green hit ``Love and Happiness,'' the only cover on the album;
``Red Car,'' composed by cornetist Butch Morris, is a good, jumping
tune; and saxophonist Dwight Andrews' ``Title Nine Blues'' has a
certain eerie charm, if you can be charmed by 7:19 of moody riffing
under a recitation of lines such as, ``Red blues ... brown blues
... I don't recall blues ...''
   Ultimately ``No Friction'' fails to satisfy. One gets the
feeling, though, that the musicians here will keep the spirit of
the project alive as they resume their own diverse work. Which
might say something good about good intentions after all.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Ben Kingsley Returns to His Roots in the Theater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After his once-in-a-lifetime role as the
saintly Indian leader in ``Gandhi,'' Ben Kingsley faced the issue
of what to do with the rest of his career.
   He solved it by returning to his roots in the theater. Now, five
years after his Academy Award, he has completed five film projects
in a year. The roles range from Shostakovich in ``Testimony'' to
Lenin in an Italian miniseries to Dr. Watson in ``Without a Clue''
(with Michael Caine as Sherlock Holmes).
   Kingsley's current release, ``Pascali's Island,'' has drawn
critical praise for his carefully shaded portrayal of an informer
on a Turkish-held island in the Mediterranean early in the century.
   The British actor was here for the opening of ``Pascali's
Island.'' He is a slight, semi-bald man whose diffident manner
belies the onstage electricity he can generate as Hamlet or in his
one-man show about the English actor Edmund Kean.
   The character of Basil Pascali is full of complexities _ loyalty
vs. betrayal, sexual ambiguity. How does Kingsley explain him?
   ``Wow,'' he exclaimed. ``I hope I have explained him in my
performance. I'm always hesitant to explain. It's like an artist
who paints a portrait, and then he bores you by saying how he
painted it and why. The painting should speak for itself.
   ``Pascali is a very complex character; he's hard to talk about.
He exists on several levels: he's a spy; he loves a woman, and that
love is unrequited; he's a man who thinks in Turkish and speaks in
English; he's a man who has a very private ambition and a private
dream that no one knows about. That's four levels already.
   ``It was easier to play the whole, composite man. You know the
story of the ant and the centipede? Where the ant says to the
centipede: `How do you walk with all those legs?' And the next day
the ant finds the centipede on his back, counting his legs. He'd
never thought about it before. I think acting is a bit like that.''
   Kingsley researched his role with customary thoroughness. That
included the Turkish language.
   ``Apparently it is impeccable, I'm happy to say. There were some
Turks around the location (on Simi, near Rhodes). Between takes
they would come up to me and speak fluent Turkish. I had to
apologize and say, `I'm sorry but I can only speak the 17 lines
that are in the screenplay,''' he said.
   ``I had a very good teacher in England, and I had eight lessons
of one-hour long and learned it by ear, like a musical score. I did
know what I was saying, but I learned it phonetically.''
   ``Pascali's Island'' is directed by James Dearden, the man who
wrote ``Fatal Attraction,'' and co-stars Charles Dance (``The Jewel
in the Crown'') and Helen Mirrin (``Mosquito Coast''). It was a
reunion for Kingsley and Dance.
   ``When I was in the Royal Shakespeare Company 12 years ago,''
Kingsley recalled, ``I did a play called `Hamlet,' and I played
Hamlet and Charles played Fortinbras. We became good friends.
Theater companies do bind people together. It's like a little army
of people, and we go over the top every night.''
   Born in Lancashire, Ben Kingsley started in the theater at the
top, in the Royal Shakespeare Company. No spear-carrying, no
repertory. He found himself performing among the most distinguished
actors of the English theater. After four years, he moved to the
Royal Court, then the National Theater. In 1980, Richard
Attenborough chose Kingsley, who is part Indian, for the epic
``Gandhi.''
   After the Oscar, Kingsley devoted himself to ``Kean'' and other
plays, declining some heavy offers from Hollywood.
   ``When I won the Academy Award, I was not too well acquainted
with the community here,'' he explained. ``I'm a little bit more so
now, and I'm very fond of it. But it does have an energy of its own
that can rush you down a certain path, and you can get stuck.
   ``I have very good advisers in London, New York and Los Angeles
who work for the same company. They field most of the things, and
they advise me very carefully. So I find that I didn't burn myself
out, that five years later I can still present a variety of work.
   ``I think what keeps me less crazy _ because it's all relative _
is my life in the theater and going out on the stage night after
night after night and being dependent on concentration, a loyalty
to the play and a loyalty to my fellow actors, without whom you can
achieve nothing.
   ``Everything is collaborative,'' said Kingsley. ``I can't do
anything on my own. That I knew before I won the Academy Award. I
think that what gets jived up about the Academy Awards is how the
winners stand up and thank everybody. But it's true, it's true.
Nobody can achieve anything in my business on their own.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Exhibit Of Canada's Eccentric Musical Genius</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He wore a woolen scarf and gloves in summer and
lived like a hermit, communicating with the outside world by
telephone.
   But when Glenn Gould died of a stroke nine days after his 50th
birthday in 1982, Canada lost not only a notorious eccentric but
its greatest musician.
   For the first time since the pianist's death, an exhibition at
the National Library in Ottawa provides an intimate look at Gould's
life, from his checkered cloth cap to the room keys he collected at
hotels across the continent, including an entire set from New
York's Stanhope Hotel.
   Fortunately for posterity, Gould was a pack rat who set aside
one room of his apartment on Toronto's West St. Clair Avenue for
scores, scripts, letters, programs, souvenirs and assorted junk.
   ``He wrote everything down on pads. You can almost follow him
through each day,'' said Stephen Willis, head of the library's
music manuscript collection.
   A packing list reminds him to bring Valium and Librium for his
nerves, and a TV Guide. A 1966 commentary for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. says provocatively in red ball point,
``Sometimes it seems to me that Mozart has had a rather better
press than he deserves.''
   A letter from his grandmother recommends a mustard pack for his
sore back, while Gould commiserates with an ailing Leonard
Bernstein (``Dear Leonardo'') by offering some tips on
hypochondria. ``I have several titles for diseases which I am
expecting to have in later life but have not yet had occasion to
make use of.''
   After a piano technician dislocated his shoulder with a
backslap, Gould distributed a notice requesting that no one offer
to shake his hand. ``This will eliminate embarrassment all around.''
   Gould's international career had a sensational start. He was a
Canadian celebrity at 15. He landed a lucrative Columbia Records
contract the day after his New York debut in 1955, and the first of
more than 100 discs, Bach's Goldberg Variations, is still a classic.
   He suddenly abandoned the concert platform in 1964 in pursuit of
what he saw as a purer musical experience in the recording studio,
and eventually became his own producer, controlling a mixing board
the way a conductor directs an orchestra.
   He loved the microphone and dedicated much of his time to radio
and TV documentaries, including a ``Solitude Trilogy'' visitors can
sample by picking up a telephone and listening to Gould
philosophize about the Canadian North.
   A night owl, Gould rented a studio at Toronto's Inn on the Park
because it was the only place in town he could get something to eat
in the early hours, Willis said.
   The exhibit features Gould's favorite Steinway, his cluttered
pigeonhole desk and the rickety card table chair his father
modified as a piano stool. Gould preferred a low-slung chair so
that his fingers lay flat along the keyboard, the antithesis of the
pounding romantic style he abhorred.
   An animal lover, he left his worldly goods to the
animal-protecting Toronto Humane Society and Salvation Army. The
library was allowed to purchase the collection of 20,000 items,
packed in 226 boxes, on condition it organize an exhibit. The
display will tour Canada later this year and negotiations are under
way with U.S. and European museums.
   The most personal documents were withheld, but Willis said there
was evidence of ``two or three relationships'' with women that did
not last long.
   In retrospect, Gould's career is filled with irony. He searched
for musical clarity and control in what he termed the ``backbone''
of a score, and dismissed virtuoso playing and tonal beauty for its
own sake.
   However, he marred some recordings by humming along with the
music, a habit critics considered an affectation. ``Readers will
find the groans and croons intolerable,'' the Penguin Guide says of
one Bach recording.
   Gould preferred the piano to the harpsichord and played no part
in the rediscovery of original instruments and pitch that has
revolutionized baroque listening in the 1980s.
   He saw nothing wrong with splicing dozens of takes for one
definitive performance and envisioned an era when recordings,
adjusted electronically by home listeners, would entirely replace
public concerts.
   Yet even with today's digital compact discs, most performers and
listeners favor spontaneous complete takes and concert hall
acoustics.
   Despite reservations, Gould holds an Olympian place in Canadian
music.

   Holly Knight believes in the power of a good
song.
   ``If people like the artist but not the songs, they won't buy
the record,'' said Knight, who has written the hits ``Never'' for
Heart, ``Love Touch'' for Rod Stewart and ``Better Be Good to Me''
for Tina Turner.
   ``If you go to concerts, you can see the reactions of people
when they go into a song they like or know. They sing and dance and
go nuts. As soon as they recognize the hit, they stand up.''
   But after years of catapulting others to the limelight, Knight
is seeking some recognition of her own. She has just released her
debut album, ``Holly Knight,'' and is counting on the strength of
her writing to attract a following.
   ``I liked the songs so much that when I handed the record over
to the label, I really didn't mind what song they picked for the
single,'' she said.
   Knight grew up in New York wanting to be a rock star more than a
songwriter. She began playing music at age 4 and was performing
live as a teen-ager. Her talent as a songwriter emerged while she
was a member of the groups ``Spider'' and ``Device.''
   ``My songs were starting to be the singles and get more
attention. When I left the group (Device), I thought I'd write a
song here or there and give them to people,'' she said.
   Her first hit came in 1983 with ``Love Is a Battlefield,''
recorded by Pat Benatar. Knight does a softer version of the song
on her own album.
   ``I really like Patti's version of it. It gives people a chance
to see how you can take the same song and make it sound really
different,'' she said.
   Knight is pleased with all the interpretations of her songs,
pointing out that the demos were similar to the finished product.
She singled out Tina Turner for ``You Better Be Good to Me.''
   ``I think the vocal delivery really suited her; `Better Be Good
to Me' suited her. It suited her psychologically. I think she did
such a great job delivering it because she really meant it,''
Knight said.
   Her singing style is reminiscent of Dusty Springfield, best
known for such pop-soul songs as ``Son of a Preacher Man'' and ``I
Only Want to Be With You.'' Knight said she doesn't try to sound
like any of her favorite singers, but admires their approach.
   ``Daryl Hall. I was influenced by him. Aretha Franklin. A lot of
my favorite singers are great but not technically brilliant.''
   Knight co-produced her album with Chris Lord-Alge, who has
worked with Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Madonna and Stevie
Nicks.
   ``He (Lord-Alge) was very encouraging,'' she said. ``I purely
went on instinct with him. Everything he said was right along the
lines of what I was thinking.''
   The album has a lush pop sound and little over-dubbing was used.
   ``It's not 48 tracks,'' Knight said. ``I did try to get three
singers singing at once but I couldn't use any of it because it
sounded too big. It sounds rich because there isn't a lot of stuff
on there so it gives room for what's on there to breathe.''
   Still, songwriting is what Knight is known for, and the songs on
her album were worked on over a long period of time. ``I may take
months and months to write a song. I might work on it and then
leave it for a while and then go back to it.''
   Knight's writing is influenced by the Motown and Stax sounds of
the 1960s.
   ``I owned a Supremes record before I owned a Beatles record,''
she said. ``I'm doing some new songs now. On one part I wanted to
put horns on. The horns sounded really out of tune. They had that
Memphis Sound, lazy out-of-tune horns. I was responding to those
songs.''
   Anyone hoping to turn an unrecorded Knight song into a hit will
be disappointed: She is not prolific.
   ``I'm not the kind of writer that writes 40 songs and a few
become hits. Just about every song I write has become a hit,''
Knight said. ``I don't put a lot out there. In general, people call
me and want to know if I have a tune sitting around, and I really
don't.''
   Knight wants to tour, but will probably wait until next year.
She points out again how important it is for the audience to
recognize the songs.
   ``I'd like to have a couple of Top 10's so people will know some
of the music. It's going to be more exciting for them as well as me
if people know the music.
   ``It's down to that again: When you recognize a tune you dance
and get into it. It helps tide me over. People are very comfortable
with familiarity.''

   Thufferin' thuccotash!
   Mel, ah-say-Mel Blanc, the voice behind Bugs, Daffy, Tweety,
Porky, Woody and almost every cartoon character from here to
Cuc-amonga, is 80 years old and has just written an autobiography.
   Blanc, in a warm-hearted and fascinating new book, ``That's Not
All Folks: My Life in the Golden Age of Cartoons and Radio''
(Warner Books, $17.95) says Warner Bros. produced 1,003 cartoons,
and he voiced 848 of them.
   His favorite character? Reached by telephone at his Los Angeles
home, Blanc answered in the voice of Brooklyn's most famous bunny:
```Everybody knows who I am, doc. I don't cayuh where dey are or
who dey are. Even up in Mars dey know about me. HEHEHEHEH!'
   ``Bugs: that's my favorite character. I even have him tatooed on
my shirt.''
   The ``Looney Tunes'' and ``Merrie Melodies'' churned out by
Warner Bros. in a dank office dubbed Termite Terrace by Blanc and
his cartooning co-workers had their heydey from the 1930s to the
mid-'50s.
   Rerun countless times, they are arguably still the funniest
things on television. They parodied film stars from Humphrey Bogart
to Katharine Hepburn, tweaked politicians and contained salty,
hilarious characters that are a far cry from the phoney, unfunny
goody-goodies and baddy-baddies that populate today's junk-food TV
cartoon shows.
   The box-office success this summer of ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit,'' a mystery-fantasy in which cartoon characters must
contend with the human world, proves that the public still eats up
good animation.
   Blanc, in fact, did the voices of Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Bugs
Bunny and Sylvester the Cat in ``Roger Rabbit,'' but he says he
hasn't seen the film yet.
   Cartoon connoisseurs will find plenty of little known facts to
relish in Blanc's autobiography, co-written by Philip Bashe.
   Just a few samples:
   _ The theme music for Warner Bros. cartoons is a tune called
``The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.''
   _ Voice characterizations are done first, not the pictures, to
the surprise of many.
   _ A single six-minute Warner Bros. cartoon took four or five
artists sketching about 16,000 pictures and 60 backgrounds.
   _ Bugs Bunny in his earliest incarnation in the late '30s was
called ``Happy Rabbit.'' Blanc hated the name, and in 1940 he
changed it to Bugs. He decided to give him a tough-guy Brooklyn
accent, even though Blanc grew up in San Francisco and Portland,
Ore., and to this day has never set foot in Brooklyn.
   _ He may love Bugs, but Blanc hated raw carrots. He chewed them
for the sound effects, and filled trash cans with half-munched
carrots.
   _ The hardest voice characterization for Blanc was Yosemite Sam
since it had to be done at a constant holler. Sylvester was the
easiest because he sounded closest to Blanc's natural voice, except
for the exaggerated lisp.
   After the demise of Termite Terrace, Blanc went on to do more
modern cartoon characters made famous on TV, from Barney Rubble on
The Flintstones series, to the Frito Bandito.
   Blanc gained more fame than fortune from his cartoon
characterizations. The most Warner Bros. ever paid him for being
the voice behind their cartoons was $20,000.
   The only hint of bitterness in his autobiography is about the
way Warners copyrighted the voices of the cartoon characters Blanc
made famous. It means he can't publicly say, ``What's up, Doc?'' or
``I tawt I taw a puddy-tat'' or such phrases he invented without
getting the studio's permission.
   ``That is true,'' he said over the phone. ``I worked for them
and I did these voices, and they in turn copyrighted the voices and
trademarked them. I wanted to keep working for them, so I didn't
say anything. I was a jerk. I should have said something at the
time.''
   He did considerably better financially as a radio and TV
personality. For years on the Jack Benny program, he did the sound
effects for the wheezing old Maxwell that the skinflint comedian
supposedly drove. Most famous of all, he played the train depot
caller who broke up audiences with, ``Train leaving on track five
for Anaheim, Azusa and Cuc-amonga!''
   Blanc says at the end of his book that while he may not last
forever, he has plans to allow his cartoon characters to live on.
   ``A lot of people try to copy my voice, but there's only one guy
who can do my voice and make it actually make it sound like me, and
that's my son, Noel,'' he said.
   Age and the emphysema which forces him to use oxygen at night
have fortunately not impaired the gifted larynx of ``the man of a
thousand voices.'' Well, maybe he's down to a few hundred now.
   The thought of retiring is, as Daffy would say, deth-picable.
   ``You know, I don't think I'll ever stop until I'm dead,'' he
says. ``I have to have a driver now. He drives me to work, either
to Warner Bros. or one of the studios in town. I allow two hours
for them to record me. It never takes that much, because they still
call me `one take Blanc.'''

   Loney Hutchins gets his guitar out of the
case, sits at a table and begins singing a tune written by a lady
who's lucky to be alive:
   ``I could kiss your lips all night.
   ``Hold you in my arms with all my might.
   ``It's you who taught me
   ``The taste of love.''
   Across the table, Tammy Mitchem softly sings along with the

said.
   The 27-year-old woman from Gastonia, N.C., spent 2{ months in a
coma following a traffic accident in February 1987. While driving
to get horse feed, she was struck by a drunken driver in Bessemer
City, N.C.
   For the past 10 months she has participated in music therapy
under the direction of Hutchins, a singer-songwriter and former
associate of Johnny Cash.
   She is among about 25 people who once suffered severe head
injuries receiving individual and group music therapy from Hutchins
at Cedarbrook, a private treatment facility 40 miles northeast of
Nashville.
   ``These people could be vegetating without this facility,'' says
Hutchins.
   Patients start by listening to music, then graduate to singing
or composing. Some go on fieiew bear markets in a
favorable light.
   ``Remember, the only time you want stock prices to be at their
peak is the day you plan to sell. In the meantime, you should be
glad that the stock market periodically places its merchandise on
sale.''

   When Dr. Abraham N. Lieberman gives talks about
brain transplants, he flashes two faces on the screen: Albert
Einstein and Moe of the Three Stooges.
   People have gotten used to the idea of shifting kidneys, livers,
even hearts, from person to person. But the seat of intellect and
personality is unquestionably special.
   Despite his illustration of the differences, brain-wise, between
people, Lieberman says the organ is just as transferable as others.
   ``Brain is tissue, and it can be transplanted as tissue, the way
liver and kidney can,'' he says.
   Doctors aren't swapping whole brains, or even thinking seriously
about it. But they have taken the first tentative steps toward
transplanting small parts of brains, or related tissue from
elsewhere in the body or from fetuses, to cure the ills of the
body's most important and mysterious organ.
   Although such therapy has just begun, the ethical thickets
surrounding it are already being explored, mainly because of one
big and unresolved question: Where will the brains come from?
   Lieberman is a neurologist at New York University, where doctors
are trying to reverse Parkinson's disease by removing
chemical-producing tissue from the adrenal glands and implanting it
in the victims' brains.
   At Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, doctors have used a
similar approach to treating Huntington's disease.
   Some day brain transplants may control a variety of other
degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. For now,
most of the early testing is centered on Parkinson's, a reasonable
place to start. Unlike many other brain diseases, it is limited to
a small region of the brain, and its underlying complexities are
fairly well understood.
   It also is one of the most common brain diseases. Between
500,000 and 1 million Americans, including 2 percent of everyone
over 70, have Parkinson's. Once it was considered to be exclusively
a disease of the elderly, but it is being diagnosed increasingly in
younger people, even in their 20s and 30s.
   Parkinson's results from gradual destruction of a part of the
brain called the nigral tissue, which makes an essential
message-carrying chemical, dopamine.
   Victims often suffer tremors and have trouble controlling their
movements. Some find it hard to stand unaided and walk, if at all,
with short, shuffling steps. Patients may even be unable to hold
their heads erect.
   There is no cure. The disease is slowly progressive, although
its worst effects can be held off for a few years with levodopa and
other drugs.
   The goal of brain surgery is to replace the damaged tissue so
the brain will make its own dopamine again. There are several
sources of tissue: aborted fetuses, living organ donors, the dead
and the victim's own body.
   The most common approach in Parkinson's is to transfer
dopamine-making tissue from one place to another in the patient.
The adrenal glands, which lie above the kidneys, also produce
dopamine, so doctors implant adrenal tissue in the patient's brain.
   At a conference at the Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Dr. Peter McL. Black of Brigham and
Women's Hospital here said at least 11 U.S. medical centers have
performed this kind of operation on 70 people.
   ``It's not a miracle cure,'' he said. About half are better to
some degree, and 10 percent are convincingly improved.
   Lieberman said the most impressive of his 11 patients is a
doctor who could not walk or even stand before the surgery.
Although he is far from cured, he can walk unassisted, live alone
and go outside.
   The patient's wife left him before he got sick, but returned to
care for him when he began to deteriorate. After surgery, he
improved to the point that all the old animosities between them
returned, and she left again.
   Lieberman said the surgery is in such an early, crude stage that
doctors are unsure exactly what tissue to transplant, where to put
it or what it does.
   ``It's like we are giving bread mold to people and don't even
know what penicillin is,'' he said. ``That's the level we are at.''
   It is the only hope for some people who are going downhill and
no longer respond to medicine.
   But there are drawbacks beyond the mediocre results so far. It
is expensive: $30,000 to $100,000, depending on where the surgery
is done. And it is such a grueling procedure _ actually two major
operations on the abdomen and the head _ that many elderly
Parkinson's victims are simply too sick to stand it.
   Lieberman said one woman suffered 25 major complications,
including cardiac arrest, and was in the hospital seven months. ``I
can't tell you that she is any better than when she went into the
hospital, but she's not any worse.''
   To improve the outcome, doctors are considering other,
potentially better, tissue sources. One is adrenal glands from
young kidney donors. Another is fetuses.
   In January, Dr. Ignacio Madrazo and colleagues from La Raza
Medical Center in Mexico City said they obtained dramatic results
after transplanting brain and adrenal tissue from a spontaneously
aborted fetus into two Parkinson's victims. Earlier this month,
they said one of them had improved enough to go job hunting.
   Since then, the operation also has been done at the Midland
Center for Neurosurgery and Neurology in England. Researchers at
the University of Lund in Sweden, reported that after six months,
their first two patients showed no significant improvement.
   Some experts believe that in people, tissue from aborted fetuses
will work better than adrenal tissue from the patient's own body.
It would eliminate the need for surgery to gather the tissue, and
because it's so immature, it might adapt better to its new locale.
   Lund's Dr. Anders Bjorklund has experimented with rats that have
Parkinson's, which resolves when fetal tissue is implanted and
returns when it is removed. He has even successfully given them
human fetal tissue.
   However, a human needs far more fetal tissue, Bjorklund noted.
``There is a real problem of how to scale up the procedure. We
don't know if we can obtain enough material to do meaningful
trials'' in humans.
   Some biotechnology companies are looking for ways to mass
produce the fetal tissue in cell cultures.
   Animal studies suggest other possible uses for fetal brains.
When given to infertile mice that lack an essential hormone, the
animals became able to reproduce. Fetal brain tissue also improved
the memories of old rats.
   Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan of Brigham and Women's said he doesn't see
any overwhelming ethical barriers to transplanting tissue from
aborted human fetuses. ``What would bother people about this? It's
dead fetal tissue that is going to be thrown away anyway.''
   However, researchers at the National Institutes of Health have
been prohibited from using aborted fetal tissue in transplants
until an advisory committee can think through the ethical, medical
and legal issues involved.
   Some have worried that women might abort fetuses so the tissue
can be used in sick relatives, or might even sell their fetuses for
medical use.
   However, Ryan said he believes that such excesses can be
avoided. ``I always believe we can draw the line and say, `We will
use it this way.'''

<HEAD>Wide Differences in Child Diabetes Risk Highlight Basic Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children in Rochester, Minn., are about twice as
likely to get the most serious form of diabetes as those in San
Diego or Alabama but face only two-thirds the risk of Finnish
children, according to new research.
   The risk of insulin-dependent diabetes unexplainably varies
17-fold across 14 nations studied, running generally higher in
cooler climates.
   Scientists are studying such differences for clues to a far more
basic question: Just what causes insulin-dependent diabetes?
   The disease occurs because the insulin-producing cells of the
pancreas have been destroyed by a misguided attack by the body's
immune system. The 1 million Americans with it must inject
themselves with insulin every day to stay alive. Otherwise, sugar
will build up in their blood and cause such complications as heart
and kidney disease, blindness and nerve damage.
   Genes clearly play a key role in triggering the immune system's
attack. The vast majority of people who develop insulin-dependent
diabetes have particular genes linked to the disease.
   However, most people with the susceptible genetic background do
not develop diabetes, and the geographic variation in rates is
evidence of an environmental role, said Ronald LaPorte, associate
professor in the epidemiology department at the University of
Pittsburgh.
   Studies also suggest that rates for American children younger
than 15 more than doubled from 1947 to 1976, which argues for a
change in the environment, said James Warram of the Joslin Diabetes
Center in Boston.
   What could this environmental factor be?
   Viral infections are one theory, since viruses show seasonal and
temperature preferences as does insulin-dependent diabetes. Diet is
another proposed trigger, with some support from animal studies.
   The question is complicated because the immune system starts
attacking the pancreas years before a person shows diabetes
symptoms. So any trigger must have acted at some unknown time in
the past, said Jerome I. Rotter of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles.
   Rotter also said much of the geographic difference in rates may
be due to differing prevalence of the susceptibility genes in
various populations, rather than just environmental causes.
   Geographic differences are highlighted in a new study by an
international team of scientists who compared insulin-dependent
diabetes rates in children under age 15 from 14 countries. Their
work appears in the August issue of the journal Diabetes.
   Rates ranged from 1.7 cases per 100,000 ``person-years'' in
Hokkaido, Japan, to 29.5 cases per 100,000 person-years in Finland.
A person-year is like a man-hour; it represents the equivalent of
following one person for one year.
   Within the United States, the rates per 100,000 person-years
also showed variation: 9.4 in San Diego, 11.4 in Jefferson County,
Ala., 13.4 in Allegheny County, Penn., 15.1 in Colorado, 17.8 in
North Dakota and 20.8 in Rochester.
   The study's overall variation was most pronounced for children
younger than 5, suggesting the unknown environmental agent may
exert more influence in that population, said LaPorte. ``It seems
to be affecting the youngest children the most, whatever it is.''

<TEXT>
   A voluntary monitoring program by test-tube baby
clinics may help infertile couples avoid those that misrepresent
their success.
   More than 3,000 test-tube babies have been born in the United
since the world's first, Louise Brown, was born 10 years ago in
England.
   Yet the success rate remains low.
   Only 17 percent of attempts led to pregnancies in 1986, the
latest year for which figures are available through the monitoring
program operated under the auspices of the Society for Assisted
Reproductive Technology and its parent organization, the American
Fertility Society.
   And the odds are that a quarter of those pregnancies didn't
succeed, says Dr. Martin Quigley of the Cleveland Clinic
Foundation, vice president of SART, whose members are doctors
practicing in vitro fertilization and related techniques.
   The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment reported in
June that at least half of the nation's approximately 170 test-tube
baby clinics have never sent a woman home with a baby. Congress is
considering whether it should require individual clinics to release
their success rates.
   ``There tends to be an exaggeration of the success rate,'' says
Quigley. Clinics can count very early pregnancies as successes, for
example, even though at least half will not result in a baby, he
says.
   The stakes are high: A single in vitro fertilization attempt
costs $4,000 to $6,000, and many couples try several times.
   Infertile couples who know what to ask can avoid being taken in
by a clinic's inflated statistics, says Dr. Alan DeCherney,
president of the SART.
   The right questions are: How many cycles (fertilization
attempts) has the clinic done? How many live babies has it
produced? What is the success rate per cycle? How do they deal with
various forms of infertility?
   The most reliable statistic is the number of clinical
pregnancies _ those that produce a missed period _ per number of
attempts, says DeCherney, director of the test-tube baby clinic at
Yale University in New Haven, Conn.
   Clinics that do more in vitro fertilizations, as represented by
the number of cycles they've done, generally are more successful
than newer, smaller clinics, DeCherney says.
   The monitoring program, in which about 115 clinics participate,
doesn't provide information on individual clinics but does give
national figures. And a clinic's voluntary membership means it has
met certain standards and serves as a check on the accuracy of its
success rate.
   ``If I see a discrepancy in success rates, pregnancy or live
births, you can believe that I'm going to raise a question,'' says
Stuart Hartz of Medical Research International in Burlington,
Mass., who directs the program.
   Ann Petter, executive director of Resolve, Inc., in Arlington,
Mass., a national advocacy organization for infertile couples, says
in vitro fertilization should be a last resort.
   ``It's gotten so much publicity and so much glamor that people
are leaping to thinking it's the solution, whereas there are a lot
of other things they could do first,'' Petter says.
   She recommends that couples unable to have children first get a
complete infertility workup to determine the cause of their
infertility.
   Resolve runs a referral service with names of infertility
experts across the country, and distributes information on
infertility and the procedures to correct it, including in vitro
fertilization.

<HEAD>Transplant, Grafting Techniques Could Help Against Brain Ailments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors aren't swapping brains, or even thinking
seriously about it, but they've taken steps toward transplanting
parts of brains, or tissue from the body or fetuses to cure the
body's most important organ.
   The ethical thickets surrounding it also are being explored,
mainly one big question: Where will the brains come from?
   At New York University, doctors are trying to reverse
Parkinson's disease by implanting tissue from adrenal glands into
the victims' brains. Doctors at Vanderbilt University use a similar
approach to treating Huntington's disease.
   For now, most of the testing is centered on Parkinson's, which
affects up to 1 million Americans and results from destruction of
part of the brain called the nigral tissue, which makes a
message-carrying chemical, dopamine.
   At least 11 U.S. medical centers have tried transplanting
dopamine-producing tissue from somewhere else in the body to the
brain in 70 people, said Dr. Peter McL. Black of Brigham and
Women's Hospital. About half are better to some degree, and 10
percent are convincingly improved.
   Dr. Abraham N. Lieberman, an NYU neurologist, said the most
impressive of his 11 patients is a doctor who couldn't walk or even
stand before surgery. He is far from cured, but can walk
unassisted, live alone and go outside.
   The surgery costs $30,000 to $100,000, and many elderly
Parkinson's patients are too sick to stand the two major operations
on the abdomen and head that are required. To improve the outcome,
doctors are considering using adrenal glands from young kidney
donors, or from fetuses.
   Some success using tissue from spontaneously aborted fetuses has
been reported by Dr. Ignacio Madrazo and colleagues at La Raza
Medical Center in Mexico City. Dr. Anders Bjorklund at the
University of Lund in Sweden has had success in rats with
Parkinson's, but notes that a human needs far more tissue.
   Some biotechnology companies also are looking for ways to mass
produce the fetal tissue in cell cultures.
   Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan of Brigham and Women's said he doesn't see
any ethical barriers to transplanting tissue from aborted fetuses.
However, researchers at the National Institutes of Health have been
prohibited from using aborted fetal tissue in transplants until an
advisory committee can rule on the issues.
   Some have worried that women might abort fetuses so the tissue
can be used in relatives, or might even sell their fetuses. Ryan
said he believes such excesses can be avoided.

<HEAD>Wide Differences in Child Diabetes Risk Highlight Basic Mystery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children in Rochester, Minn., are about twice as
likely to get the most serious form of diabetes as those in San
Diego or Alabama but face only two-thirds the risk of Finnish
children, according to new research.
   The risk of insulin-dependent diabetes unexplainably varies
17-fold across 14 nations studied, running generally higher in
cooler climates. Scientists are studying such differences for clues
to a far more basic question: Just what causes insulin-dependent
diabetes?
   The disease occurs because the insulin-producing cells of the
pancreas have been destroyed by a misguided attack by the body's
immune system. The 1 million Americans with it must inject
themselves with insulin every day to stay alive.
   Genes clearly play a key role in triggering the immune system's
attack, but most people with the susceptible genetic background do
not develop diabetes, and the geographic variation in rates is
evidence of an environmental role, said Ronald LaPorte, an
epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh.
   A new study, reported in the August issue of the journal
diabetes, compared insulin-dependent diabetes rates in children
under age 15 from 14 countries.
   Rates ranged from 1.7 cases per 100,000 ``person-years'' in
Hokkaido, Japan, to 29.5 cases per 100,000 person-years in Finland.
A person-year is like a man-hour; it represents the equivalent of
following one person for one year.
   Within the United States, the rates also showed variation: 9.4
in San Diego, 11.4 in Jefferson County, Ala., 13.4 in Allegheny
County, Penn., 15.1 in Colorado, 17.8 in North Dakota and 20.8 in
Rochester.

<HEAD>Help Available For Choosing A Test-Tube Baby Clinic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A voluntary monitoring program by test-tube baby
clinics may help infertile couples avoid those that misrepresent
their success.
   Only 17 percent of attempts led to pregnancies in 1986, the
latest year for which figures are available through the monitoring,
and Dr. Martin Quigley of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, vice
president of the Society for Assisted Reproduction Technology, said
odds are a quarter of those didn't succeed.

   A massive vaccination drive launched by the World
Health Organization in May could rid most of the world of polio by
1995 _ five years ahead of the WHO's target for global eradication,
an official says.
   However, that will still leave desperately poor countries whose
``basic vaccine delivery system has to be brought up to speed,''
said Dr. Ralph Henderson, director of the WHO's Expanded Program on
Immunization.
   About 120 countries with a total population of 4.1 billion are
to be included in the vaccination drive. Only 56 percent of
children are immunized against polio in the Third World, where it
is the main cause of lameness.
   More work will be needed, Henderson said, in about 20 countries
including Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia and several in Africa. Some
800 million people live in areas where less than half the
population is immunized.
   The annual cost of fighting polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping
cough, tetanus and tuberculosis is $150 million, and WHO expects to
need another $100 million to $500 million over the next decade just
for the polio campaign.
   The effort is due to be reviewed in December, Henderson said.
   Some 275,000 youngsters catch the disease every year, mostly in
poor countries, for lack of immunization that costs 10 U.S. cents.
The virus attacks the central nervous system in severe cases,
causing paralysis. One paralyzed child out of 10 dies and most of
the rest are affected for life.
   Past Third World drives make WHO believe most countries will be
polio-free by 1995, Henderson said. The anti-smallpox drive a
decade ago gives ``enormous inspiration and many, many lessons''
for the polio effort, but breaking the polio chain of transmission
will be ``much more difficult,'' he said.
   Infected people are highly contagious for three weeks, but only
one case in 100 is strong enough to be diagnosed. And while
smallpox requires close contact to catch, polio can be transmitted
through polluted food and water.

   The dollar rose swiftly in European trading this
morning, recovering last week's losses. Gold prices were lower in
quiet trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers said there was no central bank
intervention in early trading but they predicted another round of
concerted intervention this week to curb the dollar's rise.
   Traders in Italy said the market wasn't being led by hard
economic facts or news, but by statements from public officials and
a gut feeling that the Reagan administration wants a strong dollar
to help the presidential candidacy of George Bush.
   ``This is a market led by declarations. (U.S. Secretary of
Commerce William) Verity says one thing, the White House another,
and the market reacts accordingly,'' said a senior dealer in Milan.
   Verity's statement last week that a lower dollar is needed if
the U.S. is to right its massive trade imbalance had triggered a
fall in the U.S. currency.
   One dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said the dollar's
recovery and current strength raised the chances that the Deutsche
Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, will raise its discount
rate at a meeting on Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.48 yen to a closing 133.88 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 133.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.9137 West German marks, up from 1.8925; 1.6092
Swiss francs, up from 1.5915; 6.4835 French francs, up from 6.4125;
2.1615 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1390; 1,416.25 Italian lire, up

   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6860 from $1.7025 bid
late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $432.25 a troy ounce, up
from $432.00 bid late Friday. But at midmorning today, the city's

Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.61 to close at $432.01

   Dealers said the yen-dollar exchange rate appeared to be stuck

<TEXT>
   Although some complained about the lack
of a salary hike, United Steelworkers members at Lukens Steel Co.
approved a three-year contract that includes $2,400 in bonuses and
a new profit sharing program.
   Negotiators for Local 1165 and Lukens reached a tentative
agreement Thursday, just hours before the 1,400 USW members planned
to start manning picke lines. On Saturday, members voted 617-451 to
approve the contract.
   ``A lot of guys don't like it,'' steelworker Jack Entrekin said
after the agreement was explained to members. ``Of course, how they
talk and how they vote are two different things.''
   A number of union members were upset at the apparent trade-off
of profit sharing for a straight hourly raise because Lukens has
earned substantial profits in the past year, officials said.
   Last year's earnings of $46.6 million were more than double the
previous year's figure.
   ``I voted against it,'' said Edward Stanley, who has worked at
the mill since 1965. ``Slavery days are over.''
   In addition to the bonuses and profit sharing, the agreement
calls for better medical and insurance benefits, according to union
officials.
   The first profit-sharing plan for hourly employees would pay
steelworkers an extra 89 cents an hour based on company earnings
for the first six months of 1988, union officials said.
   Lukens steelworkers earn an average of $30,000 a year, according
to the company.
   John Washington, a crane operator, said he wanted to see an
across-the-board raise.
   ``We don't know what the steel industry is going to do,''
Washington said. ``The bottom could drop out tomorrow.''
   Harry Haines, president of Local 1165, said Lukens strongly
opposed a straight hourly wage increase because it automatically
would raise the company's costs for benefits and overtime.
   He shared the feelings of some union members who turned thumbs
down while walking in the rain to vote at the union hall Saturday.
   ``We told them we couldn't endorse it,'' Haines said. ``It was
our best effort, but not the company's.''
   Haines said the agreement provides for a $1,000 signing bonus,
to be paid in September. Workers also will receive bonuses of $800
and $600 in the second and third years of the contract.
   The bonuses are guaranteed, although payments in the final two
years would be deducted from any profit-sharing the workers earn.
   W.R. Wilson, chairman and president of Lukens Inc., the steel
company's parent firm, said it was his ``expectation and hope that
the steelworkers will do very well under the profit-sharing plan.''
   The union had worked under an extended contract since September
1986 but canceled the extension last week.

<HEAD>Australia, United States to Expand Airline Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After two and a half years of
negotiations, the governments of Australia and the United States
have agreed to expand airline service between the two countries.
   An agreement signed over the weekend allows U.S. airlines to fly
to Brisbane, Cairns and one other Australian city, to be chosen by
the United States, and then fly on to eight other Australian
destinations.
   The two U.S. carriers serving Australia, Continental Airlines
and United Airlines, currently can fly to four Australian cities.
   Under the new agreement, U.S. airlines also are allowed to apply
for service linking the United States and two Australian cities via
Japan. Australia's government-owned carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd.,
can fly to 15 U.S. cities, compared with the four it now serves.
The destinations will be chosen by Qantas.
   Qantas also can fly from the United States to Canada, and will
later be able to fly from the United States to Europe without the
restrictions it currently faces.
   Houston-based Continental said it will increase the number of
weekly flights out of Australia to 19 from the current 16 by the
end of October, and add another three flights to the United States
by April.
   United, the largest U.S. carrier, has not announced any proposed
changes. The airline's manager for Australia, Michael Merlini, said
that prior to the agreement Chicago-based United already had
planned to increase the number of weekly flights from Australia to
the United States to 14 from eight.
   Qantas and the U.S. airlines also are expected to take advantage
of the expansion through ``codesharing,'' or using a local airline
to book passengers on a through flight, according to a statement by
Gareth Evans, Australia's minister for transport and communications.
   Under the agreement, both the U.S. airlines and Qantas can
operate on a new route between Guam and Australia.
   An existing route between Australia and the United States via
the North Pacific, currently open only to U.S. airlines, will also
be opened to Qantas.
   The agreement also allows for automatic approval of capacity
increases in line with growth in passenger traffic.
   Continental said in a statement it plans to expand its Honolulu
hub and inaugurate three weekly DC-10 flights between Sydney,
Brisbane and Guam starting next April 1.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising sea levels caused by the world's
warming will have ``catastrophic'' effects on many small Pacific
islands and some may vanish underwater, an international congress
of scientists was told Monday.
   The impact of the so-called ``greenhouse effect'' was one of
many problems highlighted on the opening day of the 26th Congress
of the International Geographic Union.
   The week-long meeting of 1,200 scientists from 55 countries is
the largest ever held in the southern hemisphere. The last congress
was held in Paris four years ago. Organizers said that more than
700 scientific papers would be presented this week.
   Scientists said the build-up of man-made gases will cause sea
levels to rise by about one meter (3.3 feet) within a century,
swamping many low-lying coral atolls such as Kiribati _ formerly
the Gilbert Islands _ and Tuvalu. The two nations have a combined
population of about 68,000.
   Also at risk are the Maldives in the Indian Ocean as well as the
Marshall Islands and Tokelau in the Pacific Ocean, said a paper
presented by Peter Roy and John Connell, of Australia's Department
of Mineral Resources and Sydney University's Department of
Geography, respectively.
   ``The experience will be catastrophic for some people,'' said
Roy.
   Not only would there be very little higher ground for the
population to retreat to but fresh water on the islands was likely
to dry up, destroying the ecology, he said.
   The scientists suggested immediate attention be given to
engineering works to keep the sea at bay.
   ``Increased migration, to high islands and overseas, is the
single most probable outcome of rising sea levels,'' the congress
was told. ``Some of the most recently populated islands are likely
to be depopulated, and even abandoned, as a new class of
`environmental refugee' is superimposed on that of `economic
refugee.'''
   Brian walker, chief ecologist of the Australian government's
main science body _ the commonwealth, science and industrial
research organization _cautioned there would be some beneficial
effects to the widely held prediction of catastrophe.
   ``For example, ice-free sea lanes have an impact,'' Walker said,
in an interview. ``The fact is there will be a great deal of change
but I'm not saying it will be predominantly bad.''
   However, Canadian geographer Dr. Roger Tomlinson of Ottowa said
a major task was to compile a data bank of existing knowledge about
changes that are likely to occur.
   ``It is a gargantuan task,'' he told the Associated Press. ``We
would need a computer 40,000 times more powerful than anything that
exists now. To understand the impact on humans is not going to be
easy. Just to put the information down on paper would stand some 60
miles (96 kilometers) high.''
   Meanwhile, Prof. Nicholas Polunin, of the World Council for
Biosphere in Geneva, Switzerland, said the world is reeling under
at least 20 identified menaces _ the worst of which is too many
people.
   He said the threats range from overpopulation and nuclear
holocaust to destruction of the ozone shield and human epidemics
such as aids.
   ``Yet basic to the vast majority is the problem of human
overpopulation, which in various ways is strangling the world,'' he
said.
   Polunin said the threat of nuclear warfare, a nuclear ``winter''
and nuclear accidents was the number one horror which could bring
life to a standstill with littls hope of ever recovering, while
destruction of the stratospheric ozone shield, which filters off
most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, already was
resulting in increased skin-cancers.
   Other menaces, according to Polunin, include the greenhouse
effect _ global warming due to the increasing buildup of carbon
dioxide, methane and other trace gases _ as well as deforestation,
devegetation and desertification, depletion of raw materials,
insufficient agricultural land, sea-level rising through floods,
widespread excessive pollutions, and climatic variations.

<HEAD>Wickes Agrees To $598 Million Management-Led Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wickes Cos. plans to sell itself in
a deal valued at nearly $2.6 billion to a management group headed
by chairman Sanford Sigoloff, who led the retailing giant out of
bankruptcy three years ago.
   The $12 per-share offer announced Sunday is nearly $3 higher
than Wickes' closing stock price of $9.37{ Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange. It appeared to reflect Sigoloff's frustration at
failing to boost the company's stock price and profits through a
restructuring-and-acquisition strategy.
   Based in Santa Monica, Wickes is one of the largest suppliers to
the automobile industry, the world's biggest producer of wall
coverings and major retailer of home improvement products.
   W-II Holdings Corp., a firm Sigoloff established with members of
his management team, will offer to purchase nearly 40 million of
Wickes' 49.8 million shares, as well as assume its debt of $2.06
billion. The deal values Wickes at nearly $2.6 billion.
   But Sigoloff said in a statement that the agreement was
structured in such a way that higher offers from other potential
bidders were still possible.
   ``While we believe that our offer is fair, both management and
the board want to ensure that the company's shareholders obtain the
best price for their shares,'' Sigoloff said in a prepared
statement.
   The offer was publicized in conjunction with an announcement
that Wickes lost $12.4 million for the second quarter ending July
30, compared with earnings of $18.9 million a year earlier.
   The major participants in W-II Holdings will be institutional
investors, including the Wall Street firm Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., which will arrange much of the financing, Wickes spokesman
Michael Sitrick said.
   In 1982, Wickes became what was then the largest U.S. company to
file for bankruptcy protection, blaming the move on an excessive
debt load, deteriorating relationships with creditors and declining
profits.
   About three years later, the giant retailer was back on its feet
after selling 13 of its 32 divisions and winning creditor approval
for a plan allowing Wickes to emerge from bankruptcy court.
   The force behind the comeback was Sigoloff, who earned the
nickname ``Ming the Merciless'' for the tough-minded business moves
and hard-nosed cost cutting.
   With a reputation for working up to 16 hours a day, Sigoloff got
a break when Wickes' creditors allowed him to pay off $1.21 billion
in debt with $289 million in cash, $524 million in debt securities
and an 82{ percent share of the reorganized company.
   Part of the company's post-bankruptcy struggle has been blamed
on Sigoloff's strategy of issuing more debt to raise cash for other
acquisitions, some of which ended in costly failure.
   In April 1986, for example, Wickes bid more than $1.2 billion
for the National Gypsum Co., a Dallas-based building supplier. The
bid collapsed when National Gypsum was acquired by its management.
   Wickes also failed in a $2.1 billion hostile bid for the
Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., and a $1.7 billion bid for Lear
Siegler Inc., an aerospace and automotive equipment concern.

<HEAD>Khashoggi To Repay Triad America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi tycoon Adnan Khashoggi has agreed to
pay up to $35 million to Triad America Corp., his bankrupt U.S.
holding company, under a tentative settlement reached by attorneys
and trustees, a newspaper reported.
   Danny Kelly, an attorney for Triad America trustee R. Todd
Neilson, declined to comment on the size of the settlement, but
anonymous sources quoted in the Salt Lake Tribune Monday said the
amount was $30 million to $35 million.
   ``I think it is the best settlement we could have gotten, and I
don't think there was any money left on the table,'' Neilson was
quoted as saying.
   ``I'm basically pleased we were able to secure this money. We
started this estate without a single dollar in it, and we will end
up with millions of dollars to pay creditors,'' he added.
   Triad America, a holding company of Khashoggi and his brother
Essam, and eight affiliated companies filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in January 1987, listing
liabilities of $197.5 million and assets of $9.5 million.
   The tentative settlement, reached Friday after a day of
negotiations and subject to approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
would allow unsecured creditors to be paid 40 to 50 cents on the
dollar, barring any unforeseen complications, Kelly said.
   Triad America's major unsecured creditors include Sheraton
Corp., Texaco Inc., and the Department of Energy. In addition, 20
other unsecured creditors have claims of more than $1 million,
Kelly said.
   He estimated Triad's and its affiliates' debt to creditors at
$50 million to $75 million.
   ``We are not done looking for other money to repay creditors,''
Kelly said. ``There are potentially other sources of money to
enhance this. This still is not in a bank account in Utah, and a
lot of things still could happen.''
   Kelly said the trustee must satisfy certain conditions before
Khashoggi is obligated to pay the money, but he would not comment
on those conditions.
   The $30 million to $35 million would go to the bankruptcy estate
of Triad America.
   ``The trustee's intent ideally would be to get an interim
distribution to creditors as soon as possible,'' Kelly said. But
the bankruptcy court first must determine which creditors have
legitimate claims.
   ``It still could be years before the case is actually closed and
final payments are made,'' he said.
   The tentative agreement would settle a lawsuit filed against the
Khashoggi brothers by Neilson in October 1987. The suit, which also
named more than 40 companies directly or indirectly owned by the
pair, sought $239 million in actual damages and $800 million in
punitive damages for breach of contractual obligations and
fiduciary duties.
   Adnan Khashoggi indirectly owns 80 percent of Triad America,
while Essam Khashoggi indirectly owns 20 percent of the company.
   Triad America obtained a court order freezing the Khashoggis'
assets in the United States and attaching specific U.S. assets,
including a $51.5 million judgment against Northrop Corp.
   The order, said Neilson, was ``clearly what brought them to the
table.'' The company's lien on the judgment will be released ``the
minute the money hits our account,'' he said.
   The judgment against Northrop, the Los Angeles-based aircraft
and arms manufacturer, stemmed from commissions on sales to the
Saudi air force and interest.
   Northrop has been in litigation with Adnan Khashoggi over the
commissions for years. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an
appeal by Northrop last year. But Kelly said, ``Northrop still had
some alternatives and theoretically could have tried to get out
from the judgment.''
   The Triad America settlement follows negotiations over a
tentative settlement with Northrop, in which the company would pay
$48.5 million. But Dan Berman, Khashoggi's local attorney, said the
two agreements were not connected.

   Stock prices were narrowly mixed today after
pulling back last week.
   The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which fell 21.52 last
week, was up 1.07 at 2,017.07 after 30 minutes of trading.
   But declining issues held a narrow lead over gainers among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 392 up, 436 down
and 486 unchanged in the early going.
   Big Board volume came to 20.49 million shares as of 10 a.m. on
Wall Street.
   Trading volume has been sluggish as investors have looked for
evidence about the direction of the economy and prospects for
inflation and interest rates.
   The economic indicators have been generally strong, but that has
inspired concerns about a resurgence of inflation.
   Interest rates have been rising in the wake of the Federal
Reserve's boost in the discount rate earlier this month.
   The Fed said in boosting its lending rate for member financial
institutions to 6.5 percent from 6 percent that it wanted to head
off inflation.
   But rising rates have raised some concerns that the central bank
could be pushing the economy toward a recession.
   Among the actively traded issues today, Philadelphia Electric
was up [ at 18, Kansas City Power and Light was up [ at 29} and
Exxon was down [ at 45|.
   The NYSE index was off 0.01 at 147.53. At the American Stock
Exchange, the composite market index was off 0.34 at 294.69.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.03 points to
2,016.00.
   In composite NYSE trading, gaining issues outnumbered declines
by about 4-to-3, with 794 up, 624 down and 522 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 122.37 million shares, against 139.82
million in the previous session.

   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita will leave
Friday for a six-day visit to China where he will sign a treaty on
investment protection that has been in the works for seven years,
officials said.
   Takeshita also will hold separate meetings with China's four top
leaders on his first visit as prime minister to Japan's giant
communist neighbor.
   ``We place special significance on this visit, on the 10th
anniversary of the signing of the Japan-China treaty of peace and
friendship,'' a senior Foreign Ministry official said Monday.
``Takeshita will review the last 10 years and discuss the future
with his Chinese counterparts.''
   The Japanese premier is to hold his main talks with Chinese
Premier Li Peng on the first day of his visit, which begins in
Beijing. He also will meet separately with President Yang Shangkun,
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   The visit comes at a time of relative calm in relations between
the two countries, once wartime adversaries.
   Takeshita's visit will ``further economic cooperation, and the
prime minister will confirm Japan's policy to support China's
modernization course,'' said a Japanese diplomat, who spoke on
condition he not be named.
   The investment protection accord was reached after the Beijing
government was persuaded to grant ``national status'' to Japanese
companies investing in China, the Foreign Ministry official said.
Such status means Japanese investors will be allowed the same tax
and other benefits accorded to Chinese enterprises.
   Takeshita will pledge a third round of Japanese yen credits to
begin in 1990 in an amount still to be decided, the official said.
   Foreign Ministry sources have suggested that the ceiling for the
loan package will be about 800 billion yen, or around $6 billion.
The current ceiling on Japanese loans to China is 470 billion yen,
or some $3.5 billion. The loans are for hydroelectric power and
other major development projects.
   Trade between the two countries has moved into China's favor in
the last three years. In 1985 Japan's surplus with China was $5
billion, but after the first six months of this year China is in
the black by $500 million in a bilateral trade worth $8.6 billion.
   China is Japan's fifth-largest trading partner while Japan is
China's no. 2 trading partner.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. both reported record first-half earnings,
which were boosted partly by merger and acquisition and merchant
banking fees, the securities firms said Monday.
   The record performances came despite a slump in many sectors of
the securities business that pushed profits at several other firms
sharply lower.
   Prudential-Bache had profits of $92 million after taxes in the
first six months, compared with $3 million in the year-ago period.
Earnings in the 1987 period were reduced by more than $30 million
as a result of the discontinuation of the firm's international
trade finance subisidiary, a spokesman said.
   In the merchant banking department, Hachette SA's purchase of
Diamandis Communications Inc. contributed more than $20 million to
Prudential-Bache's first-half profit, a spokesman said.
   Prudential-Bache officials noted that beefing up investment
banking operations at the largely retail-oriented brokerage firm is
paying off.
   The company is a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America,
based in Newark, N.J.
   Donaldson Lufkin, part of Equitable Life Assurance Society of
the U.S., had profits of $33 million before taxes, compared with
$17 million a year earlier.
   John S. Chalsty, the firm's chief executive officer, attributed
the gains in part to merchant banking activity. He also noted that
the firm managed to avoid trading losses.
   Neither Prudential Insurance nor Equitable, both mutual
insurance companies, report the earnings of their brokerage units
publicly.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States slipped by three to total 937, marking the second
consecutive week of slight declines, Baker Hughes Inc. reports.
   In last week's tally, the rig count dropped by five to total
940. A year ago this week, the count was 1,012, the company said
Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states Oklahoma posted the biggest
gain for the week with 10 additional working rigs, followed by
Texas with a gain of three and California, Kansas and North Dakota
with one each.
   New Mexico led declines for the second straight week with 11,
followed by Louisiana, nine; Wyoming, six; Michigan, five; Ohio,
two; and Colorado, one. Pennsylvania's total was unchanged for the
week.

<HEAD>Chrysler's Canadian Branch Won't Recall Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian government cannot make Chrysler Corp.
recall 120,000 cars that may violate pollution laws even though the
company recalled 492,000 cars for a similar reason in the United
States, officials said.
   Chrysler cars built between 1986 and early 1987 with 2.2-litre
and 2.5-litre engines were recalled in the United States in April
1987 because a flawed fuel injector caused some cars to emit black
smoke, which violated American pollution laws.
   But Canadian authorities cannot force a similar recall because,
until September 1987, Canadian emission laws were far less
stringent than those in the United States, according to Chrysler's
Canadian subsidiary, which has refused a request by Transport
Canada to recall the cars.
   ``We met with Chrysler in July,'' says David Gourley of the
department's energy emissions branch. ``But they said there was no
reason to recall the cars because they met Canadian standards at
the time (the cars were sold).''
   A Chrysler Canada Ltd. spokesman said Friday the company can't
afford to recall old cars to comply with new laws.
   ``Where would you draw the line on something like that, 1902?''
the spokesman asked.
   Most Chrysler K-cars, including Plymouth Reliants and Dodge
Aries, were among the models recalled in the United States.
   Canadian emission-control laws for passenger cars were changed
in September to meet standards the United States has used since
1981.
   Chrysler extended its fuel-injector warranty on the questioned
models to 80,000 kilometres from 20,000 kilometres in February.
   In the meantime, Gourley says the only way to force Chrysler to
recall the cars is to take the automaker to court, where his branch
would need ``a smoking gun...a smoking Chrysler'' to win its case.

<HEAD>Open Software Foundation Picks Cambridge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $100 million computer software consortium said
today it will locate in Cambridge.
   The Open Software Foundation was created in May with the backing
of Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Apollo Computer
Inc., International Business Machines Corp. and other major
computer companies.
   The intention of the consortium is to develop a version of the
Unix operating system that is independent of control by American
Telephone & Telegraph Co., the creator of Unix. The standard could
run on a variety of different computers.
   The consortium, temporarily located in Lawrence, said it chose
Cambridge after a three-month search of sites across the country,
including Washington; Pittsburgh; Austin, Texas; and California's
Silicon Valley.
   Henry Crouse, president of the Open Software Foundation, said
the presence of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Harvard University were factors in the choice.
   ``It is situated in one of the country's premier high technology
and business regions, allowing us to attract top talent. It is
close to MIT, Harvard and other academic institutions pioneering
the development of advanced systems technology.
   ``Finally, it offers unique proximity to an international
airport, with central and timely access to both the West Coast and
Europe,'' Crouse said in a prepared statement.
   The Open Software Foundation has 75 employees but expects to
grow to 200 by year's end and 250 in 1989, according to spokeswoman
Paula Slotkin.
   OSF, a non-profit organization, was founded as a move against
the control by AT&T of the UNIX software standard. The original
members of the consortium, besides Digital, Apollo, Hewlett-Packard
and IBM, included three European companies, West Germany's Nixdorf
Computer and Siemens AG and France's Groupe Bull.
   Since then, they have been joined by Phillips of the
Netherlands, Adobe Systems, Altos Computer Systems, Mitre Corp.,
Stratus Computer, Italy's Tecsiel SpA, and Toshiba America Inc.
   Alex Morrow, director of strategic relations for the consortium,
said it plans to introduce its key product, a new open software

   The stock market pulled back broadly this
morning, taking its cue from rising rates in the credit market.
   The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which fell 11.03 on
Friday and 21.52 for the week, was off 6.75 at 2,009.25 after 90
minutes of trading.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 8 to 3 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 327 up, 799 down
and 516 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 42.33 million shares as of 11 a.m. on
Wall Street.
   Trading volume has been sluggish in recent days as investors
have looked for more evidence about the direction of the economy
and prospects for inflation and interest rates.
   The economic indicators have been generally strong, but that has
inspired concerns about a resurgence of inflation.
   Later this week, the government plans to report on consumer
prices in July and second-quarter economic growth.
   Interest rates have been rising in the wake of the Federal
Reserve's boost in the discount rate earlier this month.
   Today, yields on the closely-watched 30-year Treasury bond edged
up past the 9.40 percent mark after finishing below that level last
week.
   Among the actively traded blue-chip issues today, American
Telephone & Telegraph was off { at 24\, Ford was down 1 at 47| and
General Electric was down [ at 39|.
   Wickes jumped 3\ to 12|. A management-led group prposed Sunday

   The NYSE index was off 0.54 at 147.00. At the American Stock
Exchange, the composite market index was off 0.69 at 294.34.

<HEAD>GTE Reports 50 Cases of Vandalism Since Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-distance telephone service was
restored early today to about 22,300 GTE North Inc. customers after
cables were cut deliberately in Three Rivers, company officials
said.
   It was the latest of about 50 acts of vandalism to GTE telephone
equipment since last week, when 2,200 union employees struck the
company's Michigan subsidiary, GTE spokesman Lowell Kinney said.
GTE provides telephone service to 500,000 Michigan customers in 58
of the state's 83 counties.
   The company usually has about 24 cases of vandalism in a year,
Kinney said.
   ``We have no idea who is doing it, and we won't speculate,''
Kinney said. ``But there's no question the damage is intentional.''
   Kinney said the cases were being reported to the appropriate law
enforcement officials. Most cases involve cut telephone cables or
damaged telephone equipment.
   Local 116 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
called the strike after contract negotiations collapsed last
Tuesday.
   Union spokesman Keith Flewelling said today the union takes no
responsibility for the reported damage.
   ``I'm certain that the company is blaming our striking workers
for it. But obviously, we don't condone vandalism,'' Flewelling
said. ``What we want to do is get back to the bargaining table.''
   No new talks have been scheduled.
   In the latest case of vandalism, about 26,000 customers in eight
southwest Michigan communities were left without long-distance
service from 1 a.m. to 7 a.m. today after someone cut four cables
at a long-distance switching center at Three Rivers, Kinney said.
He said some parts of those communities rely on long-distance
service to reach their sheriff's department or nearest hospital.
   Kinney said repair crews still were trying to restore service to
about 3,700 customers in the Constantine and White Pigeon areas
this morning.

   Batus Inc. has extended to Wednesday its
$72 per share cash offer for Farmers Group Inc., one of the
nation's largest insurers, the companies announced Monday.
   The deadline had been scheduled to expire last Friday.
   In a statement Monday, Batus also reported that negotiations
between it and the Los Angeles-based company were ``progressing
satisfactorily,'' but said there would be no comment from either
side about the talks.
   Farmers and Batus, based in Louisville, have been battling
before insurance regulators in nine states where the merger
proposal must be approved.
   Arizona regulators have approved the deal, and Illinois and Ohio
officials have given tentative approval, imposing conditions that
Batus has said it would meet.
   Idaho, Washington and Oregon have rejected a merger, and
decisions or hearings are pending in Texas and Kansas. California
regulators turned down the deal, but that decision was overturned
by a court.
   In the various insurance hearings, Farmers has argued that
Batus' tobacco interests would make the company reluctant to
continue the insurer's emphasis on non-smoker discounts.
   Batus has promised to continue the discounts if a merger is
approved. Batus is the U.S. management arm for London-based B.A.T.
Industries PLC.

   Soybean, corn and oat futures plunged their
permitted daily limits early in today's session on the Chicago
Board of Trade in reaction to heavy overnight rainfall overnight in
western and central Iowa.
   Wheat futures also were sharply lower.
   Rain was headed east into the central Corn Belt, where a
summer-long drought has wreaked severe damage on the corn and
soybean crops.
   But analysts said the rain was coming too late to greatly
benefit the crops; corn plants passed their most vulnerable period
in mid-July and most of the soybean crop is past the critical
pod-setting stage.
   ``This rain should not really do that much damage to prices; we
might see a rally,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Corn and oat futures are limited to daily moves of 10 cents a
bushel. The wheat limit is 15 cents and the soybeans are limited to
moves of 30 cents a bushel except for the August soybean contract,
which has no limit pending its expiration today.
   In early trading, wheat was 8 cents to 10\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.81{ a bushel; corn was 2}
cents to 9} cents lower with September at $2.77{ a bushel; oats
were 6 cents to 10 cents lower with September at $2.49 a bushel;
soybeans were 11 cents to 36{ cents lower with August at $8.33 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .08 cent to .85 cent lower with October at
71.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to 1.15 cents
lower with August at 81.65 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent to .83
cent lower with October at 40.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .47 cent to .77 cent lower with August at 36.50 cents a pound.

   Stock prices drifted lower this morning, as
traders showed little conviction about prospects for the economy,
inflation or interest rates.
   The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which fell 11.03 on
Friday and 21.52 for the week, was off 0.35 at 2,015.65 at noontime.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 2 to 1 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 396 up, 797 down
and 569 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 61.64 million shares as of noon on Wall
Street, up from 49.59 million shares traded at the same point in
the previous session.
   Trading volume has been sluggish in recent days as investors
have shunned the market while trying to figure out where the
economy is headed and what the prospects are for inflation and
interest rates.
   The economic indicators have been generally strong, a
development which might normally support stock prices.
   But the pace of economic growth has raised concerns about a
resurgence of inflation and speculation that the Federal Reserve
may take new steps to choke off a price rise by pushing interest
rates higher.
   Higher rates would make the yields available on bonds more
attractive.
   Later this week, the government plans to report on consumer
prices in July and second-quarter economic growth.
   Stock prices opened higher, but quickly changed direction as
bond prices slipped. Yields on the closely-watched 30-year Treasury
bond edged up past the 9.40 percent mark after finishing below that
level last week.
   Charles Jensen, a technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.,
said today's decline in stock prices was ``a continuation of a
pattern of weakness in the bond market.''
   ``We have a heavy calendar of new (Treasury) issues this week
and some serious economic figures that everyone is worried about.
You have a lot of people flocking to the sidelines pending some
improvement,'' Jensen said.

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although it has plenty of oil, natural
gas, coal and other sources of energy, Indonesia is considering a
nuclear power plant as a backstop against the day when the other
resources won't be enough.
   Supporters of the nuclear option say the country has little
choice since electricity demand on the main island of Java is
expected to increase more than sixfold by the year 2015. Java is
home for more than 60 percent of Indonesia's 170 million people and
uses 80 percent of its energy.
   Opponents insist that alternative energy sources should be
enough and cite safety and environmental objections to the nuclear
option. They contend that a country burdened with a $40 billion
foreign debt can't realistically spend an additional billion
dollars or so on nuclear power.
   Three experimental nuclear reactors used for research already
operate at Bandung in West Java, JogJakarta in central Java and at
Serpong, 19 miles southwest of Jakarta.
   Officials of the Batan, national atomic energy agency, say
Serpong is the third-largest neutron-producing reactor in the world
after Grenoble in France and Brookhaven on Long Island in New York.
   Subsidized by West Germany and opened last August by President
Suharto, the 30-megawatt Serpong reactor is for research on fuel
elements and processing of radioactive waste and produces
radioisotopes for food preservation.
   In opening the plant, Suharto said it was important for
Indonesian scientists to learn nuclear technology.
   ``When eventually our development effort requires the use of
nuclear energy to generate electricity, we will then have mastered
the technology.''
   Development of nuclear power now has the government's lowest
energy priority, behind hydroelectricity, geothermal resources,
coal, gas and oil. Gas and oil are regarded as mainly for export
and earn about 70 percent of the country's foreign exchange.
   Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of liquified natural
gas and East Asia's biggest oil exporter with a 1.2
million-barrel-a-day quota from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   Proponents of nuclear power are led by Bacharuddin Jusuf
Habibie, the Cabinet minister in charge of research and technology.
He is best known for establishing aircraft manufacturing in
Indonesia and is regarded as close to Suharto.
   The multipurpose reactor at Serpong is one of the facilities
prepared to support eventual development of a nuclear generating
station, Habibie told a seminar on atomic energy in June.
   He said Java will need an additional 27,000 megawatts of
electric power by the year 2015 and available sources of supply can
provide only 20,000. Habibie also said that since it will take
seven to 10 years to build a nuclear plant, a decision should be
made soon to head off a possible power shortage.
   A World Bank analysis said last year, however, that Indonesia
should delay until 1995 any decision on nuclear power.
   ``For the short to medium term, a nuclear power program can't be
justified on economic grounds,'' the analysis said. It estimated
that nuclear energy per kilowatt-hour costs at least five U.S.
cents compared to three cents for conventional energy.
   The World Bank report bolstered Indonesian Treasury officials
who contend that the project is too ambitious and costly.
   Habibie and his opponents agree that Indonesia can't afford to
finance nuclear power through the usual commercial methods.
   He proposes instead a ``build-operate-transfer'' (BOT)
arrangement. Under this system a foreign contractor builds the
plant, operates it for 15 years and transfers it to the government
after earning a reasonable return on selling electricity.
   Batan, the atomic energy agency, has selected a site for a
900-megawatt plant and is studying offers to build it from three
foreign consortia: Framatome of France, which is linked with
Kraftwerk Union of West Germany; Westinghouse, the U.S. company
which has joined forces with Mitsubishi of Japan on the project;
and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., which is cooperating with Japan's
Marubeni Corp. and Hitachi Co.
   The proposed site is in central Java 285 miles east of Jakarta,
not far from a dormant volcano. Java has 28 active volcanos and
environmentalists question the wisdom of building a nuclear plant
near even a dormant one.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Naoko Kamimura invested in the stock market
recently for the first time after a broker told her the stock of a
machinery company was almost guaranteed to rise.
   The 24-year-old airline stewardess took 680,000 yen, worth about
$5,200, from a low-interest savings account. She bought 1,000
shares, and in less than a month, the share price soared by nearly
40 percent.
   ``The salesman convinced me that the rise of the share price was
promised because he had reliable insider information about the
company which is not available to the public,'' she said.
   Ms. Kamimura's profit is an example of Japan's traditional
acceptance of insider trading, which in other financial centers is
considered an unfair strategy for profiting in stocks through the
use of confidential information.
   But Japan is under intensifying pressure to abandon some
traditional practices and adopt standards accepted in New York and
London as the Tokyo exchange has grown into the world's largest
stock market.
   Foreign and some domestic investors are urging the government to
take tougher measures against dubious practices, warning that the
Tokyo market will lose credibility with foreign investors, whose
presence in Tokyo is rapidly growing.
   As a result of these pressures and recent scandals, the
government is tightening a weak law on insider trading and
expanding restrictions on securities firms and banks.
   Among the scandals:
   _ Last September, Hyogo Sogo Bank of Osaka was suspected of
insider trading when it hastily sold large holdings of Tateho
Chemical shares prior to the announcement that Tateho had lost
several million dollars speculating on bond futures.
   Later, it was learned that Tateho had revealed the loss to Hyogo
Sogo Bank, its creditor, before the public announcement.
   _ In July, the political and business worlds were shocked when
aides to top leaders including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa were found to have earned up to
$800,000 by trading unlisted shares of a real estate company,
Recruit Cosmos Co.
   _ Also in July, massive insider trading was suspected when the
share price of Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co. jumped hours before
it was announced that Nippon Steel Co., the world's largest
steelmaker, had acquired a stake in Sankyo.
   Both the Finance Ministry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange are
investigating the case, and it has been revealed that a large
number of employees of both companies bought Sankyo shares before
the deal was made public.
   Shortly after the Tateho case broke, the Finance Ministry
decided to revise the Securities and Exchange Law and significantly
enlarge the ministry's investigatory and surveillance functions on
stock dealings.
   The Diet, the Japanese parliament, passed the revised law in May
and it will be implemented by October. For the first time, criminal
punishment was introduced for insider trading; that provision is to
take effect next April.
   David Ruder, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, said while visiting Tokyo in February that the bill
covered ``98 percent of what we cover in the United States of
illegal trading.''
   Keisuke Matsuura, a private investment consultant who has
followed the Japanese stock market for more than 30 years, said the
disclosure of the Recruit Cosmos case, with its links to top
political aides, was itself a sign of change.
   ``Five years ago, behind-the-door dealings like these were
routinely practiced but they were never revealed,'' Matsuura said.
   Meanwhile, the securities industry is taking steps against
insider trading.
   Nomura Securities Co., the largest securities house in Japan and
one of the largest in the world, recently announced that it is
separating corporate and investment sections and will block the
flow of information between the two _ a barrier known in the
investment trade as the ``Chinese Wall.'' It's intended to block a
major potential source of inside information.
   Earlier this month, the Tokyo Stock Exchange requested member
companies to streamline the disclosure process and asked for the
prompt release of corporate information which may affect share
prices.
   Despite such favorable signs, many market participants believe
the dominance of traditions and customs won't change easily by
simply establishing new rules and restrictive measures.
   ``The mentality of the investors and stockbrokers has to be
changed drastically if insider trading is to be stopped,'' said
Matsuura, who is also familiar with overseas stock markets.
   Keiichi Nishida at Kidder Peabody & Co.'s Tokyo office
commented: ``All those changes we hear lately seem to be just
bluffs.''
   Nishida, who worked for Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. until
recently, believes it will require what he called a near miracle to
change the fundamental nature of the Japanese stock market.
   Interviews with brokers and officials at securities firms, who
spoke only on condition of anonymity, showed how hard it will be to
change the tradition of insider trading.
   ``I can't recommend my clients what to buy if I have no insider
information at all, and my clients won't buy shares if I can't give
them useful information,'' said a broker at one of the top four
securities firms in Japan.

<HEAD>It's RIP for IBM's RIP, A Dealer Incentive Plan That Misfired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. is
preparing to drop a dealer incentive plan that misfired by driving
down the street price of the Personal System-2.
   The program began Jan. 1 and was supposed to last for a year,
but will be dropped after Sept. 30 because of complaints by some
dealers, said Roger Savitt, an IBM spokesman.
   Some dealers took the credits and bonuses that they received for
achieving sales targets and applied the money to lowering their
prices. That disturbed other dealers, who said the plan was eroding
their profit margins.
   In order to mollify dealers who like the plan, incentives will
be made richer until the program ends. Savitt said IBM has not
decided what to replace the program with.
   On another matter, IBM spokesman James Monahan said last week
the company has no intention of reintroducing the PC AT, which it
phased out after introducing the Personal System-2 line in April
1987.
   Confusion may have arisen because IBM is planning to introduce a
computer that uses the same microprocessor as the AT, Intel Corp.'s
80286, and does not run the new Operating System-2. Currently the
only members of the Personal System-2 family that don't use the new
operating system have less powerful microprocessors.
   IBM has not specified when such a computer might be released,
but has said since February that introducing one was part of its
strategy.

   Stock prices closed lower in the slowest trading
day of the year, with investors concerned that British interest
rates may be raised again.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 12
points, or 0.7 percent, lower at 1,832.3.
   Volume was a scant 231.5 million shares, the lowest recorded in
1988, and well down from 342.4 million shares on Friday.
   The market remained depressed throughout the trading session by
fears of another increase in the British commercial banks' base
lending rate, which was raised to 11 percent from 10.5 percent two
weeks ago.
   The government has raised interest rates several times this year
to choke off potentially inflationary growth in the British economy.
   ``We certainly wouldn't rule out another rise in the short
term,'' said Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Warburg Securities.
   But the government might wait for more economic data to be
released, and assessed, before acting, he added.
   Investors are awaiting Thursday's release of British trade
figures for July, dealers said.
   Market sentiment also was undermined by the low level of trading
activity during the summer vacation season, dealers said.

   Stock prices slumped broadly this afternoon,
extending last week's losses in moderate activity.
   The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which fell 11.03 on
Friday and 21.52 for the week, was off 18.49 at 1,997.51 with two
hours left in the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 5 to 2 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 368 up, 1,016
down and 491 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 92.34 million shares as of 2 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Trading volume was running ahead of Friday's sluggish pace, but
analysts said many investors continued to shy away from the market
in advance of a flurry of economic reports due to be released later
this week.
   The government plans to report this week on consumer prices for
July and its latest estimate of second-quarter economic growth,
among other things.
   The economy has been growing at such a strong pace in recent
months that the Federal Reserve boosted its discount rate by a half
percentage point to 6.5 percent earlier this month in a bid to head
off inflation.
   Some stock market analysts feel further rate increases may be
forthcoming, a development that would make Treasury issues look
even more attractive to big institutional investors while reducing
the appeal of stocks.
   Today, yields on the closely-watched 30-year Treasury bond edged
past the 9.40 percent mark after finishing below that level last
week.
   Among the actively traded blue-chip issues today, American
Telephone & Telegraph was off ] at 24], Ford was down 1{ at 47[ and

<HEAD>Australia Unveils Koala Platinum Coin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australia on Monday took the wraps off its Koala
platinum coin, becoming the first major nation to unveil coins made
from platinum bullion.
   The coins are 99.95 percent pure platinum and are struck with a
koala bear on one side and Queen Elizabeth II on the other. They
come in denominations of one ounce, one-half ounce, one-quarter
ounce and one-tenth ounce.
   The only platinum coins currently available are from the Isle of
Man, a tiny country in the Irish Sea. But Canada is close on the
heels of Australia and expects to have a platinum Maple Leaf coin
available by Christmas.
   Australia's Koala will be on sale by mid-September.
   The Koala is aimed at investors rather than coin collectors and
is being priced about 5 percent to 7 percent above the market price
of platinum, a relatively small markup in the coin business.
   The coins can be used as legal tender in Australia, but it
wouldn't be a good idea. The face value of the one-ounce coin is
100 Australian dollars (about $81.40), while the market price of
platinum bullion is more than $500 an ounce.
   Koala coins will be available from coin dealers as well as some
brokerage houses and banks. The North American distributors are
A-Mark Precious Metals Inc., Mocatta Corp. and Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith.

<HEAD>Newspaper Begins Bank Name Contest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank trivia buffs have a chance to cash
in on their knowledge in a record year for mergers, closings and
consolidations.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram began a contest Monday challenging
readers to match Texas institutions' old and new names.
   The newspaper, which advertised the contest in its business
section, said the grand prize is not a blank check, but it is
``reported to be more valuable than a certificate of stock from
River Plaza National Bank (or just about any other bank, for that
matter). We'll provide details later.''
   The contest was dubbed the First American Texas National Bank
contest and survey.
   Many bank names are combinations of First, National, American,
Texas, and of course, Bank. The contest is a challenge because many
Texas institutions use arrangements of those and other words.
   Also, contestants must pick a new name for the latest impending
north Texas bank merger, involving the company that owns Texas
American Bank-Fort Worth and National Bancshares Corp. of Texas in
San Antonio.
   The union will create another bank identity, but it is uncertain
whether the new institution will be renamed, said Anne Quinn, Texas
American marketing vice president.

   CBS Records will move its data-processing
operation from New Jersey to lower Manhattan, a company executive
announced Monday.
   The record company has leased more than 40,000 square feet of

people will move from Secaucus, N.J., into the newly leased space
beginning Jan. 1, said CBS Records Executive Vice President Seymour
Gartenberg.
   CBS Inc., the former parenle-family dwellings would bankrupt a
Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance fund.
   The fund has helped millions of first-time, low- and
moderate-income homebuyers since its creation in the 1930s, HUD
said Monday.
   HUD called off a sales campaign for foreclosed properties
because of the threat of a lawsuit by the National Housing Law
Project. The group claims HUD is violating a homeless-assistance
law passed last year that requires government agencies to consider
the needs of the homeless before selling foreclosed properties.

   The stock market was broadly lower this
afternoon, as worries that interest rates may continue rising
helped extend last week's losses.
   The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which fell 11.03 on
Friday and 21.52 for the week, was off 19.91 at 1,996.09 with one
hour left in the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of more than 5 to
2 among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 354 up,
1,098 down and 466 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 104.34 million shares as of 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Analysts said many investors continued to shy away from the
market in advance of a flurry of economic reports due to be
released later this week.
   The government plans to report this week on consumer prices for
July and second-quarter economic growth, among other things.
   The economy has been growing at such a strong pace in recent
months that the Federal Reserve boosted its discount rate by a half
percentage point to 6.5 percent earlier this month in a bid to head
off inflation.
   Some stock market analysts feel further rate increases may be
forthcoming, a development that would make Treasury issues more
attractive to big institutional investors at the expense of the
uncertain returns on stocks.
   Today, yields on the closely-watched 30-year Treasury bond edged
past the 9.40 percent mark after finishing below that level last
week.
   Wickes was among the most actively-traded issues on the NYSE,

   Futures prices of soybeans, corn and oats
plummeted their permitted daily limits Monday on the Chicago Board
of Trade in reaction to heavy showers in Iowa and slack foreign
demand for U.S. grain and soybean products.
   Wheat futures also closed sharply lower.
   Rain was moving east into the central Corn Belt, where a
summer-long drought has inflicted severe damage on the corn and
soybean crops. But analysts said the rain was coming too late to
greatly benefit the crops; corn plants passed their most vulnerable
period in mid-July and most of the soybean crop is past the
critical pod-setting stage.
   ``The rain was the catalyst'' for the sell-off, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``But the thing behind it all is that demand is still not very
good,'' he said. ``We need an increase in demand to get this market
moving and we're just not getting it.''
   Mickey Luth, a soybean analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in Chicago, agreed. ``The market's waiting for the demand to
develop, and with no players, it moves lower,'' he said.
   Corn and oat futures were limited to daily moves of 10 cents a
bushel. The wheat limit was 15 cents and soybeans were limited to
moves of 30 cents a bushel except for the expiring August soybean
contract, which had no limit.
   Wheat settled 7} cents to 11{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.81 a bushel; corn was 3} cents to 10
cents lower with September at $2.77\ a bushel; oats were 9{ cents

<HEAD>FDIC Putting Continental Loans on Public Auction Block</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will try a new
approach _ a public auction _ to sell more than $75 million in
shaky loans it acquired in its 1984 bailout of the Continental
Illinois National Bank & Trust Co., officials said Monday.
   Parties ranging from other financial institutions to collection
agencies and ``vulture funds'' are likely to join in the bidding on
Oct. 20, according Joel D. Zegart, president of JBS & Associates
Inc., which will conduct the open-outcry auction in a ballroom at a
downtown hotel.
   The loans, which include commercial, real estate, energy and
personal loans, are among $5.2 billion in Continental Bank loans
the FDIC purchased for $3.5 billion as part of its $4.5 billion
plan to save the bank from failure.
   Continental, acting as the FDIC's administrator, has collected
on or disposed of problem loans with a face value of more than $3.7
billion since the federal rescue, said Jerry Lemmons, a member of
the bank team in charge of the effort.
   The FDIC will assume sole responsiblity for disposing of any
loans that are not sold or collected on by Nov. 1, Lemmons said.
   Chicago-based JBS pioneered the auction approach to loan sales,
holding the first such event last October when it generated about
$2.7 million from the sale of $8 million worth of loans made by two
failed central Illinois banks, Zegart said.
   The FDIC and Continental opted for the public-auction route
after a failed offering of $1.2 billion worth of the problem loans.
None of the sealed bids received for that package met the minimum
price set by the agency.
   ``The biggest advantage is that (the public auction) provides a
sense of confirmation for buyers,'' Zegart said. ``It provides an
opportunity for them to be in an open forum and see how their peer
group values certain assets.''
   Prices paid at similar, though smaller, JBS loan auctions ranged
from a penny per dollar of face value for the most hopelessly
uncollectable loans to 95 cents on the dollar, he said.
   The worst-case loans, called ``charge-off'' loans because they
are regarded by the seller as not worth the cost of collecting,
typically are purchased for pennies on the dollar by collection
agencies and investment pools called ``vulture funds,'' the
officials said.
   Loans with a better chance of being repaid may be bought by
thrifts, savings and loans or sophisticated investment groups that
are prepared to work out payment schedules or take the debtor to
court, Zegart said.
   Lemmons said the package of Continental Bank loans being readied
for auction would be ``heavily skewed'' toward charge-off loans.

<HEAD>Banca Commerciale Still Wants To Buy Irving Bank Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA said Monday it
still wants to acquire control of Irving Bank Corp. despite a
regulatory hurdle erected by the Federal Reserve.
   The Fed said the Italian government agency that owns about 60
percent of Banca Commerciale will have to supply financial
information in connection with the bid, and some banking industry
observers have questioned whether the agency would be willing to do
so.
   Banca Commerciale said it was surprised by the Fed's decision,
which it said was contrary to its decision in 1982 when Banca
Commerciale acquired Litco Bancorporation of New York Inc.
   ``We are exploring various options for proceeding ahead,'' said
Enrico Braggiotti, chairman of the Italian bank, which is offering
$84 a share for 51 percent of New York-based Irving. In a rival
bid, Bank of New York has offered $15 in cash and 1.575 of its own
shares for each Irving share.
   The Fed's ruling was announced after the close of trading
Friday. Irving's stock fell 25 cents a share to $66.37{ on Monday
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The government agency that controls the bank is Istituto per la
Ricostruzione Industriale.

   A management group's offer to take
Wickes Cos. Inc. private in a $598 million leveraged buyout has
brought numerous inquiries from other potential buyers, the
company's investment banker said Monday.
   The $12-a-share tender offer, made late Sunday by a management
group led by Wickes Chairman Sanford Sigoloff, included a 60-day
wait before the group would begin buying Wickes stock to give other
bidders a chance to emerge.
   Numerous potential buyers called Monday, said Michael
Tennenbaum, senior managing director at Bear Stearns & Co. Inc.,
which was retained to advise Wickes management on the offer.
Tennenbaum wouldn't reveal names, but said some callers were
interested in buying the company intact and others sought
information on some of its parts.
   ``Our phones have been ringing off the hook,'' Tennenbaum said.
``People who have a prima facie financial capacity to do this
transaction are calling in impressive numbers.''
   Wickes' stock closed at $13.25 a share Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange, up $3.87 a share from Friday's close.
   A buyer of Wickes would have to assume $2.1 billion in debt. The
company's main lines of business are industrial products, including
auto fabrics and aircraft and missile parts; home improvement and
furnishings, including Wickes Furniture and Builders Emporium
do-it-yourself stores in Southern California; and a group that
makes wallpaper and carpet.
   Sigoloff, who led Wickes out of bankruptcy proceedings 3{ years
ago, said the management group financed by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. wouldn't begin buying shares until Oct. 20, and didn't make it
a condition of the deal that the company refuse other bids.
   ``While we believe that our offer is fair, both management and
the board want to ensure that the company's shareholders obtain the
best price for their shares,'' Sigoloff said in a news release
announcing the leveraged buyout offer.
   The 60-day delay in purchasing shares was intended ``to ensure
that ample opportunity is afforded to determine whether it is
possible to achieve a higher price for our stockholders,'' he said.
   Sigoloff refused an interview request Monday, and a company
spokesman declined to expand on Sunday's statement.
   The group is offering $12 a share for up to 83 percent of
Wickes' 49.8 million outstanding shares. If the buyout is
consummated, each share that isn't purchased would be exchanged for
a share of a new class of preferred stock valued at $12 a share.
   The offer is contingent on 50 percent of outstanding shares
being offered for sale, and on obtaining financing, the company
said.
   In announcing the buyout offer, Wickes said it lost $12.4
million in the second quarter, in contrast to its profit of $18.9
million in the second quarter of 1987. Second-quarter sales were
$937.9 million, up from $865 million a year earlier.
   Sigoloff and others in management run little risk in making the
offer, said Leslie W. Childress, an analyst who follows the company
for Harper, McLean & Co. in Seattle.
   ``They win either way,'' Childress said. ``They either are
successful and get it at $12 a share ... or somebody comes in and
offers a bit more and they win anyway.''
   Some analysts suggested the heavy debt burden made it unlikely
the price would rise much beyond the $12 offer. Others suggested
potential buyers might be interested in various of Wickes' diverse
businesses rather than in running the company as presently
organized.
   ``What you have in Wickes are leadership niches in three major
markets,'' said Gerald S. May of PaineWebber in New York. He valued
the company at $12 to $15 a share.
   Sigoloff brought the company out of bankruptcy in January 1985
to embark on a buying spree that included the acquisition of
consumer and industrial products lines from Gulf and Western Corp.,
home improvement businesses from W.R. Grace & Co. and Collins &
Aikman Corp., a New York manufacturer of auto interiors, fabrics
and wallpaper.
   Wickes made unsuccessful bids for National Gypsum of Dallas,
Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp. of Toledo, Ohio, and Lear Siegler
Inc., a Southern California aerospace and auto equipment
manufacturer.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mostly higher Monday in
skittish domestic trading after rising sharply overseas in the face
of concerted central-bank intervention.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid price for gold of $433.20 a troy ounce, up from
$431.25 late Friday.
   The dollar gained over the weekend in the Far East and continued
to move higher when trading shifted to Europe. Dealers said there
was no fundamental reason for the dollar's strength except that the
market simply is bullish toward the currency.
   ``The dollar is the flavor of the month, and people are going
for it,'' said Keith Dipple, chief dealer at Banque Francaise de
Commerce Exterieure.
   A host of European central banks joined the Federal Reserve in
selling dollars when the currency was trading at about 1.9150 West
German marks, but dealers said the dollar slipped only temporarily
and then resumed its rise.
   The dollar closed higher in Europe and managed to finish mostly
higher in domestic dealings despite a heavy bout of profit-taking
and late central-bank intervention.
   ``It was really wild on the downside,'' said Frank Watson, vice
president at Swiss Bank Corp., commenting on the tumble the dollar
took when the Fed intervened.
   Despite the intervention, the dollar ``is still well in
demand,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust and
Savings Bank in Chicago.
   He noted that investors ``are getting more and more complacent
about intervention _ they are more willing to hold onto dollars''
when the central banks sell the currency.
   Traders noted that the market was very thin. ``There's a lack of
liquidity,'' Watson said. ``That accentuates the dollar's moves.''
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.48 yen to a closing 133.88 yen. Later in London,
it was quoted higher at 134.05 yen. In New York the dollar closed
at 133.63 yen, down from 133.69 yen on Friday.
   The pound fell sharply against the dollar. One dealer cited
disappointment that an expected increase in British interest rates
didn't materialize.
   In London it cost $1.6767 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7025
late Friday. In New York it cost $1.6860 to buy one pound, less
expensive than late Friday's $1.6987.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.9086 West German marks, up from 1.8965; 1.6075 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5954; 6.4680 French francs, up from 6.4193;
1,412.00 Italian lire, up from 1,405.00, and 1.2285 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2301.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday: 1.9190
West German marks, up from 1.8925; 1.6105 Swiss francs, up from
1.5915; 6.5050 French francs, up from 6.4125; 2.1605 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1390; 1,417.00 Italian lire, up from 1,405.50,
and 1.2291 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2271.
   Gold for current delivery on the New York Commodity Exchange
rose to $433.60 a troy ounce from $431.70 late Friday.
   Gold held steady in London, finishing at a late bid price of
$432 a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday's late bid. In Zurich,
gold fell to a closing bid of $431 an ounce, compared with $432.50
late Friday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.61 to close at a
bid $432.01 an ounce, compared with Saturday's $433.62.
   Silver prices also were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver for
current delivery rose to $6.730 a troy ounce, from $6.657 late
Friday. Silver bullion prices fell in London, where the metal was
trading at a late bid price of $6.64 an ounce, compared with
Friday's $6.68.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Collapse On Wet Weather, Slack Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean, corn and oat futures prices plummeted their permitted
daily limits Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to
heavy showers in Iowa and slack foreign demand for U.S. grain and
soybean products.
   Wheat futures also closed sharply lower.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures fell; platinum
posted sharp gains to lead precious metals futures higher; energy
futures were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Rain was moving east Monday into the central Corn Belt, where a
summer-long drought has wreaked severe damage on the corn and
soybean crops. But analysts said the rain and cooler temperatures
were coming too late to greatly benefit the crops; corn plants
passed their most vulnerable period in mid-July and most of the
soybean crop is past the critical pod-setting stage.
   ``The rain was the catalyst'' for the selloff in the grain
futures market, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean, Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Corn and oat futures were limited to daily moves of 10 cents a
bushel. The wheat limit was 15 cents and the soybeans were limited
to moves of 30 cents a bushel except for the expiring August
soybean contract, which had no limit.
   Monday marked the 10th consecutive week in which soybean futures
have advanced or declined the limit on the first trading day of the
week.
   Wheat settled 7} cents to 11 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.81 a bushel; corn was 3} cents to 10
cents lower with September at $2.77\ a bushel; oats were 10 cents
lower across the board with September at $2.49 a bushel; soybeans
were 23{ cents to 32{ cents lower with August at $8.37 a bushel.
   Cattle futures posted steep losses on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on expectations that cash prices would fall later this
week as demand declines, analysts said.
   ``We're coming into Labor Day and most of the buying for the
Labor Day holiday has been completed, so there is expected to be
some slackening of demand as result,'' said Thomas Morgan,
president of Sterling Research Corp., of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Pork futures prices declined on ideas the cooler weather in the
Midwest would result in farmers bringing more hogs to market,
Morgan said.
   The frozen pork belly market received some potentially bullish
news after the close. The Agriculture Department's monthly
cold-storage report showed 73.7 million pounds of pork bellies in
cold storage on Aug. 1. The number, while much higher than last
year's 28.6 million pounds on the same date, was below market
estimates, Morgan said.
   Live cattle settled .65 cent to 1.38 cents lower with October at
70.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent to 1.32 cents
lower with August at 81.55 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent to
1.20 cents lower with October at 40.37 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent to 1.93 cents lower with August at 36.25
cents a pound.
   Platinum futures leaped more than $11 a troy ounce in fairly
active trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange on strong
technical signals, analysts said.
   Gold and silver futures followed on New York's Commodity
Exchange, ignoring the normally bearish input of weaker grain
futures and foreign currency markets, said Craig Sloane, precious
metals analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Platinum settled $11 to $11.50 higher with October at $546.20 a
troy ounce; gold was $1.80 to $1.90 higher with October at $437.40
a troy ounce; silver was 7 cents to 8 cents higher with September
at $6.74 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices closed mostly higher Monday in quiet
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Analysts said the
market was driven by mainly technical factors.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 6
cents higher with September at $15.76 a barrel; heating oil was .16
cent to .26 cent higher with September at 44.73 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .07 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
September at 47.52 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
on fears of higher interest rates. The contract for September
delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 index finished 5.35 points
lower at 256.60.

<TEXT>
   The new chief of Chevron Corp. said Monday
he is basing his plans for the nation's fourth-largest energy
company on oil prices below $20 a barrel.
   Kenneth T. Derr, 52, elected chief executive officer last Friday
by the company's board of directors, also told a news conference he
expects oil prices to continue to move in a volatile pattern.
   ``Ultimately oil prices are going to increase significantly,''
said Derr, who takes over from George M. Keller on Jan. 1. Chevron
will ``continue with an (oil) exploration program and projects that
will be important to us,'' he added.
   The selection of Derr, who has been one of Chevron's two vice
chairmen for nearly three years, was widely expected. It follows
the company's report that it earned $520 million in the second
quarter, up 45 percent from its profits in the year-earlier quarter.
   Derr's most challenging assignment at the company was his
supervision of the merger with Gulf Corp. following Chevron's $13.3
billion acquisition of Gulf in 1984.
   Keller, 64, will take mandatory retirement at 65 after more than
seven years at the helm of Chevron.
   Derr's appointment isn't expected to bring major changes at the
international oil giant, obsevers said.
   In response to a question, Derr noted the fierce opposition by
environmentalists to oil drilling offshore Northern California. He
gave a strong hint, however, of what Chevron's attitude on the
question will be.
   ``I think the country is facing serious problems in the future
in terms of its energy supplies, '' he said. ``(Oil) imports are up
to 40 percent (of total U.S. consumption) today; they'll be over 50
percent in the next couple of years, and who knows from there?
   ``I think it's important that the country adopts policies that
allow for maximum development of U.S. energy reserves,'' he added.

   Interest-rate worries drove the stock market
broadly lower on Monday, pushing the closing Dow Jones Industrial
Average below 2,000 for the first time in nearly three months.
   ``This is very nervous trading,'' said Jack Baker, head of block
trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``This isn't the kind of
market that's going to bring people off the sidelines.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost 21.52 points
last week, gave up another 25.78 to close at 1,990.22.
   That was the lowest closing level for the market's best-known
indicator since it finished at 1,956.44 on May 27, the day before
the three-day Memorial Day holiday. When traders returned May 31,
the Dow climbed 74.68 points and the industrial average finished
above 2,000 every day since then.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 3 to 1
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 385 up,
1,107 down and 466 unchanged. The NYSE index fell 1.60 to 145.94.
   The pace of trading was sluggish, however. Volume on the floor
of the NYSE amounted to 122.25 million shares, down from 122.37
million shares on Friday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in
NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on
the over-the-counter market, totaled 144.90 million shares.
   As the market opened, stock prices pushed marginally higher, but
quickly reversed course when a decline in bond prices drove
fixed-income yields higher.
   Analysts said the yields available in the bond and money markets
are keeping many investors out of the stock market. That
inclination was even more pronounced on the eve of the first of a
flurry of economic reports due to be released this week, analysts
said.
   The government plans to report Tuesday on consumer prices for
July. Later in the week, it planned to revise its estimate of
second-quarter economic growth, among other things.
   The economy has been growing at such a strong pace that the
Federal Reserve boosted its rate on loans to member banks by a half
percentage point to 6.5 percent earlier this month in a bid to head
off inflation.
   Shearson's Baker said traders were worried that Tuesday's
consumer price report would show a big jump that would encourage
the central bank to push rates even higher. That would make
Treasury issues even more attractive to big institutional investors
compared with the uncertain returns on stocks.
   On Monday, prices of the widely-followed 30-year Treasury bond
fell $5 for every $1,000 in face value, pushing its yield to 9.45
percent from 9.39 percent on Friday.
   Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical market analysis for the
brokerage A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said yields on
shorter term issues are also attractive. He noted that 5-year
Treasury issues are yielding about 9 percent, for instance, while
the Dow Jones industrials have lost more than 160 points since
early July.
   ``As long as stocks are going down, these will provide some very
stiff competition for the investors dollar ... The institutional
investor who has substantial cash reserves is saying, `Why bother?
I'll take a safe haven until the economic uncertainties clarify
themselves','' Goldman said.
   Wickes was among the most actively-traded issues on the NYSE,
jumping 3~ to 13\. A management-led group proposed Sunday to take
the company private in a leveraged buyout at $12 a share in cash
and stock.
   There was also some interest in utility stocks that have either
recently passed or are approaching deadlines for investors to
qualify for dividends. Philadelphia Electric was the most active
issue, down [ at 17}, while Kansas City Power & Light rose \ to 29~.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone & Telegraph
fell { to 24\, Ford tumbled 1} to 46~ and International Business
Machines fell 2 to 110}.
   Several airline stocks fell. AMR, the parent of American
Airlines, was off 1 at 42\, and UAL, parent of United Airlines,
fell 2| to 88|.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, fell $26.896 billion, or 1.03 percent, to
$2.576 trillion.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 3.95 to 294.49, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was off 3.26 to 256.98.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 2.02
to 293.01. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 373.73, down 3.69.

<HEAD>HUD Faults Foreclosure Complaint of Homeless Advocates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development said Monday the demands of a homeless assistance group
to stop the sales of foreclosed single-family dwellings would
bankrupt a Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance fund.
   The fund, sustained by the collection of mortgage insurance
premiums from homebuyers who use FHA mortgage insurance, has helped
millions of first-time, low- and moderate-income homebuyers since
its creation in the 1930s, HUD said.
   ``If we suspended sales, the FHA fund would be out of operation
by the end of 1990,'' said J. Michael Dorsey, HUD general counsel.
   Earlier this month, HUD called off a national sales campaign,
which the department hoped would unload 15,000 foreclosed
single-family properties, and it canceled an auction of 158
foreclosed Washington, D.C.-area homes last weekend.
   The action was taken because of the threat of a lawsuit by the
National Housing Law Project, which claims HUD is violating a
homeless-assistance law passed last year that requires government
agencies to consider the needs of the homeless before selling
foreclosed properties.
   Dorsey said HUD does not consider the foreclosed, single-family
dwellings it is selling to be surplus property. The department
considers the homes to be inventory, he said.
   Additionally, he said HUD makes available all of its foreclosed
single-family homes to homeless providers at a discount of 10
percent below fair market value before the homes are listed for
sale to the public.
   The agency also offers homeless providers lease-purchase
agreements for the HUD-owned homes at a cost as low as $1 per year,
he said. The provider is responsible for maintaining the property
and paying the property taxes during the lease period.
   Since 1985, the agency has transferred about 200 single-family
homes to homeless providers, about half by sale and half by lease,
he said.
   Dorsey said the department is reviewing its process of making
single-family homes available to homeless providers and HUD
officials plan to meet with representatives of the Berkley,
Calif.-based National Housing Law Project soon to discuss possible
changes.
   The National Housing Law Project, however, is not satisfied. The
group, which assists lawyers helping indigent clients with housing
cases, is threatening again to challenge the housing sale in court.
   Florence Roisman, a staff attorney for the project, said the
group planned to file suit in Michigan on Tuesday to challenge a
scheduled sale there.

<TEXT>
   The management of Lear Siegler Seating Corp.
announced Monday that it agreed to purchase the company from
Forstmann Little & Co. in a buyout valued at $500 million.
   Management is being financed in part by the investment firm
Kidder, Peabody Group Inc., which will take an undisclosed equity
stake in the company.
   Forstmann, a private New York leveraged buyout firm with
diversified corporate holdings, acquired Lear Siegler in 1986 for
$2.1 billion. Forstmann proceeded to sell off the bulk of the
company's aerospace group and much of its commercial and industrial
operations.
   Senior managers of Lear Siegler Seating will run the new
company, and its headquarters will remain in Southfield, Mich.
   According to Kenneth L. Way, vice president of Lear Siegler's
automotive group who will serve as the new company's chairman and
chief executive, no changes in the company's operations are planned.
   ``This move, initiated by our management group, will provide the
necessary capital to invest in new plants and to develop innovative
interior automotive products,'' he said.
   Way also noted that acquisitions ``that complement the company's
existing interior systems sypply business will also be part of our
long-term strategic plan.'' Way said in a telephone interview that
there are several companies management might be interested in.
   Lear Siegler Seating designs and manufactures seat systems and
interior components for automakers including General Motors, Ford,
Chrysler, Mazda, BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot and
Renault.
   The company has more than 20 manufacturing facilities worldwide
as well as a joint venture with the Japanese conglomerate NHK
Industries, an automotive supplier. Annual revenues are in the $1
billion range, and Way said the company has seen its business grow
at an annual rate of more than 30 percent over the past several
years.
   To date Forstmann has sold off some $1.5 billion in Lear Siegler
operations. The last major asset sales occurred last year, when
Smiths Industries PLC acquired most of Lear Siegler's aerospace
unit for $350 million. General Electric Co. PLC, the British
electronics company, agreed to buy the remaining parts of the
operation for $205 million.
   Besides the aerospace group, Forstmann has sold Lear Siegler's
Piper Aircraft unit for an undisclosed price and its Smith & Wesson
handgun division for $112.5 million.
   Bill Reddig, a spokesman for Forstmann, said the investor group
``wants to put its main emphasis on the businesses they are
retaining,'' including Lear Siegler's auto glass operation.
   Two months ago Lear Siegler Holding Corp., the company Forstmann
formed to mount its acquisition, announced it was acquiring AFG
Industries Inc.'s auto glass unit for an undisclosed sum. The
operation complements Lear Siegler's Safelight Glass Corp., a major
autoglass concern, Reddig said.
   In addition to Santa Monica, Calif.-based Lear Siegler,
Forstmann also agreed to acquire Stanadyne Corp., a major
manufacturer of plumbing fixtures and diesel fuel injection systems
in an $820 million leveraged buyout.
   In recent years Forstmann also has acquired Dr. Pepper Co.,
Cybron Corp., Midland-Ross Corp. and The Topps Co. Inc.

<HEAD>Dissident Miners Sue Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of miners Monday filed a $1
billion federal lawsuit against the United Mine Workers of America
and its leadership, claiming the union prevented it from recovering
wages lost during a 3{-year strike.
   The lawsuit contended the union did not represent the miners
properly and discriminated against them because they did not take
part in selective picketing.
   Named in the suit filed in U.S. District Court included Rich
Trumka, UMW president; Cecil Roberts, vice president; and John
Banovick, secretary-treasurer. Each was accused of conspiring to
keep the 406 plaintiffs from collecting benefits to which they
should have been entitled.
   Jerry Hammond, a spokesman for the so-called ``Forgotten 400,''
said the lawsuit stemmed from an agreement reached in May between
the UMW and the A.T. Massey Coal Co. and its subsidiaries to end
selective strikes launched against two eastern Kentucky mines in
1984.
   The agreement, requiring payment of $4.47 million to the union,
also settled a lawsuit challenging Massey's decision to turn the
mines into non-union operations.
   About 700 miners, including Hammond, worked at the two mines
until February 1983 when all but a maintenance crew were laid off.
   The remaining miners workers lost their jobs Sept. 30, 1984, the
day before the two mines were sold to Sidney Coal Co., a subsidiary
of Ora Mae Coal Co., an operation owned by Massey.
   After the agreement was announced, Roberts said the $4.47
million for lost wages and benefits would be divided among about
250 miners, who had been on selective strikes, with each receiving
about $18,000.
   Hammond, of Red Jacket, W.Va., said the lawsuit contends that
the UMW breached its duty of fair representation by limiting the
number of members who would receive payments.
   Hammond and other plaintiffs also contend they have been
excluded from union meetings, thus violating the organization's
constitution.
   The lawsuit asks for a jury trial, plus $500 million in
compensatory and $500 million in punitive damages.
   In Washington, union spokesman Joseph Corcoran said late Monday
that the union's legal department had not yet seen the lawsuit. But
Corcoran said, ``The union is very confident that that settlement
will be upheld in any court.''
   Trumka pushed for the union's use of selective strikes, and on
Oct. 1, 1984 Massey became the first target after the company
refused to sign the union's national coal wage contract. Signing
would have given Massey's laid-off employees companywide
re-employment rights.
   The union finally called off the sometimes violent strike in
December 1985 when Massey agreed to settlement of an unfair labor
practice charge, but selective strikes against the two subsidiaries
continued until May.

   Rockwood Insurance Co. has agreed to pay
more than $1 million to settle lawsuits involving E.F. Hutton Group
in a complex mortgage insurance case, Rockwood officials announced
Monday.
   Robert E. Lauterbach, a member of Rockwood's board and chairman
of its executive committee, said the settlement included a payment
of $550,000 on Monday plus $200,000 annually for three years
beginning in 1989. The agreement also provided for both parties to
mutually release all outstanding liabilities.
   ``The payments are a modest settlement to get rid of all the
litigation,'' Lauterbach said. ``We felt it was worthwhile to
settle it and get it behind us. We consider this an extremely
satisfactory settlement.''
   In 1985, Hutton _ which was acquired earlier this year by
Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. _ announced plans to sue
First American Mortgage Co. of Maryland in connection with Hutton's
purchase of about $64 million in mortgage loans from First
American. A major portion of the loans was delinquent, and Hutton
claimed the loans were insured fully by Rockwood.
   Subsidiary E.F. Hutton Mortgage Corp. sued Rockwood Insurance
Co. in 1986, seeking recovery under the surety bond issued by the
company.
   The suit demanded Rockwood pay Hutton the amount of the
outstanding balances of all delinquent loans, which then totaled
more than $32 million and with more delinquencies could have
increased to the full amount of the loans.
   Rockwood sued E.F. Hutton Mortgage Corp., alleging
non-compliance and violations of the surety bond and asking the
court to declare the bond void and unenforceable.
   Rockwood Insurance and Rockwood Holding Co. also filed a
separate complaint seeking damages from E.F. Hutton & Co. and its
parent, E.F. Hutton Group, in connection with the transactions
between Hutton Mortgage, First American Mortgage and Rockwood
Insurance.
   In May, a federal judge dismissed Hutton's motions to have
Rockwood's complaints dismissed and Rockwood's motion to dismiss
the Hutton complaint.
   Lauterbach said that since the litigation the company has
stopped writing financial insurance, such as the mortgage insurance
that was at issue in the Hutton litigation.

<HEAD>Venezuela President Blasts Foreign Creditor Banks at International
Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuelan President Jaime Lusinchi
leveled harsh criticism at foreign commercial banks Monday,
blasting them for what he called their ``speculative'' treatment of
Latin American debtors.
   ``Either we are loyal to our peoples and we look after their
well-being, or we yield with those who impose conditions on us and
violate our rights, and who only feel egoism, opulence and
insatiable avarice,'' Lusinchi told conference delegates from 23
Spanish and Portuguese-speaking nations of America and Europe.
   ``The speculative criteria that predominates in big financial
centers is incompatible with the interest of all people on earth,''
Lusinchi said.
   The president spoke during the opening ceremony of the Sixth
IberoAmerican Conference held to organize the planned 1992
celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America.
   Lusinchi's remarks come as Venezuela is seeking about $2.5
billion in new loans from foreign financial institutions to help
cover a balance of payments deficit.
   Commercial banks widely are expected to seek economic austerity
measures as a condition for new lending to Venezuela.
   Lusinchi labeled as ``absurd'' Latin America's current economic
situation, in which countries from Mexico to Argentina are
struggling to pay foreign debts of over $400 billion. Venezuela,
which has a $34 billion foreign debt, is the region's
fourth-largest debtor.
   ``This is a threat to our most elemental rights, against our
democratic stability, and against our societies that want
well-being and freedom,'' he said.
   Lusinchi earlier this month sent a financial mission to the
United States and Europe to seek new debt financing.
   Venezuelan officials claim commercial bank creditors have
reneged on a promise included in a 1987 partial debt refinancing to
provide Venezuela with new funds and help it regain access to
international financial markets.
   But despite recent rumors that Venezuela might declare a
unilateral debt payment moratorium, Lusinchi and other top
administration officials have said any suspension of payments would
occur only if the financial mission failed and only in concert with
commercial banks.
