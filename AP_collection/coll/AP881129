   A helicopter flying in the Persian Gulf last
summer only wanted to shoot film for NBC News, but a U.S. destroyer
almost blew it out of the sky when the crew failed to respond to
repeated warnings.
   News helicopters around the world are becoming more aggressive in
their quest for the best pictures. Pilots and officials now are
taking steps to avoid disaster, to strike a balance between the
First Amendment and public safety.
   Following last May's $7-million Redondo Beach pier fire near Los
Angeles, news pilot Bob Tur was criticized for fanning smoke and
flames, endangering firefighters, and hampering radio communications
with noise.
   ``We can be a pain,'' acknowledged Tur, who is currently
appealing a 180-day license suspension for an unrelated infraction.
   But he denied he hovered too close, and said that wasn't the real
reason for his problems. ``People sometimes don't want publicity.
But if the media didn't tell you, who would?''
   More news choppers are buzzing the skies above big news events,
from earthquakes to chemical spills. Often, it's the only way
television crews or newspaper photographers can grab pictures of a
distant sea rescue or landslide before deadline.
   Not too long ago, only the three major television stations in Los
Angeles and the Los Angeles Times used helicopters, said Mike
Dreesman, whose Helitac Aviation currently flies for The Associated
Press and other news organizations. Nowadays, photographers from
such publications as the National Enquirer spend hours each week
airborne.
   ``We ask (the news helicopters) to back off and most of them are
pretty polite about it,'' said Sgt. Brent Carey of the police Air
Support Division. ``Others are pretty persistent. They want to keep
taking their pictures and at times it becomes an annoyance.''
   These days, teamwork among helicopters begins to play a more
important role _ and that's not the most common trait in such a
competitive business.
   ``There's no problem in and around a major event when pilots
communicate,'' said Bob Pettee, who flies for KNBC-TV. ``The only
problem is when somebody does something unexpected.''
   Pettee said experienced news pilots can shoot a chemical spill
without stirring up toxic gas, stay far enough away from a hostage
situation to avoid exciting a gunman, and cooperate with other
pilots on the scene.
   Sometimes they even help officials by tracking fires or flying
out victims, he said.
   Complaints were common before the Federal Aviation Administration
limited flights around disasters in 1985, the FAA's Joann Sloan
said. The restrictions allow local officials to ask the FAA to
declare fires, crashes and other incidents off-limits to aircraft
for safety reasons.
   News aircraft are permitted only if they file a flight plan, fly
above rescue aircraft, obey on-site authorities, and follow other
rules.
   Los Angeles fire and law enforcement officials said they
coordinate coverage with news helicopters as they show up on the
scene.
   ``I think the FAA thinks they have things under control,'' said
Ms. Sloan. ``We haven't had any disasters occur with these (news)
helicopters that I know of anytime recently.''
   But last December Jim Burnett, then-Chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, cited helicopter problems in asking the
FAA to tighten controls around disaster sites.
   Burnett cited six incidents since 1974 where news helicopters
worsened hazards or hampered rescue efforts. These included stirring
up fumes and dust around spills of hazardous materials, a fatal
crash over a chemical fire, and distracting ground rescue crews.
   ``These incidents illustrate how non-rescue aircraft can
interfere with rescue and clean-up activities and endanger the lives
and health of the occupants of the aircraft, the victims of the
accident, and the emergency response personnel responding to the
fire or hazardous materials incident,'' Burnett wrote.
   FAA Administrator T. Allan McArtor declined to issue new rules in
March, but he pledged the FAA would impose a 180-day license
suspension for pilots ignoring flight restrictions.
   Tur knows all about such suspensions. The pilot, whose company
sells videotape to several television stations, ran into trouble
with federal officials in March 1987 over the Air National Guard jet
fighter crash that killed Dean Paul Martin, son of entertainer Dean
Martin.
   The FAA honored a request by search officials to issue flight
restrictions around the crash site in the San Bernardino Mountains
east of Los Angeles, according to testimony at a suspension hearing
last September.
   Tur was warned away from the area by an Air Force colonel on the
scene. But he flew by to shoot late afternoon pictures of searchers
combing the steep, brush-filled mountainside for debris and bodies.
Other news crews were escorted over the scene at a higher altitude.
   Tur contended that flights were restricted only to avoid
publicity.
   ``Never can a local, state, or federal agency prevent news media
representatives from flying into an area because public relations
doesn't want the story told,'' he said.
   But Col. Charles K. Cross, the Air Force officer at the site,
testified news helicopters posed a safety threat. He said Tur's
noisy flight ``significantly disrupted my coordination efforts'' by
distracting searchers, and jeopardized their safety.
   Like Tur, the late Leo Galanis of Denver's KUSA-TV, who was head
of the National Broadcast Pilots Association, felt the Martin crash
site was restricted merely to curb publicity.
   ``I think it's obvious if it was not Dean Martin's son there
would not have been a (restriction) in effect,'' Galanis said in an
interview a few weeks before his own death in a helicopter crash.
   Galanis and cameraman Brian Hostetler were returning from
covering a plane crash Oct. 19 when their helicopter became
entangled in a utility cable and crashed southwest of Denver. Both
men were killed.
   Blocking or limiting media helicopters, Galanis said in the
interview, ``prevents the public from seeing events that they're
entitled to see under the First Amendment.''

   In Japanese this country is called Nippon or
sometimes Nihon, and therein lies a seed of debate.
   ``Why is our country called Japan? Its `official' name is
Nippon,'' Kazuo Sato wrote in a letter published in September by the
Asahi Shimbun, provoking a minor flood of other readers' letters.
   The 26-year-old student from Tokyo argued that Japan should
``unanimously use Nippon'' as its own name on the international
level _ on athletes' uniforms when they compete abroad, for instance.
   One of the editors of Asahi's letters section thought the flurry
of response and comment was slightly alarming _ a possible sign of
nationalistic feelings at a time when Emperor Hirohito was gravely
ill.
   ``It is a bit scary that people are interested in such a issue
especially under the current situation, when the emperor's illness
has been affecting the country,'' he said, asking that he not be
named.
   But the editor thought it was good for the letters columns to be
used to debate the issue.
   ``I guess it would be easier if we could choose one (name), but
we cannot decide which should be legitimate,'' he said.
   Not everybody is sensitive about the country's name, or worried
that Japan is getting nationalistic.
   A foreign relations specialist and conservative writer, Hideaki
Kase, said, ``I think it's fine to have a few different names. There
seems to be no problem using either Japan or Nippon. ... It has
nothing to do with nationalism.''
   A Foreign Ministry official said there are no rules on how to
name countries in other languages, and he noted that Japan is
spelled Japon in Spanish and pronounced like ``hapon.''
   But what should Japanese athletes wear on their uniforms for
international competition? No one but the Chinese would be able to
recognize Japan's name written in the Chinese characters, which
Japan borrowed to make a writing system centuries ago, so it has to
be written in the Roman alphabet, called romaji in Japanese.
   Kayoko Yamamoto, a spokesman for the Japan Amateur Sports
Association, said the organization provides uniforms emblazoned
``Japan'' for international athletic events.
   ``For major international events, we use Japan as the country's
official name, because English is the most common language,'' she
said.
   But there's no firm rule, and some teams also go with Nippon.
   Masaaki Obana of the Japan Volleyball Association said the
national volleyball team has both Japan and Nippon uniforms but
players wear Nippon more often in international contests.
   ``Either way, they're our country's names. We don't think we
should be using only one of the two,'' Obana said.
   After Sato's letter was published, the volleyball association
received many inquiries asking which name is official, because
Japanese volleyball players wore their Nippon uniforms at the summer
Olympics games in Seoul, South Korea.
   The Asahi editor said the newspaper, Japan's second-largest
circulation daily, received about 10 letters on the issues.
   Karen Blahitka from Yamaguchi prefecture in southwestern Japan
wrote that she was against using Nippon because many languages as
well as Japanese translate foreign countries' names into their own
tongue, and English-speaking countries are no exception.
   ``For example, Bundesrepublik Deutschland is the Federal Republic
of Germany or colloquially West Germany in English, and `Nishi
Doitsu' in Japanese,'' she said.
   Teacher Tatsuya Akizuki, 36, wrote: ``It is a huge task to change
the way a country's name or person's name, which has already become
fixed in our daily lives, is pronounced.''
   ``If Japanese are told to accurately pronounce country names and
names of people in the languages of the respective countries, we
would be in trouble,'' he added.
   The origin of the name Japan is not certain, but researchers say
it probably came from the Malayan ``Japung'' or the Chinese
``Riben,'' meaning roughly land of the rising sun.
   Historians say the Japanese called their country Yamato in its
early history, and they began using Nippon around the seventh
century. Nippon and Nihon are used interchangeably as the country's
name.

   Some people celebrate April Fool's Day by
playing pranks, St. Patrick's Day with a toast to the Irish and
Thanksgiving Day with a turkey. Sandy Moore has celebrated all three
by having babies.
   Mrs. Moore, 33, of Indiana Township gave birth to Jason, 9
pounds, 1 ounce, on Thanksgiving Day in West Penn Hospital in
Pittsburgh.
   Mother and baby were doing fine.
   Jason is the third holiday baby for Mrs. Moore and her 33
year-old husband, Martin.
   Their oldest child, Amanda, arrived on April Fool's Day 1982, and
their second child, Jacquelyn, was born in St. Patrick's Day 1984.
   Mrs. Moore attributes the birthdays to luck.
   ``All this has made me really happy,'' she said Monday night.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper columnist's beef about litterbugs
got him into trouble on the city streets he's trying to keep clean.
   A few weeks ago, The Philadelphia Inquirer's Clark DeLeon wrote a
column criticizing litterbugs and criticizing himself for not
standing up to them. He swore, in print, that next time he saw a
litterbug, he would say something.
   He got his opportunity Saturday, along with six stitches for his
effort.
   DeLeon, in his column Monday, wrote he and his wife were driving
in the city when they saw four teen-agers throw two large beverage
containers out of a car with New Jersey license plates.
   DeLeon got out of his car, picked up the containers and gave them
back to the driver, saying, ``Do me a favor, pal, take these back to
Jersey with you.''
   About a block later, while both cars were stuck in traffic, three
teen-agers from the other car ran up to DeLeon's. When DeLeon got
out, he said, one ``whacked'' him from behind before they fled.
   DeLeon said he received six stitches about an inch below his
right eye, where his glasses dug into his cheekbone when he was hit.
   He wrote that the doctor in the emergency room congratulated him
for ``doing what she has often wanted to do but has been afraid to
do for reasons that were as clear as the face in front of her.''

<HEAD>Bendjedid Reinforces His Authority For Further Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid, promising to
usher in a new era of liberal reforms, solidified his power during a
meeting of the nation's only party and virtually assured himself of
another five years in office.
   The National Liberation Front wrapped up its two-day congress
late Monday night by electing a new, 155-member Central Committee,
which then designated Bendjedid as its secretary-general.
   The head of the party automatically becomes sole candidate in the
presidential elections, which the congress set for Dec. 22.
Bendjedid thus will win a third five-year term as head of this
one-party socialist state.
   But Bendjedid now must confront the growing economic and social
problems that exploded into bloody riots in early October. Official
reports said 176 died in the protests, but unofficial estimates put
the death toll at 500.
   ``I need your help because the mission is difficult, the task is
long and the problems are great,'' Bendjedid told the 5,078 congress
delegates in his closing speech.
   ``The renewal of your confidence is a support for the political
reform proposals, of which a part already have been applied and
others are going to be. I promise to do my best to implement your
political program.''
   Many Algerians, however, were hoping that the congress would
approve a multiparty political system.
   Bendjedid said during the congress that such a move was possible
in the future, but he contended it could harm national unity at the
present time.
   It was not know at the end of the congress what form Bendjedid's
reforms would take.
   The October riots were staged by Algerians upset with high
unemployment, rising prices and a shortage of housing. The protests
prompted Bendjedid to promise a more liberal political system and
less central control.
   Bendjedid has been trying for the past two years to institute
reforms, particularly breaking the grip of the party on the
day-to-day running of the country. That effort was accelerated by
the violence in October.
   He told the congress that a package of reforms would be presented
to Parliament soon, but did not detail what they would contain.
   Abdelhamid Mehri, the No. 2 man in the party, said that although
a multiparty system had been rejected for the immediate future, free
candidacies for some elected offices would be allowed.
   That means non-party members may run for local assemblies and the
national Parliament.
   The new Central Committee was comprised almost equally of
delegates elected from local cells; from government and party
functionaries; and from union and professional organizations.
   That appeared to bring in the new blood Bendjedid was seeking and
end the domination of party militants that characterized the
outgoing committee.
   After the October riots, the government quickly held a referendum
to win approval of the first phase of reforms. Those consisted
mainly of changes to the constitution.
   Among those changes was according new power to the premier and
making him directly responsible to the Parliament rather than the
president. Shortly after the Nov. 3 referendum, Bendjedid appointed
a new premier, Kasdi Merbah, and a government made up largely of
technicians rather than professional party militants.
   Algeria's debt is estimated at $23 billion. The nation also has
faced a dramatic fall in the price of oil _ the country's main
export _ during the past two years, and an unemployment rate of 22
percent.

   A young reserve soldier whose face was burned
and mutilated by a firebomb went on television to ask fellow
Israelis to show some understanding and stop staring at him.
   Shimon Navon, a 25-year-old university student, was doing his
required duty in the occupied West Bank last June when Palestinians
hurled a firebomb at his jeep. His face was disfigured and all his
fingers had to be amputated.
   He decided to appear on an Israeli TV talk show Monday night, he
said, because his countrymen react so cruelly when they encounter
victims like himself in public.
   ``All the stares lock on you,'' he said. ``Sometimes it's
helplessness, or even fear. ... People just have no tact and they
shout things, like, `Look at this weirdo, look at this creature!'
   ``As though we are not living in a country where people should
know about this phenomenom. It happens a lot and I'm not the only
one; there are a lot like me.''
   Navon's entire face is covered with burns and scar tissue. His
ears were burned off. His fingerless hands are still wrapped in
bandages.
   He appeared on TV with his girlfriend, Miri Amiel. They began
dating about six months before he was hurt, and Ms. Amiel said they
were closer now than ever.
   ``Before, we were like any couple, going out together, studying
together, having fun. ... Now we have to deal with all these things
together,'' she said. ``Of course, Shimon has to deal with it more
than I, but I am a partner in everything.''
   They met at college, where he was taking a preparatory course
before studying for a degree.
   Amiel said she, too, is pained by the public's reaction.
   ``It's very sad for me ... to see all the stares, and hope that
Shimon doesn't notice,'' she said.
   Tragedy struck Navon at 11 p.m. on June 14, the last day of his
unit's 24-day tour of duty in the occupied areas. His jeep entered
Beit Umar village for one last patrol before returning to base for a
farewell party.
   ``I didn't want to do the extra round because it was late,'' he
said. ``I felt a ... strange feeling. ... After a moment or two I
felt the Molotov cocktail. All of me was burning. ... I couldn't
open the door to get out of the jeep.''
   Since then, Navon has undergone more than a dozen operations and
skin transplants.
   He said he began crying when he realized what he looked like and
``my brother and my girlfriend ... also started crying. ... A few
minutes later I said, O.K., guys, calm down, everything will be all
right, this isn't going to break me.''
   The television showed a photograph of Navon and Amiel, taken
before the attack and portraying a handsome young man in army
uniform.
   ``I was always a pretty realistic and rational type,'' Navon
said. ``This new situation is not simple and not easy ... but it
won't help to complain or ask why I look like this.''
   He said he was appealing to Israeli society to be kinder to burn
victims not for himself but because other burn victims were more
sensitive than he.
   At least 10 people have suffered serious burns in firebomb
attacks in the past year _ a frequent weapon in the yearlong
Palestinian uprising that has killed more than 300 Palestinians and
11 Israelis.
   Navon said he harbors no desire for revenge and no feelings of
hatred toward the Palestinians who attacked him.
   He said Palestinian insurrectionists have ``a struggle of their
own, and the way they're doing it, with violence, they won't
accomplish anything. They must sit and talk this problem out.''

<HEAD>Town Meeting Backs Off Ban On Plastic Food Containers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A town meeting Monday endorsed the idea of
reducing the use of polystyrene coffee cups and other plastic food
containers but backed down from a complete ban on the non-recyclable
materials.
   A group called Foam Free Amherst sponsored the proposal to ban
the sale of plastic foam food containers in the town of 35,000
people, home to Amherst College and the University of Massachusetts.
   Townspeople voted instead on a substitute motion calling on the
town to ``endorse the goals of reducing the use of non-recyclable
plastics,'' educate vendors and users about cutting back, and
encourage use of alternatives.
   There was no discussion of the original motion at town meeting.
But Thomas W. Hutcheson, who sponsored the substitute measure, said
Foam Free Amherst supported the replacement. The motion passed by
voice vote.
   The aim of the original proposal was to discourage the use of
plastics because they take up considerable space in the town dump
and create gases that deplete the earth's ozone layer when
manufactured and burned, according to sponsor Cynthia Pauley.
   A spokesman for the Polystyrene Packaging Council, a trade group
in Washington, D.C., defended the plastic by saying that researchers
have found fast-food packaging takes up only one-quarter of 1
percent of landfills in weight and volume.
   Moreover, Betsy DeCampos said, the polystyrene industry has
voluntarily agreed to stop using chlorofluoromethane in the
manufacture of plastic cups by January out of concern for the
earth's ozone layer.
   Amherst was one of several communities across the nation to take
a closer look at polystyrene cups and consider bans that DeCampos
called ``a quick fix to the solid waste issue.''
   Bans already are in effect in Berkeley, Calif., and Suffolk
County, N.Y. In Massachusetts, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has issued an
executive order effective July 1989 banning state agencies from
purchasing plastic foam food packaging.

   In a city where image is everything,
city planners are prescribing a face lift.
   They're recommending ``designer'' sidewalks, flower planters and
novel street lamps to counter fears that cracked sidewalks and
traffic-clogged streets will send shoppers elsewhere.
   ``It's a critical step forward in giving a face lift to a city
which is in desperate need to maintain its beauty and attractiveness
and keep its kind of garden-spot-of-the-world atmosphere,'' Mayor
Robert K. Tanenbaum said.
   The entire revitalization plan for the 30-block business district
could run $80 million. City Council said it would study the proposal.
   Plans include $2 million for flower planters, $715,000 for
sprinklers, $10.4 million for scored concrete sidewalks with granite
bands, $3.3 million for street lamps, $1 million to widen sidewalks
on Rodeo Drive and Brighton Way, $1.5 million for pedestrian
gateways and $1 million to landscape the middle of Wilshire
Boulevard.
   ``Are we slipping? Not a bit,'' said Karl Shurz, Chamber of
Commerce president. ``But to maintain our present position of total
excellence we have to keep our guard up. That's what, basically, the
city is very concerned about. Maintaining the image.''

   Stumped for a Christmas present for the person who
has everything? How about a bridge.
   The state Highway Department has honest-to-goodness historic
bridges available to anyone who will give them good homes and will
haul them away.
   But seriously, who would want a bridge?
   Cities, counties, park and recreation districts, land developers
_ anyone who wants to preserve some road history and save some of
the enormous cost of building a new trestle is interested in the
bridges, said Sally Pearce, staff historian for the department.
   Bridges in the 3-year-old ``Adopt-A-Bridge'' program are
scheduled for replacement because they are deteriorating or
impractical for modern traffic.
   Eighteen bridges, most made of steel trusses, are eligible for
the program, Pearce said. But so far only three have reached some
stage of being moved mainly because of the difficulties in
relocating them.
   Moving expenses vary. For example, to disassemble and relocate
all four, 185-foot-long spans of the Fifth Street Bridge in Grand
Junction is estimated to cost between $360,000 and $480,000. For a
single span: $120,000.

   Police used loudspeakers and flyers Monday to warn
residents about a dangerous mixture of gas and kerosene that
mistakenly was sold for use in space heaters.
   The fuel could cause fire or explosion if used in heating
devices, Lt. David Boggs said.
   ``We've got squad cars going up and down streets in two police
districts using their public address systems to warn people, and
officers are handing out flyers to people on the street,'' Boggs
said.
   ``We're also getting very good cooperation from radio and
television stations,'' he said.
   On Saturday, a fuel company delivered gas to a Martin Oil Co.
service station, but mistakenly poured 1,640 gallons into a kerosene
tank, Boggs said.
   ``They didn't discover the error until early Monday,'' the
lieutenant said, ``but they estimate that there were about 4,100
gallons of kerosene in the tank.
   ``That would make the mix about three-to-one,'' Boggs said. ``The
owner estimates they sold from 730 to 800 gallons of the kerosene
before learning that there was gasoline in it.''
   By late Monday night, consumers had returned at least 200 gallons
to the station, and only one minor fire had been linked to the
mixture, officials said.

   At least one of the 100-odd American
ambassadors that President-elect George Bush must select could rank
in importance with many of the Cabinet choices now drawing most of
the nation's attention.
   Bush must select the successor to former Senate Democratic leader
Mike Mansfield, retiring after a record 11 years as ambassador to
Tokyo.
   The job is important simply because Japan has become so important
to America in the late 20th Century.
   Together the two countries account for 40 to 50 percent of world
economic output. They have one of the world's most complex,
emotionally-charged and changing relationships.
   Mansfield calls the U.S.-Japanese relationship the most important
in the world and says that during his tenure in Tokyo it has changed
from that of uncle-nephew to brother-brother.
   Complicating the love-hate feelings often felt between the
countries are deep cultural and language differences and Japan's new
world importance.
   In only four decades, Japan has transformed itself from a humble,
defeated American enemy to a U.S. protege and loyal ally, an
economic superpower and rival, U.S. creditor, landlord and
occasional critic.
   During the election campaign, Bush took positions on issues such
as Japan's military and foreign aid role and trade.
   To demands that Japan increase military spending and relieve some
of the U.S. defense burden, Bush _ a bomber pilot against Japan in
World War II _ noted that Japan's Asian neighbors still remember the
war and ``remain very sensitive to the issue of Japanese
rearmament.''
   He suggested that Japan rapidly boost its share of global
economic aid, a category in which it is about to surpass the United
States. But that, too, could create other conflicts, because Japan
is already becoming a rival to U.S. dominance of such international
institutions as the World Bank.
   On trade, Bush is expected to take President Reagan's general
line of seeking to brake protectionist efforts to restrict Japanese
imports into the United States while encouraging sharpened U.S.
competitiveness.
   Reagan and Yasuhiro Nakasone, the Japanese prime minister from
1982-87, developed a first-name relationship unprecedented in the
two countries' history. Their personal connection helped the nations
weather a rough period marked by U.S. pressure against Japanese
domestic barriers, alleged unfair trade practices and insular
thinking inappropriate for a country grown rich by exporting.
   Noboru Takeshita, Nakasone's successor, said during a White House
visit that he also had gotten on a first-name basis with the U.S.
president. Tokyo news reports say he hopes to visit Washington early
in the Bush presidency to cultivate the same kind of relations.
   After 14 years as Senate Democratic leader, Mansfield was sent to
Japan by Democratic President Jimmy Carter. In 1981 Reagan asked him
to stay in the increasingly important post.
   Announcing his retirement, Mansfield said he felt he could leave
``with our heads high.'' The U.S. trade deficit with Japan,
accounting for $57 billion of a global deficit of $170 billion in
1987, is finally narrowing, he said, as a result of hard-bargained
market-openings, the costlier yen and cheaper dollar and efforts by
Nakasone and Takeshita to boost Japanese domestic consumption and
imports.
   But new flareups can be expected between two countries that have
such different backgrounds but are now so economically
interdependent.
   Pressure from the Democratic-controlled Congress for all U.S.
allies to shoulder more defense costs promises to affect
U.S.-Japanese relations. Members ask why the United States with all
its deficit problems should spend 6 percent of gross national
product on defense, while Japan devotes just 1 percent of its wealth
to the same purpose.
   But Pentagon officials dispute the idea that Japan enjoys a
``free ride,'' arguing that it provides the bulk of the destroyers
and combat jets in Northeast Asia, that its military budget of $30
billion a year is already higher than that of any other U.S. ally,
and that its contribution of $45,000 to the annual upkeep of each of
the 55,000 U.S. military personnel based in Japan is the most
generous in the world.
   Tension also continues over an issue raised by presidential
contender Michael Dukakis and other Democrats, the ``buying up of
America'' in the form of Japanese investments in prime U.S. real
estate and factories. Defenders such as Mansfield ask why nobody
complains about Britain's $75 billion worth of direct investment in
America, compared to Japanese investments of $33 billion.
   Names mentioned as early candidates for the Tokyo post include
Michael H. Armacost, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
who has served in Tokyo; Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs; and Lamar Alexander, the former
Tennessee governor instrumental in bringing Japanese factories to
his state.
   Economic relations between America and Japan ``are so large and
so crucial to both countries that unless we manage them
intelligently, we could be facing a crisis of enormous dimensions,''
says Martin Weinstein, head of Japan programs at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based private
research organization.
   ``If the Japanese didn't buy our Treasury bonds, our debt would
be simply unmanageable,'' Weinstein says. ``No other country is in
that position.''

<HEAD>Black Ink in Farm Trade More Than Doubles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm exports soared to a six-year peak of 147.5
million metric tons in the year that ended Sept. 30, and black ink
in U.S. agricultural trade doubled to more than $14 billion, the
Agriculture Department says.
   Japan was again the top customer of the American farmer, as it
has been for more than two decades, according to figures released
Monday.
   American farm exports climbed from $27.87 billion in fiscal 1987
to $35.2 billion this past fiscal year, a gain of 26 percent, while
imports of farm products were up 2 percent to a record $21 billion,
USDA said.
   The United States was thus left with a net agricultural trade
surplus of $14.2 billion for fiscal 1988, compared with $7.22
billion a year earlier.
   Volume of exports climbed 14 percent from the 129.2 million
metric tons posted in fiscal 1987, with wheat accounting for
two-thirds of the increase, USDA said. A metric ton is equivalent to
about 2,205 pounds.
   Exports of wheat increased from 28.2 million metric tons in 1987
to 40.5 million tons in the last fiscal year. The Soviet Union and
China together purchased a total of 14.6 million tons, or 36 percent
of all U.S. wheat shipments in fiscal 1988.
   Combined imports by the Soviet Union and China totaled 4.95
million metric tons of American wheat in 1987, or 18 percent of all
shipments.
   Japan imported 27.8 million metric tons of U.S. agricultural
goods. Other leading purchasers were: the European Community, 25.5
million metric tons; the Soviet Union, 15.9 million metric tons;
South Korea, 8 million; and Taiwan, 7.3 million.
   Besides wheat, substantial gains were posted by corn, grain
sorghum, feeds and fodders and vegetable oils. Among products not
measured on the basis of metric tons, the biggest gains were in baby
chicks, live animals, fruit juices, wines and malt beverages.
   The increases were moderated, however, by weakened foreign demand
for U.S. soybeans, soybean meal and rice.
   All of the nation's leading foreign markets for farm goods grew
in fiscal 1988 except that of the European Community, whose imports
dropped nearly 1.1 million metric tons. The decrease mainly
reflected fewer purchases of soybean and soybean meal.
   The Soviet Union and Japan were among the five fastest-growing
markets for U.S. agriculture, joining China, Algeria and India.
   American high-value exports such as livestock and horticultural
products climbed to a record $16.4 billion in 1988, a gain of $2.7
billion or 19 percent over the 1987 level. It also represented a
$1.1 billion gain over the previous peak, reached in 1981.
   Shipments of bulk commodities such as grains zoomed 33 percent
from 1987 to a total of $18.8 billion. The level topped $25 billion
in 1984 before immense crop surpluses and stiffer foreign
competition battered prices and sent American agriculture into the
doldrums.
   Expanded purchases of wheat and corn were the main reason for the
increase, USDA said. It said the Soviet Union, China and North
Africa were the leading markets for wheat and Japan, while the
Soviet Union and South Korea were tops for corn.
   Agricultural imports of $21 billion were some $250 million or 2
percent above the 1987 level and about $100 million over the 1986
mark of $20.9 billion, the previous record high. USDA said the
increase was not limited to any single commodity group but instead
reflected modest increases in nearly all major competitive items.
   Top suppliers were: the European Community, $4.12 billion;
Canada, $2.37 billion; Mexico, $1.9 billion; Brazil, $1.9 billion
and Australia, $1.15 billion. Products reflecting increases were
vegetable oil, live cattle, beef and veal, wines and malt beverages
and nursery products.
   Imports of sugar, pork, fur, coffee and spices all dropped.

<HEAD>Administration Opts Against Limitation on Bearing Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The domestic bearing industry is operating at
or near 100 percent capacity, the Reagan administration said in
declining to limit imports of the friction-reducing components from
Europe and Japan.
   The decision, announced Monday, follows a joint study by the
Commerce and Defense departments. The Commerce Department had found
separately in July that U.S. bearing manufacturers would not be able
to meet ``all national security requirements in the event of a major
conventional war.''
   But President Reagan in August tentatively ruled out limits until
the joint study could be completed. The administration wanted to
ensure that the domestic bearing industry would be sufficiently
healthy to meet production needs in the event of an emergency,
without the United States having to rely on outside suppliers.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the joint study found
that conditions in the domestic bearing industry had improved
signficantly in the last several months. His statement said that it
was concluded that ``administration initiatives should be adequate
to bring the domestic industrial base into an acceptable posture for
national security purposes.''
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said in a statement that
Reagan's decision was made ``after a thorough review of the impact
of bearing imports on national security.''
   ``While recognizing the critical importance of bearings to
defense preparedness, other administration initiatives already under
way _ coupled with significantly improved economic conditions for
the industry _ make me confident that this is the right decision,''
he said.
   The decision against moving to curb imports of bearings was based
on these conclusions of the government investigators:
   _Current demand for bearings in the United States is at its
highest level in recent years, particularly as bearing-consuming
industries such as automobiles, aerospace and off-road equipment
experience heavy sales increases.
   _The U.S. bearing industry has benefited from substantial
increases in domestic demand and is operating at or near 100 percent
of capacity.
   _The industry has attracted ``significant investment'' from both
domestic- and foreign-owned producers.
   _A change in Defense Department acquisition guidelines last
August, which now require the Pentagon to use only domestic
industries for the purchase of bearings for defense-related
equipment. This could provide the domestic industry with an
estimated $40 million to $50 million in additional revenue for
domestic suppliers.
   In a separate and unrelated action, the Commerce Department said
it was ``aggressively pursuing'' an investigation of alleged unfair
trade practices by foreign suppliers of anti-friction bearings.
   ``Our preliminary findings indicate dumping margins in the 20 to
80 percent range,'' Verity said. ``If the final results of this
investigation verify these margins, the duties imposed could
contribute to leveling the playing field for this important
industry.''
   He said that a final determination on the issue of dumping of
bearings by foreign competitors in the U.S. market will be due Jan.
9, and a decision will be made 45 days later on what kind of actions
to take.
   Dumping is the selling of a product in a foreign market at a
price lower than the domestic price.

<TEXT>
   Marlin Fitzwater, signed on for another hitch
as White House spokesman, says President-elect George Bush ``will
have new ways of dealing with the press'' that may include more
informal meetings with reporters.
   Fitzwater, 46, has been President Reagan's chief spokesman since
February 1987 and was Vice President Bush's press secretary for two
years before that.
   Bush, making his first appearance in the White House press
briefing room since his election Nov. 8, announced Monday that he is
retaining Fitzwater.
   It is the first time the press secretary of an outgoing president
has been named permanently to the job in a new administration,
although Pierre Salinger served President Johnson for an interim
after President Kennedy's assassination.
   Fitzwater declined to say how frequently Bush would hold
presidential news conferences, saying: ``The vice president has been
holding press conferences at the rate of one every five hours for
the last few weeks, so we'll have to see how that works out.
   ``The new president, I'm sure, will have new ways of dealing with
the press. I'm sure there will be all kinds of interviews and press
conferences and meetings.''
   When a reporter observed that Bush seems more comfortable than
Reagan in freewheeling give-and-take with reporters, Fitzwater said,
``I would agree with you that the president-elect is comfortable
with the press, he does operate informally quite effectively.''
   ``So I would suspect you might see a lot more informal _ ,'' the
spokesman said, at which point his response was cut off by a
reporter's question as to what he would recommend in the way of news
conferences.
   ``I won't talk about all the things I've recommended and not
recommended, but we'll just have to wait and see,'' he said.
   ``I think there should be as much contact with the press as
possible and it should be as regular as possible,'' the spokesman
said.
   Fitzwater is a veteran public affairs official whose federal
career began in 1972 when he was a speechwriter for Secretary of
Transportation John Volpe. Before that, Fitzwater had worked for
newspapers in his native Kansas.
   ``I think he's the best,'' Bush said. ``He represents the old and
the new. He represents the Reagan administration and he also
represents the Bush administration. ... This is continuity in the
best sense.''
   When asked if he would hold more frequent news conferences than
Reagan, the president-elect said, ``I`m going to lean heavily on
Marlin for advice on this.''
   Fitzwater's present title is assistant to the president for press
relations. Bush said that in the new administration Fitzwater will
be press secretary, a title held now by James Brady, who was wounded
in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan.
   When asked whether Brady would have a role in the new
administration, Fitzwater said, ``I know the vice president is very
interested in Jim and concerned about his well-being'' and that Bush
and his advisers ``have some ideas of things they would like him to
do.''
   Fitzwater said Sheila Tate would remain Bush's press secretary
through the transition, and he would take over on Jan. 20. Ms. Tate
has said she plans to leave government.
   After Bush left the briefing room, Fitzwater opened his
presentation with a few words of gratitude to the president-elect
and president.
   Then a reporter asked him, ``Well, will you keep avoiding
briefings and will you promise to hold more news conferences?''
   ``A two-minute honeymoon,'' Fitzwater said. ``Amazing.''

<HEAD>US-Soviet Grain Agreement Extended for 27 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration hailed the new
U.S.-Soviet grain agreement as providing a steady market for
American farm products, but a congressman from America's wheat belt
said the deal sold growers short.
   The plan ``stabilizes grain trade between our two countries by
ensuring a secure source of supply for Soviet grain imports and
secure market for U.S. grain exports,'' said a statement from Alan
F. Holmer, chief of the U.S. delegation to the Moscow meetings.
   Under a 27-month extension of the long-term agreement between the
two nations, the Soviet Union is promising to buy at the equivalent
of at least 9 million metric tons annually of U.S. grain. A metric
ton equals about 2,205 pounds.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators signed the extension in Moscow on
Monday, breathing new life into a five-year plan that helped to turn
the Soviet Union into one of the U.S. farmer's best customers. That
agreement had expired Sept. 30.
   ``The extension will continue to stabilize grain trade between
the two countries, benefiting American farmers,'' Agriculture
Secretary Richard E. Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K.
Yeutter said in a statement.
   The agreement calls for the Soviets to buy at least 4 million
metric tons each of wheat and corn annually as well as 1 million
metric tons of additional wheat, corn, soybeans and soybean meal, or
any combination of those commodities.
   The Soviets also are allowed to purchase up to 3 million metric
tons of additional wheat and corn annually without further
discussions.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., and chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee's subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains, said
the pact has ``done nothing more than maintain the current
agreement.''
   ``This was an historic opportunity with one of our most important
grain clients and all we can say is we didn't lose any ground,'' he
said. ``That simply isn't good enough.''
   ``This administration has driven down the price of grain in order
to export more, but they don't seem to be able to close the deal,''
he said.
   The Agriculture Department said the Soviets bought 9.05 million
tons of wheat, 5.18 million tons of corn, 830,700 tons of soybeans
and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal for delivery in the fifth and
final year of the current agreement.
   The Soviets purchased U.S. wheat for the final year and a half of
the old agreement at federally subsidized prices under the
government's Export Enhancement Program, designed to offset
competition from the European Community and other suppliers.
   Under the 1985 program, the Agriculture Department pays private
exporters in kind out of stocks held by the government-owned
Commodity Credit Corp. to ship the grain at highly attractive
prices. There are no dollar estimates for these sales.
   A provision of the old plan carried over into the new version
allows the Soviets to count one ton of soybeans or soybean meal as
two tons and thus round out their purchase obligation by buying
500,000 tons of those commodities rather than a million tons of
wheat or corn.
   ``In general our impression is favorable,'' American Farm Bureau
Federation spokesman Joe Fields said. ``It's a continuation of what
we had before, which worked fairly well.''
   Barry Jenkins, a spokesman for the National Association of Wheat
Growers, said his members were pleased with the agreement but had
hoped that the amounts would have been a bit larger.
   In any case, he said, the plan was likely to have less effect on
prices than will lingering problems caused by the drought. He said
markets mainly would be relieved to get some assurance of continued
Soviet demand.
   ``It's like a security blanket for some people,'' Jenkins said.

<HEAD>GEORGE M. MITCHELL: Made His Name in Iran-Contra Hearings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. George Mitchell joined the Senate eight
years ago as an appointee who had never won election to public
office. But the Maine Democrat has since proven himself a popular
vote-getter, a thoughtful lawmaker and a telegenic party spokesman.
   Mitchell, a former federal judge, won praise for his incisive
questioning of witnesses before the Iran-Contra investigating panel
last year. He also hushed the hearing room with a statement as
dramatic as the emotional testimony of Lt. Col. Oliver North.
   ``Although he's regularly asked to do so, God does not take sides
in American politics,'' Mitchell lectured the Marine. ``And in
America, disagreement with the policies of the government is not
evidence of lack of patriotism.''
   Mitchell's Iran-Contra performance solidified his status as a
potential majority leader. He was first mentioned for the job in
1986 when, as the hard-working head of the Democrats' senatorial
campaign committee, he led his party back to control of the chamber.
   Mitchell, 55, had less legislative experience than his two
opponents for Senate majority leader and was perceived as more
liberal.
   As chairman of the Senate's environmental protection
subcommittee, Mitchell led a losing fight this year for an
anti-pollution bill designed to reduce acid rain, smog and airborne
toxic chemicals. His powerful opponents included the current Senate
majority leader, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, and Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee. Mitchell also chairs the Finance Committee's health panel
and has proposed a major long-term health care initiative.
   Mitchell was appointed to the Senate in 1980 to succeed Edmund
Muskie, whom he had served as an executive assistant two decades
earlier. He won election in 1982 with 61 percent of the vote and
garnered 81 percent this year.
   The son of a utility company laborer and a Lebanese immigrant
mother who worked the midnight shift at a woolen mill for 27 years,
Mitchell graduated from Bowdoin College, spent two years as an Army
intelligence officer and worked as an insurance claims adjuster
while attending night classes at Georgetown University law school.
   Mitchell lost a 1974 bid to become governor of Maine. He was
appointed U.S. attorney for the state in 1977 and two years later
was named to a new federal judgeship in Bangor.

<HEAD>DANIEL K. INOUYE: A Deep-Voiced Presence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, the most senior of
three candidates for Senate majority leader, is known for his
solemn, deep-voiced presence which commands attention whether during
a floor debate or at a hearing.
   Inouye, who has been a senator since 1962, earned national
prominence first as keynote speaker at the Democratic National
Convention in 1968, then gained added respect as a member of the
Senate Watergate committee in 1973. But the gloss was dulled
somewhat last year when Inouye was criticized for not keeping a firm
enough handle on hearings before the Iran-Contra investigating panel
he helped chair.
   In that post and as former Intelligence Committee chairman and a
senior member of the Appropriations Committee, Inouye has prided
himself on being able to work closely with Republicans. But he also
has been a party loyalist, backing President Johnson's Vietnam War
policy and defending Sen. Harrison Williams, D-N.J., in 1981 against
expulsion in the Abscam case.
   His colleagues made him secretary of the Democratic Conference,
the No. 3 party leadership position, leading many to rank him a year
ago as the top prospect to succeed Robert Byrd of West Virginia as
majority leader. But in recent months, Inouye's chances seemed to
fade as some _ particularly newer senators _ searched for a less
ponderous figure to represent their numbers on television.
   Last year, Inouye was embarrassed after it was revealed that he
had slipped into a money bill $8 million for a school in France for
North African Jews. He later was forced to rescind the provision.
   In recent years, his voting record has tended toward the liberal
side: he has favored gun control, sanctions against South Africa and
limits on political action committee contributions to candidates. He
has opposed the Star Wars defense system and aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras.

<HEAD>J. BENNETT JOHNSTON: Cagey in the Senate's Back Rooms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston is an accomplished
power broker with a reputation of knowing how to swing legislative
deals while protecting his own interests.
   The Louisianan is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee and of the energy and water development appropriations
subcommittee, posts from which he watches out for his state and its
energy industry. That was seen by some observers as a possible
disadvantage in his race for majority leader, since the House
already is led by another oil and gas advocate, Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas.
   While known for an easygoing, quotable style, Johnston is quick
to master details of legislation, has a strong grasp of Senate
procedure and is considered a cagey backroom deal-maker.
   Johnston was more conservative than either of his two rivals for
majority leader. During his second term, he was a leading opponent
of court-ordered busing to desegregate schools.
   But he now casts himself as a centrist. He dramatically came out
against President Reagan's nomination of conservative Robert Bork to
the Supreme Court last year, supported a bill aimed at reducing
pollution that causes global warming, and fought Reagan's efforts to
finance the Star Wars missile defense system.
   In the majority leader's race, Johnston sold himself as the
candidate most likely to appeal to Middle America and thus as the
best standard-bearer for the Democratic Party. He picked up
endorsements from two of the party's stars, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas and Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia.
   Now 56, Johnston entered the Senate in 1973 after a nine-year
career in the Louisiana state legislature.

<HEAD>Study: Environmental Concerns to Influence Farm Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental concerns are likely to influence
the next comprehensive farm bill and threaten some farmers' incomes
unless agricultural interests adopt reforms on their own, a
researcher says
   Farmers must ``modify programs, or agriculture must be prepared
to face environmental legislation,'' says Katherine Reichelderfer,
coauthor of a paper released Monday by the National Center for Food
and Agricultural Policy. The center is part of the environmental
research organization Resources for the Future.
   The study noted that 37 states have passed or are considering
legislation aimed at agricultural contamination of water.
   Agriculture is already the largest source of some pollution, such
as nutrients reaching waterways. Pesticides have been found, for
example, in 40 percent of the wells in Iowa.
   The paper surveyed existing research documenting environmental
harm from farming as practiced today with massive government
involvement in restricting acreage, supporting farm income and
controlling supply.
   Growing environmental concern could mean modification of farm
subsidy programs or new environmental controls that could reduce the
income of some farmers, the study said.
   ``The net effect of the current combination of farm program
instruments include the following: More acreage is retained in the
agricultural sector than would be the case in the absence of farm
programs, but less acreage is cultivated and agricultural chemical
use rates and crop yields per acre are higher,'' the study said.
   Ending all price support programs while keeping current
conservation requirements would ``increase the number of acres
planted to crops, but would result in environmentally beneficial
relocation and mix of production activities, with less intensive and
less damaging use of agricultural chemicals on expanded acreage,''
it said.
   However, ``farm income would decline, agricultural exports would
fall and rural communities and agribusiness interests would suffer.''
   Reichelderfer said the environmental benefits ``probably (would)
not'' outweigh the costs.
   Nonetheless, ``polls have shown what I consider a rather dramatic
increase in public concern about agricultural sources of pollution,
particularly contamination of drinking water sources,'' she said.
   ``You're probably going to see even more participation by the
environmental community'' in shaping the next farm bill, tentatively
on the congressional agenda for 1990, said the study's other author,
Tim Phipps.
   Environmentalists were influential in adding the ``sodbuster''
and ``swampbuster'' provisions to the 1985 bill, forbidding
subsidies to farmers who convert grasslands and swamps to crops, and
in fashioning the conservation reserve, aimed at retiring 45 million
acres of erodible land from production through rent payments to
farmers who convert it to grassland or forest for 10 years.
   The paper discussed in detail three possible modifications to
current programs: removing the link between production and income
support that current commodity-oriented price supports provide;
gradually ending all price supports; and expansion of the
conservation reserve.
   Other possibilities mentioned were taxes on pesticides, subsidies
to encourage so-called ``low input'' farming or low-chemical
``integrated pest management,'' and more research on alternatives to
chemical-dependent farming.

   Actor Tom Cruise says working with veteran actors
such as Paul Newman and Dustin Hoffman is a learning experience.
   ``What you get from great actors like Newman and Hoffman is where
to focus your energies and what to worry about and what not to worry
about,'' Cruise said. ``Because as a young actor, you're worried
about everything.''
   Cruise, 26, starred with Newman in ``The Color of Money,'' and
with Hoffman in the to-be-released ``Rain Man.''
   In ``Rain Man,'' the 51-year-old Hoffman plays an autistic man
with remarkable powers of memory and a $3 million inheritance.
Cruise plays his brother, who wants the money.
   Hoffman, known as a hard-working perfectionist on a movie set,
says Cruise is equally driven.
   ``He's a demon. He gets up early, he works out, he goes home
early, he studies, he works out again at night. ... And he always
wanted to rehearse,'' Hoffman said in December's Gentlemen's
Quarterly.

   A judge dismissed Jackie Mason's libel suit
against a Florida woman who filed a paternity suit against the
comedian.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan threw out Mason's lawsuit Monday
for lack of personal jurisdiction.
   Mason last year sued Ginger Reiter and her mother, Miriam Oliver,
alleging libel, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement and
unjust enrichment, over a live stage production ``Oh Jackie Oh,'' on
which they collaborated.
   Ms. Reiter's paternity lawsuit in Florida is pending.
   Mason's attorney, Jay D. Kramer, declined comment on Monday's
ruling, saying he had not yet seen it.
   There was no answer at the Port Washington offices of Ms.
Reiter's lawyers when called for comment Monday evening.

   Tahnee Welch says it was difficult growing up as
the child of a sex symbol, but she doesn't fault her mother, Raquel.
   ``She's a hard worker. She's always taken care of herself. My
mother has never, never, never been supported by anyone,'' the
26-year-old Welch said. ``So I had it in my mind that I had to do it
myself. I have this pride.''
   The younger Welch insists she won her part in the 1985 film,
``Cocoon,'' on merit, not because of her mother. Welch also appears
in the recently released ``Cocoon: The Return.''
   ``They said I never paid my dues,'' Welch said in an interview in
December's Gentlemen's Quarterly. ``It's like what I was doing
didn't count. Like I cheated. But the point is not the advantages I
had but what I'm doing with them.''

   The Duke and Duchess of York picked the historic
Chapel Royal in London's St. James Palace for the Dec. 20
christening of their infant daughter, Princess Beatrice.
   The chapel was the site of the wedding of Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert in 1840 and where royal christenings occasionally have
taken place.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, will wear the royal
family's christening robe of Honiton lace and will be baptized at
the silver gilt Lily Font, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   Princess Beatrice, born Aug. 8, is the first child of Prince
Andrew, the queen's second son, and the former Sarah Ferguson.
   The royal couple chose John Habgood, the archbishop of York and
second-ranking prelate in the Church of England, to christen their
daughter.

   Doubleday has acquired the English publishing
rights to 14 books by Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian writer who won
the 1988 Nobel Prize in literature, and to a book on architecture by
Britain's Prince Charles.
   Jacqueline Onassis, a Doubleday editor, and Alberto Vitale,
president and chief executive officer of the Bantam Doubleday Dell
Publishing Group, who lived in Egypt for many years, acquired the
rights to Mahfouz's works from The American University in Cairo
Press, the publishing house said.
   It was not immediately known how much Doubleday paid to acquire
the English rights to the works by Mahfouz and Prince Charles. The
publishing house could not be reached after office hours Monday for
comment.
   Doubleday said last week that the company will publish 14 books
by the 77-year-old Mahfouz, the first writer in the Arabic language
to win the Nobel Prize in literature.
   It will publish a collection of his short stories and 13 of his
novels, four of which have never been published in English.
   Charles' book, ``A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of
Architecture,'' is based on his recent television documentary, which
sharply criticized modern architecture in Britain. The British
publishing rights were acquired by Doubleday U.K., a division of
Transworld Publishers Ltd. London.

   Callers from around the country have
offered money, stuffed animals and other help for three young
children who survived a car-train crash that killed their parents
and three siblings, officials said.
   Two funds also were opened for 6-year-old Wayne Nelson, his
brother Daniel, 4, and sister Melinda Jo, 5.
   Their parents, Arlynn, 41, and Theresa Nelson, 29, died last week
when a freight train smashed into their car at a fog-covered
railroad crossing five miles west of Valley City. Also killed were
the children's brother Michael, 9, and two sisters, 15-month-old
Michelle and 6-week-old Kelley.
   ``I have gotten calls from all over the country,'' said Gail
Pederson, a nursing supervisor at Mercy Hospital in Valley City,
where Wayne and Daniel remained hospitalized Monday in good
condition.
   Melinda Jo remained in critical condition Monday in St. Luke's
Hospitals in Fargo. Family members said she has had at least three
operations for severe head injuries and has a badly broken arm.
   In addition to the telephone inquiries, the two funds started for
the children have raised about $900.
   Mercy Hospital employees contributed about $200 to buy U.S.
savings bonds for the children, said Joan Stoltz, a hospital
supervisor. Another $700 has come into a separate trust at First
National Bank in Valley City, spokesman Doug Anderson said.
   The Nelson boys' hospital room also is filled with gifts, Stoltz
said.
   ``They have seven or eight stuffed animals apiece, balloons and
toys ... lots of toys,'' she said. ``About the only thing they're
running out of is batteries.''
   The two boys were released from the hospital briefly Saturday for
the family's funeral in Valley City, authorities said.
   The boys remain hospitalized only because arrangements about who
they will live with have not been decided, Barb Roeber, patient
services director, said Monday.
   The children's maternal grandmother, Anna Kunze of Valley City,
is their guardian and has been making medical decisions for them.

<HEAD>Japanese Department Store Buys Picasso's `Acrobat And Young
Harlequin'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Japanese department store said today that it
bought Pablo Picasso's ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' for a record
$38.46 million and plans to sell the Rose Period masterpiece to a
buyer in Tokyo.
   The pink-and-rose painting of two circus performers sold Monday
for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work of art created
in this century.
   It also was the third most expensive work of art ever auctioned.
It is surpassed only by two late 19th century paintings by Vincent
van Gogh sold in 1987, ``Irises'' at $53.9 million and
``Sunflowers'' at $41.3 million.
   Yasuhiro Tanaka, a spokesman for Mitsukoshi Department Store,
said in Tokyo that its representative Akio Nishino bought the
Picasso painting at the Christie's auction in London on behalf of
the store.
   ``We bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer
here in Tokyo,'' Tanaka said.
   But he said the store, which is a major importer of art into
Japan, had not decided on specific plans for displaying or selling
the painting.
   Nishino left the crowded saleroom after buying the painting and
slumped in a chair in a private room for 20 minutes.
   He didn't speak to reporters but wore a big smile. A director
said the man was emotionally exhausted.
   ``We offered him a glass of champagne but he didn't like it and
had Coca-Cola instead,'' said Mark Wrey, spokesman for the auction
house.
   ``The buyer told me he had bought a most wonderful masterpiece.
He didn't question the price _ he was very excited.''
   Japan's imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years
as increasingly affluent Japanese turn to collecting as a form of
investment.
   Japan's Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. bought Van Gogh's
``Sunflowers'' when it was sold at Christie's in London in March
1987. Dealers estimate that at least 30 percent of worldwide art
sales are to Japanese buyers, often large corporations that buy for
tax-free investment purposes.
   Picasso painted ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' in 1905 in his
Paris attic studio at 13 rue Ravignon using gouache, an opaque
watercolor easier to handle than oil paint.
   After being shown in Paris in 1905, it found its way into a
German museum and was confiscated by the Nazis in 1937 as an example
of decadent art. They sold it at auction in Switzerland to a Belgian
collector, and it had been in private hands since.
   Bidding on Monday opened at $9.2 million, and the painting sold
in 3{ minutes.
   The selling price topped the previous record for a 20th century
painting, $24.75 million paid for Picasso's ``Maternity'' Nov. 14 in
New York.
   Auctioneer Charles Allsopp said the price was not exorbitant.
   ``By any standard, Picasso was the towering figure of art in this
century. This picture was from his Rose Period, which is usually
considered his best, and it's the last great work of that series
likely to come on the market,'' Allsopp said.
   ``In the 27 years I've been here, it has gripped more people and
people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture.
It has had practically no detractors _ even among those who don't
like Picasso.''
   A picture by the French Impressionist Claude Monet, ``The
Railroad Bridge at Argenteuil,'' sold for $12.55 million, also
joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at
auction.
   In June 28, another Monet painting, ``In the Field,'' sold at
Sotheby's in London for $24.90 million.
   Monday's auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought $102.01
million, a record for an Impressionist and modern art sale in
London. Individual records were set for works by Picasso, Paul
Gauguin, Alberto Giacometti, Paul Klee and Paul Signac.

<TEXT>
   Twenty peasants and a civilian
liaison officer were tortured and burned before they were strangled
by leftist guerrillas last week, an army spokesman said.
   The guerrillas' coalition denied that rebels were responsible and
blamed the army for the massacre.
   The victims, found Saturday night in common graves near
Chimaltenango, about 50 miles west of Guatemala City, were tortured
before they were killed, army spokesman Col. Luis Arturo Isaacs
Rodriguez said on Monday.
   He denied a report that the victims were members of a death squad
and repeated government claims that guerrillas were responsible.
   The government said on Sunday that guerrillas killed Carlos
Humberto Guerra Callejas, a civilian who worked with the military in
El Aguacate town and who disappeared last Wednesday. It said the
guerrillas then massacred 20 friends and relatives who organized a
search party Friday and went looking for him.
   In a statement distributed in Mexico City, the National
Revolutionary Union of Guatemala, a guerrilla umbrella organization,
called the government charges ``totally and absolutely false'' and
said the army was trying to cover up involvement in the killings.
   Troops found the bodies, the government said. One officer was
reported wounded in a skirmish with rebels before the bodies were
discovered.
   The army and government blamed the killings on guerrillas of the
Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms, which, with the
Rebel Armed Forces and the Guerrilla Army of the Poor, form the
coalition battling the U.S.-backed government.
   Isaacs Rodriguez said the victims ``didn't have bullet wounds ...
but suffered torture and finally were strangled to death. Some had
burns on the hands and (their bodies) were partially burned.''
   He said the remains were taken Monday to the Chimaltenango army
base for identification and would be turned over to family members.
   The victims included at least 12 relatives of Guerra Callejas,
the government said.
   Guerra Callejas and other civilians contracted by the military
often wield considerable power in rural Guatemalan communities. Some
have been accused of involvement in human rights abuses.
   The 20 peasants killed lived in the hamlet of San Andres Iztapa.
Mayor Jose Luis Nunez Garcia on Monday declared a three-day period
of mourning.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas said they
killed or wounded 266 government soldiers during a week of fighting
and said they were increasing their attacks in the capital.
   The casualty claim was broadcast Monday on the rebels'
clandestine Radio Venceremos. The broadcast provided no other
details on government casualties and did not report rebel losses for
the period Nov. 20-26.
   Radio Venceremos is run by the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, the umbrella coalition of five rebel groups
fighting the U.S.-backed government for the past nine years.
   The Armed Forces Press Office on Monday said eight rebels were
killed and 30 more wounded in clashes with government troops Nov.
18-25. It did not report government casualties.
   Rebels also claimed responsibility for the assassination last
week of the mayor of Sesori, about 95 miles northeast of San
Salvador. Monday's broadcast accused Mayor Napoleon Villafuerte of
collaborating with an army counterinsurgency battalion operating in
the area.
   The army had said Villafuerte, of the right-wing Nationalist
Republican Alliance, was kidnapped on Wednesday. His body was found
Saturday outside Sesori.
   Monday's rebel broadcast said urban guerrillas were stepping up
their operations in San Salvador, the capital.
   ``The war is increasing on the outskirts of the capital where
permanent guerrilla forces and units operate constantly,'' it said.
   Urban guerrillas on Friday boarded a San Salvador city bus and
shot to death two soldiers and wounded a third, officials said. One
passenger was killed and three were seriously injured in a firefight
between the rebels and soldiers aboard the bus, a hospital spokesman
said.
   On Wednesday, urban guerrillas killed a soldier on a bus and
wounded another in a similar attack.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher; Stocks Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, and share prices sharply rebounded on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 122.15 yen, up 0.15 yen from Monday's close
of 122.00 yen. Opening higher at 122.50 yen, the currency fell
slowly but steadily while ranging between 122.00 yen and 122.51 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 380.27-point
loser the previous day, regained 334.98 points or 1.2 percent to
move back to 29,318.30. The index gained 79.53 points shortly after
the market opened and rose markedly during the afternoon session.
   The dollar's rise in Tokyo followed an advance in New York that
dealers attributed to the increase in the U.S. prime interest rate
and to an agreement by members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to reduce crude production.
   Major U.S. banks boosted their prime lending rates by a half
percentage point to 10.5 percent, the fourth increase this year.
Higher U.S. interest rates increase the attractiveness of
dollar-denominated investments.
   OPEC agreed Monday to set a daily production quota of 18.5
million barrels, down from its estimated 22.5 million-barrel current
production, and a target price of $18 a barrel. The announcement
triggered $1 a barrel increases in oil markets.
   Oil generally is priced in dollars, and higher OPEC prices raise
demand for dollars to pay for the oil.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa called the effect of the OPEC
agreement on exchange rates mostly psychological, and said the pact
would not have an immediate effect on the world economy.
   An exchange dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said he did not expect
any heavy dollar-selling in the market before the release of U.S.
unemployment figures, due out Friday in Washington.
   ``The market bearishness toward the dollar remains, but dealers
were reluctant to sell further until they see the figures,'' he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Nikkei Stock Average finished the morning session at
29,051.30, up 67.98 points from Monday's close. On Monday, the index
fell 380.27 points to close below the 29,000-point mark for the
first time since Nov. 16.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, many institutional investors stayed
on the sidelines watching movements in overseas markets ahead of the
upcoming release of U.S. gross national product and unemployment
figures, dealers said.
   Estimated U.S. GNP statistics for the July-September quarter were
scheduled for release later Tuesday in Washington.

<HEAD>Puget Sound `Spreads'; Some Worry About Dilution Of Identity</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY9</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Puget, circa 1792, would be proud. The
meager waterway bearing his name has grown to encompass much of
western Washington's inland sea lanes, but critics say the expansion
dilutes the Sound's identity.
   Some would stretch the edge of Puget Sound even farther _ to
Canada's door _ but a Northwest guide and amateur historian says
Puget Sound has gone far enough.
   Harvey Manning, author of guides to the trails of western
Washington, would put the cutoff point near the north end of the
Kitsap Peninsula, across from the southern tip of Whidbey Island. To
make his point, he would draw the line at Point No Point, 20 miles
north of Seattle.
   ``It dilutes the identity of Puget Sound to spread it over too
much water, and it lessens the identity of the other waterways,''
Manning said.
   Capt. Don Schwartzman, chairman of the state Pilotage Commission
and a 25-year veteran of the state ferry system, agreed with that
assessment.
   Any chart clearly shows that cutoff mark is the place where
Admiralty Inlet links the Strait of Juan de Fuca with Puget Sound,
he said.
   However, the borders ordered by the U.S. Board of Geographic
Names don't quite comply with that description. And those with
commerce in mind have much more divergent views.
   ``We figure ourselves as being on the north end of Puget Sound,''
said Gary Smith, manager of the Chamber of Commerce in Anacortes, 40
miles north of Point No Point.
   Puget Sound ``includes us,'' said Mike Brennan, executive vice
president of the Bellingham Chamber of Commerce, 20 miles north of
Anacortes.
   Smith said being part of Puget Sound, even when one is not, helps
promote the area to outsiders.
   ``It gives an association with the larger metropolitan area of
Seattle,'' he said. ``For the most part, we promote this area as
being part of the San Juan Islands, but when people ask us where's
that, we say in Puget Sound, north of Seattle.''
   That disregards such waters as Rosario Strait, Saratoga Passage,
the Strait of Georgia, and the bays of Skagit, Bellingham and
Padilla, said Manning.
   Those who extend Puget Sound past certain borders to include
``everything wet except martinis and rain'' are wrong, he said. The
real names will die as newcomers are fed the ``Puget Sound'' pablum,
he said.
   ``They don't have the right to make such a radical change,'' he
said.
   Capt. George Vancouver, the British explorer, first used the name
after he sailed into the region's inland waters in 1792. He named
the southern waters of what is now Puget Sound after one of his ship
captains, Peter Puget. The name applied only to meandering inlets
south of what is now Tacoma.
   The main channel north of the Tacoma Narrows to the Strait of
Juan de Fuca, named by earlier Spanish explorers, was named
Admiralty Inlet.
   In 1869, Congress changed the description of Puget Sound to a
general ``all the waters connected with the Strait of Juan de Fuca
within the territory of the United States.''

<HEAD>Harvard Professor Resigns After Plagiarism Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's top psychiatrists resigned from
Harvard Medical School's faculty after a student at another school
recognized plagiarized passages in the professor's writings dating
back 22 years.
   Dr. Shervert Frazier, 67, former director of the National
Institute of Mental Health, resigned last week as a Harvard
professor and head of McLean Hospital, a psychiatric hospital
affiliated with the university.
   Frazier did not dispute the findings of a faculty committee that
investigated the allegations, but said the plagiarism was
inadvertent, according to Dr. S. James Adelstein, dean of academic
programs at the medical school.
   ``He has accepted the evidence of the committee,'' Adelstein
said. ``But he has ascribed the events to his method of note-taking
and composing papers.''
   Harvard officials said Monday the plagiarism was spotted by Paul
Scatena, a graduate student in cognitive sciences at the University
of Rochester.
   Scatena said in a telephone interview he read several of
Frazier's papers while researching phantom pain, a burning sensation
that patients sometimes feel from a limb that has been amputated.
   Scatena said he found many incorrect citations in the papers and
recognized paragraphs that had been lifted from articles by other
researchers. He said he sent the passages to Dr. Daniel C. Tosteson,
dean of the Harvard Medical School, in August.
   Tosteson announced Frazier's resignation in a Nov. 23 letter to
the faculty. The letter, made public by the university Monday, says
a faculty committee investigated the allegations and concluded that
plagiarism occurred in four papers written by Frazier between 1966
and 1975.
   Frazier could not be reached for comment Monday. Spokesmen at
Harvard and McLean Hospital said he was out of town and unreachable.
He did not return messages left at the hospital, and the phone at
his home went unanswered.
   Three of the discredited papers are about phantom pain. The
fourth is on ``psychiatric emergency management.''
   The papers, which were published in medical journals and
textbooks, were intended as ``teaching instruments'' and did not
purport to present new research data, Adelstein said.
   One of Frazier's colleagues said he thought the forced
resignation was an overreaction.
   ``It's not as if he stole a great idea from someone or published
someone else's research as if it was his own,'' said Dr. Seymour
Kety, professor emeritus of psychiatry and senior scientist at the
National Institute of Health.
   But Dr. Miles Shore, director of the Massachusetts Mental Health
Center, said: ``Academic institutions have a very important
obligation to guarantee the scientific integrity of what goes on
within their walls and I think Harvard took the appropriate action.''
   And Harvard spokesman Peter Costa said: ``The university takes
very seriously any charges of plagiarism because that's what we're
about _ the search for truth and knowledge.''
   The university has been hit by other allegations of scientific
misconduct in recent years. In 1981, John R. Darsee was stripped of
his position as a heart researcher for allegedly falsifying data.
This year, Scheffer C.G. Tseng left his post at Massachusetts Eye
and Ear Infirmary after he was accused of changing his test methods
and violating Harvard's conflict-of-interest rules in promoting an
experimental eye drug.
   Also this year, Harvard Medical School issued new guidelines for
researchers in an effort to prevent academic fraud. The school also
said it would consider appointing professors on the basis of only
five to 10 papers, a move aimed at reducing the ``publish or
perish'' pressure that sometimes underlies fraud.
   Frazier was a professor of psychiatry at Harvard from 1972 until
1984, when he left to become director of the National Institute of
Mental Health in Rockville, Md. He returned to Harvard in 1986 to
become head of McLean, one of the nation's leading psychiatric
hospitals.
   He has worked at the Mayo Clinic, Presbyterian Hospital in New
York and Baylor University, among other institutions. He is a former
commissioner of mental health and mental retardation in Texas.

<TEXT>
   The attorney for a pathologist
accused of murder in the mercy killing his cancer-stricken wife
rested his case without presenting any testimony, saying the state's
evidence was weak.
   ``Surprise, your honor, the defense rests,'' Stanley Rosenblatt,
attorney for Dr. Peter Rosier, said after a lunch break Monday.
   ``I don't think they came close to proving any crime.''
   Lee County Circuit Judge James Thompson, who rejected defense
requests for acquittal and a mistrial declaration, scheduled closing
arguments for Wednesday. He said he would meet with attorneys today
to prepare jury instructions.
   Rosier, 47, is charged with first-degree murder, attempted
first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the death of
his terminally ill wife, Patricia, nearly three years ago.
   During the Thanksgiving weekend, Rosenblatt discussed strategy
with his client. He said he considered putting the Rosiers' two
children, Jacob, 19, and Elizabeth, 22, on the stand as character
witnesses. The decision to rest without calling a witness was not
made until Monday, the attorney said.
   The decision means Rosenblatt will have the final say to the jury
in rebuttal remarks.
   The prosecution contended Mrs. Rosier failed in a suicide attempt
by taking 20 Seconal sedatives.
   Rosier, a retired Fort Meyers pathologist, then bungled an
attempt to kill his wife with morphine injections and suppositories,
so Mrs. Rosier's stepfather, Vincent Delman, smothered her to end
her suffering, Assistant State Attorney Ed Volz contended.
   The doctor hoped to profit from his wife's painful death through
his unpublished book, which he wanted to turn into a screenplay,
Volz maintained.
   Mrs. Rosier wanted to commit suicide to avoid a horrible death
from cancer that had spread from her lungs to other organs, said
Rosenblatt.
   Rosier acted out of compassion and did nothing that could have
killed his wife of 23 years, Rosenblatt said.
   Mrs. Rosier, 43, died Jan. 15, 1986. Her lagging health and death
were chronicled by a Fort Myers television station. Broadcasts
quoting Rosier as saying he played a role in her death prompted the
murder investigation.
   Before prosecutors knew of Delman's role, he was given immunity
in return for his testimony.

   Theodore Morrison, a poet and novelist who
taught creative writing at Harvard College for more than four
decades, has died. He was 87.
   Morrison, an Amherst resident, died Sunday at Cooley Dickenson
Hospital in Northampton.
   Morrison taught at Harvard from 1930 to 1973, and was director of
the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference at Middlebury College from 1932
through 1955.
   He wrote four novels, published four books of poetry and also
wrote, ``The Portable Chaucer,'' a modernization of the principal
works of the Middle English poet.
   Morrison was born in Concord, N.H., graduated from Lynn (Mass.)
Classical High School and from Harvard, magne cum laude, in 1923.
During World War II, he was consultant for speech, American history
and composition for special Army Air Corps programs.
   Morrison and his wife, Florence Kathleen, were close friends of
poet Robert Frost and served as initial custodians of his Homer
Noble Farm in Ripton, Vt., when Middlebury purchased the 150-acre
property in 1966.
   Besides his wife, survivors include a daughter.
   A memorial service is scheduled for Saturday at Grace Episcopal
Church.

   More than 850 people were arrested in unrest
between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis, and portraits of Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini have appeared on the streets of
the Azerbaijani capital, Soviet media reported.
   The government newspaper Izvestia printed an interview with
26-year-old Nemat Panakhov, said to have led rallies by thousands of
protesters on Baku's Lenin Square.
   Izvestia correspondents asked him to explain why ``we saw green
flags and portraits of Khomeini on the square.'' It quoted Panakhov
as saying leaders of the protests rejected such appeals to Moslem
fundamentalism.
   Azerbaijanis are predominantly Moslem, and their neighbors the
Armenians are predominantly Christian. Both republics border on
Iran, and the Soviet Union is concerned about the possibility of
Khomeini's fundamentalist Moslem revolution in Iran spreading across
the frontier to Soviet Central Asia.
   No new outbreaks of violence were reported in the troubled
southern republics, where at least seven people, including four
soldiers, were killed in ethnic violence last week.
   A strict curfew remained in effect several cities, including Baku
and the Armenian capital, Yerevan. Soldiers and tanks patrolled the
streets.
   The Soviet TV news program ``Vremya'' said most factories in
Yerevan were closed Monday and the situation in Baku remained
``complicated and strained.''
   Official Baku radio, in a report monitored in London, said 867
people were arrested in the Azerbaijani capital on Sunday night and
Monday morning, and that 18 of them were jailed.
   Quoting a report from the city's military commandant, it said,
``There were about 10,000 people on Lenin Square while the curfew is
in force, many citizens are staying away from their houses and these
people are violating the special situation.''
   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said in a telephone interview
that Khachik Stamultyan, a recently elected deputy to the Armenian
Supreme Soviet, was detained and later released for speaking to a
crowd on a Yerevan street.
   Stamultyan is a member of the committee pressing to have the
predominantly Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside
Azerbaijan, annexed to Armenia. Azerbaijan and national authorities
have rejected such a move.
   ``There is nothing new in the town (Yerevan),'' Popoyan said.
``Soldiers ask any group of more than three to disperse, even knots
of people at bus stops.''
   Officials and the state media have said three of the four dead
soldiers were killed in the first wave of violence last week in the
Azerbaijani cities of Nakhichevan and Kirovabad when Interior
Ministry troops stepped in to control rioting. The fourth death was
reported Sunday in the military newspaper Red Star, which said a
soldier was run over deliberately by a truck.
   The remaining three victims were Azerbaijanis, killed in
Kirovabad by soldiers for violating the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew,
according to a local Communist Party official.

<HEAD>Activist Urges Democracy, Political Freedom For China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese activist said in an essay published
today that foreign countries should invest in his country only on
condition the Communist government makes progress in human rights.
   Ren Wanding also criticized Beijing of depriving its citizens of
``basic rights of citizenship'' such as voting in meaningful
elections.
   His comments appeared in the English-language South China Morning
Post. The Hong Kong paper said the essay broke a 10-year silence by
the activist, who was jailed for four years after figuring
prominently in the Democracy Movement of 1978-79.
   Dissidents were allowed at the time to air their views by pasting
character posters on a small Beijing wall known as ``Democracy
Wall,'' but the government soon cracked down.
   Ren founded the Human Rights Alliance in 1978 and authored a
19-point Human Rights Declaration before he was taken into custody
in March 1979, the Post said.
   In the essay, translated from Chinese to English by the
newspaper, Ren recalled the movement he helped spearhead:
   ``The Democracy Wall dared to expose the problem of life-long
tenure in office, the fact that `ownership by the people' is state
ownership, the existence of unemployment and surplus labor, and many
other economic truths'' about China, he wrote.
   Since the Democracy Movement, China has opened to the outside
world and sought overseas investment in a bid for modernization. But
Ren urged foreign countries not to place more money in China until
certain changes occur.
   ``Industrially developed countries investing in China and
providing economic aid should take into consideration the reform of
China's social structure, the expansion of democratic institutions,
and the release of political prisoners,'' wrote Ren, a 44-year-old
electrician.
   ``Progress on these fronts should be a condition for investment.
Enhancing the power of an unreformed state suggests greater
suppression of the people, who will sooner or later react.''
   Ren frequently returned to the theme of democratic change, which
he said was essential to China.
   ``In 1949, the Communist Party came to power through force. Now
it should let the people decide their future through the ballot
box,'' Ren said. ``For the next few decades at least, China is
likely to be a confused and unstable place.''
   Such outspoken calls for democracy are rare in China.
Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi is the most prominent active dissident,
frequently criticizing the Communist government and questioning
Marxism.
   Wei Jingsheng, a former electrician at the Beijing Zoo, was the
leading dissident in the ``Democracy Wall'' era but has been in jail
since 1979, when he was sentenced on charges of supplying military
secrets to a foreign power and agitating to topple the Chinese
socialist system.

<HEAD>Report Suggests $400 Million For Antimatter Research And
Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $400 million investment could help
scientists harness antimatter, perhaps leading to faster spacecraft
and better ways to treat cancer and detect flaws in complex
machines, a Rand Corp. study says.
   ``We are on the threshold of important advances in the basic
science of antimatter and its practical applications. But as
tantalizingly near as that may be, the rewards cannot be realized
without a program such as we are advocating,'' said Bruno
Augenstein, a physicist at the think tank.
   The Rand report stems from a 1987 meeting of 80 experts on
antimatter. They detailed experiments needed if they are to harness
antimatter. Augenstein determined such research would cost about
$400 million over 10 years.
   Recognizing federal budget deficits, the Air Force-sponsored
report stopped short of urging the expenditure, although it said
such spending would be warranted.
   Rand said the government, universities and industry should spend
$30 million jointly over three years to modify an atom smasher to
produce one quadrillion antimatter particles annually and to develop
devices that can store the particles, called antiprotons, for
practical uses.
   ``Antimatter has a very buzzwordy, gosh-gee-willy impact upon the
general public. People immediately think of `Star Trek,''' but the
exotic substance really exists, said physicist Michael Nieto, of Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
   For each type of particle in matter, there is a corresponding
particle of antimatter that has the same mass but an opposite
electric charge. Protons are positively charged particles in atoms
of matter. Antiprotons are their negatively charged antimatter
counterparts.
   ``If you had a twin brother made out of antimatter, you would
literally annihilate each other in a big explosion of light and
energy if you came into contact,'' said Nieto, who co-edited a book
of technical papers from the 1987 conference.
   Such explosions could be harnessed as rocket fuel, although that
would be the most difficult practical application to develop,
Augenstein and Nieto said.
   Antimatter is a promising rocket fuel because a tiny amount can
produce as much energy as a huge tank of chemical rocket fuel, ``so
you only have to carry a small amount of antimatter into orbit to
carry you to Mars,'' Nieto said.
   Antimatter-powered spacecraft would be lighter, faster and able
to carry heavier payloads farther than existing rockets, Augenstein
said.
   If the $400 million is spent, antiprotons could be available in a
decade for radiation therapy for cancer patients, he said. Unlike
existing methods, antiproton beams could be targeted so precisely
the particles would destroy only a tumor with minimal damage to
intervening tissue, Augenstein said.
   Compared with X-rays, CAT scans and magnetic resonance imaging,
antiprotons should produce more accurate, easier-to-interpret
pictures of the inside of the human body to help doctors diagnose
cancers and other diseases, Augenstein said. Nieto said antiprotons
also would expose patients to much less radiation.
   Pictures made using antiprotons instead of X-rays also should
make it 1,000 times faster to detect and weld cracks or other flaws
in industrial materials and machines such as airplane parts, rocket
nozzles and turbine blades, Augenstein said.
   Nieto said a reliable source of antiprotons also would help
physicists ``study the fundamental properties of matter and
antimatter, and the fundamental forces which act upon them.''
   The report said antiprotons could be mass-produced by modifying
an existing proton accelerator, either at Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory in Illinois, or at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long
Island, N.Y.
   Three existing atom smashers, or particle accelerators, now
create antiprotons, but each yields trillions of the particles each
year, far fewer than scientists need.
   Storing antimatter requires keeping it from contact with matter.
Augenstein said magnetic fields could be used to hold them in ``ion
traps'' or keep them circulating in storage rings.

   The National Organization for Women says the
Justice Department should use federal antitrust, racketeering and
civil rights laws to combat violence against abortion clinics.
   NOW President Molly Yard on Monday likened violent attacks on
abortion clinics to terrorism. Although the Reagan administration is
concerned enough with international terrorism to deny PLO leader
Yasser Arafat a visa to address the United Nations, it ``ignores the
terrorists already operating in this country,'' she said.
   Yard said at a news conference that the administration has made
little response to NOW's repeated requests for greater enforcement.
   The Justice Department, which refused comment, has prosecuted
some anti-abortion activists for civil rights violations in
connection with abortion clinic bombings.

<HEAD>Pentagon Plans Major Survey on Sexual Harassment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department will send questionnaires
next month to more than 34,000 men and women in the armed forces,
plus 4,000 in the Coast Guard, in one of the most extensive surveys
ever undertaken to spotlight sexual harassment in the workplace.
   The written survey will ask if they have ever been the victims of
``uninvited, unwanted sexual attention.''
   The Merit Systems Protection Board, which conducted a similar
survey among civilian government workers last year, polled a sample
of about 13,000 full-time federal workers and received responses
from 8,500.
   The military survey was ordered last February by Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in response to a recommendation from a
special task force. The panel concluded that sexual harassment was a
serious problem for women in the armed forces and that the services
should open additional jobs to females.

   Carl Furguson, 31, of Sloansville was charged with second-degree
murder in Sunday morning's death of John Effner, said state police
Trooper L.D. Teetz.
   Furguson shot the boy with a .22-caliber rifle through the window

about 30 miles west of Albany, said state police Investigator Joseph
Karas.
   Furguson had been visiting a relative of the victim's next-door

   Investigators speculated that Furguson did not think his rifle
was loaded.
   When Furguson saw the boy pointing a toy gun at him and making

aimed it at the boy without checking the chamber to see if there was
a bullet there and fired,'' Schoharie County District Attorney
Michael West said.
   The boy died at Albany Medical Center about four hours after the
shooting, police said.
   Furguson fled after seeing he had shot the boy, police said. He

<HEAD>Romanian Leader Backing Off Village Razing Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu of
Romania appears to have backed off from a controversial plan to raze
up to 7,000 villages, many of them home to ethnic Hungarians.
   Ceausescu, speaking Monday to the Communist Party Central
Committee in Bucharest, made no mention of criticism from the West
and from neighboring Hungary, which fears the plan will destroy the
cultural heritage of about 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania.
   The village plan, made public in April, called for the razing of
the villages and the resettlement of residents in new housing in
``agro-industrial centers.''
   Romanian officials said the plan was aimed at gaining more
farmland for use by state-owned collective farms.
   But some foreigners, including former U.S. ambassador to Romania
David Funderburk, said Ceausescu's motive was to wipe out evidence
of Romania's capitalist and religious past.
   ``By destroying much of what is creative and beautiful _ historic
churches, monuments and fortresses _ in Romania's past, Mr.
Ceausescu hopes to separate the people from their culture and
heritage,'' Funderburk wrote last month in the British magazine The
Economist.
   Ceausescu cited the need Monday to preserve unspecified communes,
or groups of villages, to prevent depopulation of the countryside.
   ``We have in mind the preservation of the number of communes and
in a few counties even the development of a few communal centers
which have been depopulated,'' Ceausescu was quoted as saying by the
official news agency Agerpres.
   He said many Romanians were migrating to towns to work in
factories, where they get higher salaries than in agriculture.
   ``That's why resolute measures are needed for preventing the
depopulation of rural settlements, for organizing them on a modern
basis and creating conditions likely to provide inhabitants with
everything they need for a decent, civilized life,'' Ceausescu said.
   Ceausescu's comments drew differing interpretations.
   ``It's clear that Ceausescu is backing off from his original
statements, not because of mounting international opposition but due
to lack of money and materials,'' said a former high-ranking
official in the Romanian party who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   According to a summary of the speech distributed by Agerpres,
Ceausescu departed from recent practice by not once mentioning the
controversial village scheme by name. Last spring, he said at least
half of Romania's 13,000 villages ``must disappear.''
   The Central Committee is holding its three-day meeting to review
Romania's long-term economic plans until the year 2000. Agerpres did
not say why the meeting, originally scheduled for September, was
delayed for two months.

   Syrian peacekeeping troops rounded up 50
gunmen today in pre-dawn house raids across west Beirut in what
their command said was an effort to prevent the rekindling of
fighting between Shiite Moslem militias.
   Police said most of the arrested gunmen of the pro-Syrian Amal,
Arabic for Hope, and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
were released after questioning. Arms caches of undisclosed amounts
also were seized.
   The two militias fought six days of street battles in west and
south Beirut in the latest round of their struggle for dominance of
Lebanon's Shiite Moslem community. At least 40 people were killed
and 87 wounded in the clashes.

<HEAD>Dorm Rules Slightly Relaxed, Still Ban Most Opposite Sex
Overnighters</HEAD>

   Boston University's slightly relaxed rules for
dormitory guests don't go far enough, said a student who helped
organize vigorous protests of a ban on overnight visitors of the
opposite sex.
   University President John Silber on Monday announced he had
accepted the recommendations of a task force that decided to allow
some overnight guests. The task force of parents, students, faculty
and school officials was commissioned after thousands of students
demonstrated against the ban.
   Silber limited overnight guests of the opposite sex to family
members. Visits between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. would have to be approved
in writing by all roommates 24 hours in advance.
   But students remain forbidden from being overnight hosts to
unrelated members of the opposite sex, and Kevin Carleton, a
spokesman for the 27,000-student private school, said the rules
changes probably won't go into effect until next fall.
   The recommendations don't make the rules palatable because they
don't substantially change the original decision, said Susheel
Srikonda, who, along with another student, formed a group called
Active, Concerned, Together (ACT) to fight the new policies.
   ACT wanted to take a different approach that would emphasize
roommate approval and give the resident assistants who are in charge
of dormitories a larger role, he said.
   ``They are not changed that much,'' said Srikonda, a 20-year-old
computer science major.
   Carleton disagreed.
   ``The initial policy that was proposed was that there be no
overnight guests,'' he said. ``The tone of it was to discourage
overnight guests. This is saying that there certainly can be
overnight guests. It describes the format in which that can occur.''
   The ban, announced in September, drew wide attention, including
that of television talk-show host Phil Donahue, who visited campus
to interview administration officials and student leaders.
   Silber said he approved the ban because parents ``are, in a
proportion of about 30 to 1, (were) opposed to overnight visitors of
the opposite sex.''
   He conceded the university, which has a dormitory population of
about 8,500, cannot police dormitories rigorously but said the
school is obliged to discourage certain behavior.

   Snow fell in the Northeast, Midwest and West today and high winds
whipped across southern California.
   Rain and snow showers that were scattered across the Northeast
formed ahead of a cold front entering the lower Great Lakes region
and northern New England.
   A snow advisory was posted for the mountains and northwestern
sections of Pennsylvania. The Laurel Mountains of Pennsylvania had
about 2 inches of snow by early today.
   Elswhere, a cold front caused snow and high winds in Colorado,
prompting advisories for snow and blowing snow in the northern and
central mountains of the state. Up to 8 inches of snow was expected.
   Snow showers were scattered from the central High Plains across
the middle Missouri Valley.
   Santa Ana winds up to 60 mph led to a high wind warning in
southern California.
   Much of the Northwest was cloudy, and light rain was scattered
along the coast.
   Clear skies prevailed from California through the southern Plains
to the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Today's forecast called for snow scattered from the upper Great
Lakes into the lower Missouri Valley and over northern Maine; and
rainshowers over northwest Washington state.
   Highs should be in the 20s from the upper Mississippi Valley into
upper Michigan; 50s and 60s from the central California Coast across
the southern Rockies, west central and northern Texas, Arkansas and
the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast; 70s
over southern California, southwest Arizona, south central Texas and
southern Florida; and 30s to 40s across most of the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees at Hibbing, Minn., to 70 at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>China Claims Artifact At Sotheby's Auction Was Stolen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sotheby's withdrew an ancient bronze vessel from
a sale of Chinese artifacts scheduled for today after the Chinese
government said the item had been stolen in June from a Chinese
museum.
   The item was withdrawn from the auction of ``Fine Chinese
Ceramics and Works of Arts'' at least two weeks ago after Sotheby's
received a description of the missing museum piece from a
representative of the Chinese government, said a Sotheby's
spokesman, Matthew Weigman.
   He said Sotheby's was holding the ritual vessel, called a dui,
pending a resolution of the dispute between the owner and China.
   According to the official Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, China's
Interpol office notified its U.S. counterpart Saturday of the theft,
and Chinese police met Monday with a U.S. Embassy official to ask
Washington's help in recovering the object.
   The Chinese government report said Chinese police identified the
dui from a color photograph in a Sotheby's catalog, which did not
identify the owner and said it was expected to sell for $60,000 to
$80,000.
   The vessel was made during China's Warring States Period, from
475 B.C. to 221 B.C., a period of conflict among rival princes
before what is now northern China was unified under the first
emperor.
   Chinese police say the dui in the catalog is identical in shape,
decoration and patina spots to one that was stolen June 4 from the
Qu Yuan Museum in Zigui County in central China's Hubei province.
The thieves remain at large.
   The dui was excavated in the county in 1983.
   An expert at Beijing's Palace Museum said craftsmen at the time
the piece was made were unable to cast identical bronze pieces.
   Millions of dollars worth of artifacts are smuggled out of China
each year, most through Hong Kong. Some are stolen from museums, but
most are discovered by peasants in their fields or by tomb robbers,
and the sites are wrecked before archaeologists can study them.
   Weigman said an auction ``would actually be the worst possible
place'' to dispose of a stolen object because the process _ which
includes the publication of photographs and detailed descriptions of
every item _ is so public.
   In April, Sotheby's withdrew a bronze statue of a Roman god from
auction after experts determined that the statue belonged to the
Musee des Beaux Arts et d'Archeologie in Besancon, France. The
statue, worth $5,000, had been stolen in 1914, and was being sold
through the New York auction house by the St. Louis Art Museum. The
St. Louis museum acquired it in 1953 from a donor who apparently did
not know it had been stolen.
   Two scholars who saw the statue in a Sotheby's catalog questioned
its authenticity, speculating it might be a copy of the missing
bronze. Experts determined that, in fact, it was the missing bronze.

   Soviet human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov has extended his first visit to the West and is resting at
the home of his wife's children.
   The 67-year-old Nobel Prize-winning physicist, who arrived in the
United States on Nov. 4, originally was scheduled to return to
Moscow on Nov. 18.
   But after visiting New York and Washington, where he met
President Reagan, Sakharov spent Thanksgiving at the suburban Boston
home of Efrem and Tatiana Yankelevich, the daughter and son-in-law
of his wife, Yelena Bonner.
   The Yankeleviches, who moved to the United States more than a
decade ago, have zealously guarded Sakharov's privacy, screening all
calls, invitations and media inquiries.
   Tatiana Yankelevich said Monday the date of Sakharov's return was
uncertain. She said he was resting and working, but declined to say
what he was working on.
   Sakharov's wife remained in the Soviet Union.
   Sakharov has been an outspoken advocate for political prisoners
in the Soviet Union and has warned that there is a dangerous
domestic backlash to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms.

<HEAD>Drell Quits As Co-Director of Stanford Arms Control Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top arms control expert has resigned as
co-director of the Stanford University's Center for International
Security and Arms Control because of the procedure used to appoint
the center's faculty.
   Physicist Sidney Drell complained Monday that he was ``stymied''
in efforts to build a multidisciplinary faculty because university
rules say center appointments must come through existing departments
such as history or science.
   The center's students and scholars come from a wide variety of
departments and one-fourth of the university's graduating seniors
now earn degrees in such programs as human biology, international
relations and public policy.
   Drell said appointments of some of the center's best students to
professorial positions have been blocked because of university rules.
   The center recently was cited by an independent,
foundation-sponsored evaluation as the premier trainer of students
and scholars in arms control, sharing honors with the Massachusettes
Institute of Technology for its research work.
   Drell's resignation is effective next Aug. 31. He will return to
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center as deputy director.
   ``With my departure, several of my outstanding younger
colleagues, who have helped me build a strong research and training
program in technical issues of security and arms control, are now
planning to leave,'' Drell said.
   ``I hope that this loss is only temporary and that before too
long new means can be designed within the university structure to
rebuild this part of the program.''
   University officials conceded the appointment procedure is a
problem.
   ``His evident disappointment with the administration's response
to his request points up a difficult problem for us, and the provost
and I will continue to wrestle with it in consultation with the
faculty,'' said Stanford President Donald Kennedy.
   Earlier this year, the faculty senate created an ad hoc committee
to study the entire appointment process. Drell said he was sure the
issue would be discussed by the committee.
   Drell is a close friend of Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov and
has been a government advisor on arms control for more than 20
years. He's played a fundamental role in the direction of Star Wars
research, advocating continued study but criticizing some aspects of
the program.

<HEAD>Rabin Urges Labor To Join Likud-led Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin urged his Labor
Party today to consider joining a coalition government led by the
rival Likud bloc to keep out smaller parties whose demands for
religious legislation has angered American Jews.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Likud has offered Labor two
senior Cabinet ministries if the left-leaning party joins a
broad-based government.
   Labor leaders are meeting Wednesday to consider the offer, and
some party officials predicted a showdown between Laborites willing
to compromise and those who want to sit in Parliament as an
opposition party.
   ``The public is worried about the country and not about settling
small scores,'' Rabin said today on army radio. ``The reality we are
facing requires the party to seriously examine the possibilities of
establishing a broad-based government.''
   Likud has offered Labor the Defense Ministry, meaning Rabin would
be able to keep his job if Labor joins the government.
   ``In the first stage after the elections, the two large parties
pursued the religious parties in an exaggerated way, and I was a
partner to that,'' Rabin said, referring to the parties' offers to
pass religious legislation.
   ``It is clear to us now that this included promises to change
things that could create a rift between Israel and the Jewish
nation. ... It seems to me if there is a possibility to prevent
this, it will be by establishing a joint government,'' Rabin said.
   Likud won 40 parliamentary seats to Labor's 39 in Nov. 1
elections for the 120-member Knesset. It was chosen to form the
government because of its alliances with small right-wing and
ultra-Orthodox religious parties.
   But the religious parties' squabbles over Cabinet posts and their
demand for controversial legislation have entangled Likud's effort.
   The religious parties want a law that would accept only
conversions to Judaiam performed by Orthodox rabbis, angering
American Jews who mostly belong to the Reform or Conservative
movements.
   Among the stumbling blocks to Labor-Likud negotiations to form a
government are whether Likud will offer its left-wing rival an equal
number of ministries and what job Labor leader Shimon Peres will get.
   Peres is now foreign minister, but his party and Likud have sharp
differences over foreign policy that became stronger in the election
campaign.
   Peres pressed in the campaign for giving up occupied land in
exchange for peace and opening negotiations with the Palestinians
through an international peace conference.
   Shamir refuses to give up any of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
offers to negotiate only a limited autonomy for Palestinians, with
the final status of the occupied lands to be worked out later.
   Uzi Baram, Labor's general-secretary, predicted a tough fight
within the party over whether to join a Likud-led government.
   ``I am against negotiating with the Likud, and I will express
this in the Labor meeting. I believe there will be stubborn
resistance in the party's central committee,'' he said.
   If Labor joins a broad-based government under Likud, it would be
similar to the Cabinet that has ruled since 1984 elections gave
neither Labor nor Likud enough seats to form a government without
the other.
   In the new government, however, Shamir would likely be prime
minister for the entire four-year term. Under the power-sharing
agreement reached after the 1984 vote, Shamir and Peres each held
the top post for two year.

   Doctors treating surrealist painter
Salvador Dali today said his condition improved slightly overnight,
although it remained extremely critical.
   The 84-year-old artist is suffering from severe heart trouble
aggravated by blood clots in the lungs, government spokeswoman Rosa
Conde said.
   After a brief visit to Quiron Clinic to see Dali, Ms. Conde told
reporters Dali's doctors said ``he is better now than he was last
night. He has improved despite remaining in extremely critical
condition.''
   ``His doctors say he has serious respiratory problems complicated
by heart trouble,'' but doctors are encouraged by his strong ``will
to live,'' she said.
   She said Dali had asked for a television or a radio in his room
to permit him to listen to news coverage of his hospital stay.
   Dali, one of the founders of the Surrealist movement and one of
the best-known living artists in the world, is the last member of an
outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo
Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who died a decade later.
   Barcelona Mayor Pasqual Maragall visited Dali early today for 10
minutes and told Spanish National Radio that Dali ``is lucid and
responds quickly when spoken to with a very vital look.''
   ``He has difficulty breathing,'' the mayor said. ``His doctor
says he is very critical and that there is a 48-hour period of
caution to determine exactly the danger he faces.''
   News reports indicated Dali had suffered a cold for several days
last week. He developed pneumonia and heart trouble, causing his
medical team to rush him to a local hospital Sunday in his hometown
of Figueras.
   On Monday night, doctors ordered him transferred by ambulance
under police escort to the Quiron Clinic in Barcelona, 60 miles
south, where he was immediately placed in the intensive care unit
for treatment, his doctors said.
   Since August 1984 Dali has been in poor health as a result of
third-degree burns he suffered in an electrical fire that broke out
in the bedroom of his home in the village of La Pera, 40 miles south
of Figueras.
   The brush with death kept him bound to a wheelchair or in bed and
required that he be fed by tube. A team of nurses watched over him
around the clock since the fire.
   In July 1986 Dali received a heart pacemaker in surgery done in a
Barcelona hospital.
   Dali has lived in seclusion and suffered from frequent bouts of
depression since the death in 1982 of his wife, Gala, his principal
muse during a 50-year period of his career.

   Emperor Hirohito's temperature and other vital signs
soared today, 72 days after he fell ill with abdominal bleeding, the
Imperial Palace said.
   The emperor had a fever of 102 at dusk, well above his normal
95.9 and among the worst readings recorded since he first vomited
large amounts of blood on Sept. 19.
   Hirohito's breathing quickened and his pulse rose to 115 beats
per minute from recent levels of below 100, palace spokesman Kenji
Maeda said.
   Officials had no further comment on his condition except to say
chief physician Akira Takagi stayed beyond his normal hours tonight
at Hirohito's chambers in Fukiage Palace.
   Earlier today, Maeda said it was difficult to tell whether the
87-year-old monarch was asleep or awake. News reports say he is
losing consciousness and family members say he sleeps through their
visits.
   Doctors have transfused 45.4 pints of blood into him to combat
the bleeding and control his anemia. Hirohito has eaten almost
nothing in 72 days. There has been no official confirmation of
reports he had cancer.
   Hirohito ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne on Christmas Day 1926
and has reigned almost 62 years, longer than any of the world's
living monarchs. After Japan's defeat in World War II he became a
largely powerless symbol of the state.

   VaporSimac steam irons are being recalled
because of danger of starting fires, the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission announced today.
   About 10,000 VaporSimac irons have been sold nationwide by major
department stores and sewing specialty centers, the agency said. The
irons, which cost about $100 each, were sold between 1985 and 1987.
   The recall was initiated following seven reports of fire,
including one that caused a burn injury, the commission reported.
   The irons come with a separate, transparent plastic water
reservoir and are designed to operate both vertically and
horizontally, the agency said.
   Owners should immediately stop using the irons, and return them
to Electra Craft, 250 Halsey St., Newark, N.J., 07102, for a refund
including postage costs.
   Persons needing more information can contact Electra Craft at

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Orientation Day for the Senate's Class of '88</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the 10 men who will take their places
as freshman U.S. senators next year felt awed by a sense of history,
but others simply wanted to find their way from here to there.
   Monday was orientation day for the Senate class of 1988. And
while the five Democrats and five Republicans all talked of tackling
the federal government's massive deficit, their immediate concerns
were more mundane: staff and office space, telephones, security and
legislative procedure.
   Committee assignments were a pressing matter.
   There was much talk of exactly how low their place will be in the
pecking order of the Senate's seniority system.
   ``Everybody's worrying about numbers _ whether they'll be number
95, 96, 97, 98 or whatever,'' said Sen.-elect Conrad Burns, R-Mont.
``I said, `Boys, you can't get any lower than 100!'''
   That's Burns' number. One hundred _ and dead last in seniority.
   Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fla., figured he would be about 94th in
seniority when all was said and done.
   ``What does that get you?'' he was asked.
   ``Not very much, to tell you the truth,'' he replied.
   There are other numbers involved.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., an ardent amateur historian who keeps
track of such things, says that since the first Senate convened in
1789 there have been precisely 1,782 United States senators.
   When the 10 newcomers are sworn in with the convening of the
101st Congress in January, they will be numbered 1,783 to 1,792,
depending how on the final determination of their seniority is made
under the Senate's complicated rules and procedures for such things.
   But for now, some of the members of the class of '88 were fairly
glowing, even as they paid attention to what several called the
``nuts and bolts'' details of Senate life.
   ``It's a special day, a red letter day, a very personal day that
you'll never forget,'' said Sen.-elect Herb Kohl, D-Wis. ``But it's
also like going to college as a freshman.
   ``Think of it. Father and mother immigrants _ 65 years ago _ had
nothing. And now their son is a United States senator.''
   The son has a little more than nothing. A multimillionaire who
spent some $5 million on his election campaign, Kohl is owner of the
Milwaukee Bucks basketball team.
   Burns, a Montana farm broadcaster who upset Sen. John Melcher,
D-Mont., was asked to name the biggest challenge he faces as a new
senator.
   ``The biggest challenge to me is getting from here to there
without walking through all these cameras,'' he said, waving a hand
toward the forest of television cameras sprouting from the floor of
a Senate corridor.
   The new Democratic senators quickly found themselves the center
of attention from three Senate veterans _ Sens. Daniel K. Inouye,
D-Hawaii, Bennett Johnston, D-La., and George Mitchell, D-Maine. All
sought votes in their bids to succeed Byrd as Senate majority leader.
   Kohl said he would vote for Mitchell because ``he's a person I
feel comfortable with.''
   Joe Lieberman of Connecticut said he would make up his mind at
the last minute, adding that because he didn't know any of the three
candidates all that well, ``it comes down to a decision you make in
your gut.''
   Still, there was a sense of wonder at being in a position to make
such a choice at all.
   ``I feel a sense of history,'' said Lieberman. ``It's not going
to be an easy time to be a United States senator,'' he said, citing
budget deficits, taxes and environmental problems.
   Sen.-elect Charles Robb, a Democratic former governor of
Virginia, was told that the most frustrated senators are former
governors, shorn of the ability to make executive decisions on their
own authority.
   ``Thou sayest it,'' said Robb, who had little to say on any other
subject.
   Three members of the House _ Mack, Trent Lott, R-Miss., and James
Jeffords, R-Vt. _ are moving across the Capitol to the Senate.
   For Mack, being one of 100 senators is a lot better than being
one of 435 members of the House with its restrictive traffic-cop
rules.
   ``You have a much greater opportunity in the Senate to influence
legislation on the floor,'' Mack said.
   But for Lott, becoming a member of the Senate wasn't an automatic
step up. He gave up his No. 2 position in the House Republican
leadership to run for the seat being vacated by Sen. John Stennis,
D-Miss., a Senate veteran.
   ``You look at the House and the Senate and there certainly are a
lot of differences,'' Lott grumbled. ``Like why it takes three
months in the Senate to move in 10 guys when in the House they move
in 43 people in 30 days.''
   One new senator-to-be, Washington state Republican Slade Gorton,
was making his second debut as a freshman. He was defeated by
Democrat Brock Adams in 1986 but reinstated by the voters on Nov. 8.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., who has been in the Senate for eight
years, was asked if he had any advice for the newcomers.
   ``I'll tell them to pray a lot,'' he said, grinning.

<HEAD>Demjanjuk Attorney Dies In Plunge From Office Tower</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for convicted Nazi war criminal John
Demjanjuk died today after jumping from the 15th story of an office
tower in an apparent suicide, a police spokesman said.
   The death of 53-year-old Dov Eitan came less than a week before
Israel's Supreme Court was scheduled to hear Demjanjuk's appeal of
his conviction and death sentence for Nazi war crimes. The appeal
had been set to begin Monday.
   Eitan, a former district court judge who recently joined
Demjanjuk's defense team, died at 8:30 a.m. after hurling himself
from an upper floor of the City Towers office complex in downtown
Jerusalem, police spokesman Rafi Levy said.
   ``He jumped from the 15th floor,'' Levy said. ``There are no
other details.''
   Israel radio reported police found bits of polish from Eitan's
shoes on the sill of the window that he jumped from. It said the
window was in the lobby of the Ayalon Hotel, which is located on the
building's 15th floor.
   The radio said Eitan entered the hotel's empty lobby without the
receptionist noticing him.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk was convicted in April of being
``Ivan the Terrible,'' a brutal guard who operated gas chambers in
which 850,000 Jews died at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied
Poland.
   Demjanjuk, who lived in the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills
before being extradicted to Israel in 1986, claims he is an innocent
victim of mistaken identity.
   Eitan served for 17 years on the Jerusalem District Court bench
before retiring in 1983. His agreement in August to join the
Demjanjuk defense was widely viewed in Israel as adding prestige to
the team.
   He was to have argued Demjanjuk's appeal before a five-judge
panel along with another Israeli attorney, Yoram Sheftel, and a
Canadian attorney, Paul Chumak.
   A defense witness, Swedish-born Anita Pritchard, tried to commit
suicide by slitting her wrists and swallowing tranquilizers on Aug.
21, 1987 after her testimony was discredited.
   Eitan is survived by his wife, who lives in Jerusalem, and two
children.

   A Cabinet minister with the
power to close newspapers is demanding damage payments from a major
paper because it published an article poking fun at him and a
critical letter from a reader, the newspaper said today.
   Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha's action against The Star
follows similar demands last week directed at a black newspaper he
has already closed once, and at the editor of an anti-apartheid
newspaper now under suspension.
   Botha has the power under the 29-month state of emergency to
close newspapers without giving reasons. Three newspapers have been
closed temporarily by him this year.
   State-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest,
security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of
protest, and a range of statements the government considers
subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been
comprehensive.
   The Star said Botha, through the state attorney, was demanding
100,000 rand ($41,800) for defamation and impairment of his dignity.
   The newspaper said police are also investigating it for alleged
violations of laws dealing with the police and prisons, because of a
photograph and a guest editorial it published.
   On Friday, Botha demanded damage payments from New Nation, a
black newspaper published by the Southern African Catholic Bishops
Conference, for publishing excerpts of a speech by Anton Harber,
co-editor of The Weekly Mail. In the speech, Harber criticized
Botha's three-month banning of his newspaper and referred to the
Cabinet minister as narrow-minded.
   Botha is threatening to sue New Nation and Harber a total of
100,000 rand ($41,800) unless they pay him directly.
   The Weekly Mail is due to resume publishing Friday. New Nation
resumed publication June 30, after Botha banned it for three months.
   The government also has threatened action against a new
Afrikaans-language weekly, Vrye Weekblad, for allegedly promoting
the aims of outlawed organizations such as the African National
Congress.
   Botha's allegation that The Star defamed him is based in part on
a feature Nov. 13 in the paper's Sunday magazine. The article said,
``On the political gossip front, it's hard to beat the restaurant at
the Houses of Parliament. This star-studded setting inspires
comments like, `Stoffel Botha's the only man I know who walks
upright without a spine.'''
   The other item in The Star cited by Botha was a letter to the
editor from a reader, David Mumford, published on Nov. 14. The
letter described Botha as ``a greater danger to South Africa than
the ANC,'' and criticized the banning of The Weekly Mail.
   The Star said police were investigating the paper because of an
Aug. 23 article by a member of the Black Sash, a civil rights group,
criticizing pending legislation to increase evictions of black
squatters and because of the publication of a photograph of
imprisoned ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   It is illegal in South Africa to publish pictures of Mandela, but
a Star editor said the only picture of him the paper had published
was one taken from a government publication.
   The ANC is the chief guerrilla movement fighting to overthrow the
South African government and end apartheid.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of robbing a bank couldn't
resist the urge to do a little Christmas shopping, so he hired a
taxi outside the bank and rode from store to store for more than an
hour before he was arrested.
   By the time police caught up with Willie Carroll Williams, 37, of
Atlanta, on Monday, the cab was stuffed with shopping bags full of
shirts, shoes and pants, officers said.
   ``When you've got the money, you might as well spend it,'' the
cab driver, who asked not be identified, quoted his passenger as
saying.
   According to police, Williams phoned for the cab at about the
same time Coast Federal Savings and Loan was robbed. Authorities did
not release the dollar loss in the robbery, a policy followed with
federal banks, said Sarasota police Sgt. Michael Schott.
   After hopping into the cab outside the bank, Williams stopped at
the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport to buy plane tickets, and then
visited several shopping centers _ running up a cab fare of $26.70.
   ``I was cracking up most of the time I was in the cab with him,''
said the cab driver. ``He was having a good time.''
   Bank employees told police they thought the suspect fled in a
taxi.
   When detectives finally tracked down the vehicle, they were
surprised to learn that the suspect was still riding around
shopping, police spokesman Michael Schott said.
   Williams was charged with armed robbery and was being held in
lieu of $10,000 bail.

   A judge has opened an inquest behind
closed doors into the death of a police cadet who collapsed on the
first day of training, one of 16 cadets from the class who were
hospitalized.
   ``The bottom line is to determine whether or not one or more
persons violated criminal law or acted in criminal negligence,''
District Court Judge Irving Goldblatt said in an unusual news
conference before the proceeding began Monday.
   Timothy Shepard, 25, died Nov. 2 of blood poisoning and other
complications from the heat stroke he suffered Sept. 19 at the
regional police academy in Agawam. Fifteen other cadets among the
class of 50 were hospitalized for exhaustion and dehydration.
   He lingered for 44 days and underwent a liver transplant.
   Goldblatt said his report and witnesses' testimony will be made
public only if there are no grounds for criminal charges. But if the
judge sees evidence of a crime, the report and testimony will be
submitted to the district attorney, who will proceed to a grand
jury, he said.
   The judge also plans to visit the Agawam academy, one of six
regional centers operated by the state to train local police.
   Shepard's brother, father and widow were among the dozen people
at the inquest.
   ``I hope anybody responsible for Timmy being where he is right
now will be paid big time,'' said Christopher Shepard, 21, of
Pittsfield. ``I want them punished ... all of them.''
   Michael Hashim, an attorney for the Shepard family, said he
expected the testimony to take at least three weeks. The judge's
report is expected to take several more weeks.
   Hashim said the Shepards are the only people allowed to attend
the inquest daily, although the mother of another cadet went to the
courthouse in the vain hope of watching the proceeding.
   ``I want to know that justice is done. I felt so helpless
watching this go on,'' said the woman, who declined to give her name.
   Hashim has said the Shepard family wants criminal charges filed
against the cadet's trainers, State Troopers Blake Gilmore and John
Richardson. They led six other troopers in directing training on the
first day of the 14-week session.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops reportedly
shot and ounded at least a dozen Palestinians today as
stone-throwing demonstrations erupted in four towns or cities in the
occupied territories.
   The violence broke out as some Palestinians went on strike in
response to a call by Hamas, a Moslem fundamentalist group at odds
with the PLO-backed United Leadership of the Uprising.
   To try to block anti-Israeli violence during the strike, the army
imposed curfews on 14 refugee camps and villages in the Gaza Strip
as well as seven West Bank cities and towns, confining 370,000
residents to their homes.
   The army also strengthened patrols and made preventive arrests to
reduce the likelihood of clashes.
   Troops clashed with demonstrators in the Gaza village of
Jabaliya, wounding three Palestinians, including a 33-year-old woman
who was shot in the stomach and a 14-year-old boy who was hit in the
chest, officials at the Ahli Arab hospital said.
   Nine Palestinians also were reported wounded by army gunfire in
the West Bank city of Nablus and the nearby villages of Tamoun and
Beit Leid. One of the wounded was a 10-year-old boy shot in the left
leg, hospital officials said.
   At least 316 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed in the
nearly year-long revolt against Israeli occupation.
   About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza,
occupied by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   In the biblical town of Bethlehem today, youths from rival
Palestinian factions, some brandishing knives and clubs, shouted
threats at each other today in a dispute over the strike called by
Hamas, Arabic for zeal.
   The dispute stems from a Nov. 17 declaration by the Palestine
National Congress, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, accepting U.N.
resolutions that implicitly recognize Israel.
   The strike was to mark the anniversary of one of those
resolutions, a 1947 recommendation that Palestine be partitioned
into Jewish and Arab states.
   Members of Hamas marched through the city forcing stores shut.
Slogans scribbled in green paint on city walls warned merchants,
``Today is a strike day, be sure you observe it.'' Green is the
traditional color of Islam.
   Leaders of the United Leadership of the Uprising, who ordered
their own strike a day earlier, demanded shopkeepers open their
stores in defiance of the fundamentalists. They kicked closed shop
doors, shouting to owners that they would protect them from the
Islamic extremists if the shops opened.
   The strike was widely observed in the occupied Gaza Strip and
West Bank and Arab east Jersualem. The city of Hebron, where Hamas
is a dominant Palestinian faction, was totally shuttered.
   In Ramallah, north of Jerusalem, stores were closed, but people
could be seen going to work in offices on upper stories of buildings.
   One shopkeeper said stores were closed because youths from Hamas
threatened to stone those that opened. As reporters walked away, an
elderly man told the shopkeeper, ``Don't tell these things to
outsiders.''
   Palestinian officials have canceled Christmas celebrations in
Bethlehem, where Christ was born, in solidarity with the Palestinian
revolt.
   ``We don't see any reason to celebrate Christmas,'' Bethlehem
Deputy Mayor Hanna Nasser said Monday. ``We have to show concern for
our dead and for our detainees.''
   Nasser said the town government called off all official
celebrations, such as the Christmas Eve reception for Israeli and
Palestinian dignitaries and the annual Boy Scout parade.
   Manger Square, usually decorated with bright strings of colored
lights, will remain dark and its 40-foot Christmas tree will be left
bare, he said.
   Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin today urged his Labor
Party to consider joining a coalition government led by the rival
Likud bloc in order to withstand demands for controversial religious
legislation.
   On Monday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc
asked the Labor Party to join a new coalition government, offering
the rival party two of the four most powerful Cabinet posts.
   Labor leaders are meeting Wednesday to consider the offer.

   Mohammad Gul, self-described former
secret police officer and cousin of Afghan President Najib, said
today he fled Afghanistan to join anti-government Moslem guerrillas.
   He denounced Najib as ``a Russian puppet'' and said Najib's
mother once tried to escape from Kabul, only to be captured, chained
and struck by the president himself.
   ``I witnessed myself that he started slapping his mother ...
   ``Since Najib is not sincere to his own mother, how can he be
sincere to the nation?'' asked Mohammad Gul. He said Najib's mother,
Fahima, now was under virtual house arrest.
   The mustachioed 27-year-old said he used family connections and
his status in KHAD, the Afghan version of the Soviet KGB, to forge
papers and bribe his way out of Afghanistan.
   Mohammad Gul, who like former KHAD chief Najib does not use a
family surname, spoke at a news conference organized by the New
Delhi office of Hezb-i-Islami. The Pakistan-based group is one of
seven factions fighting Najib's forces and their Soviet military
backers in Afghanistan.
   Mohammad Gul said he has been granted refugee status in India by
the New Delhi office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
However, a U.N. official said his application, submitted about a
month ago, still was pending.
   The escapee said he and his wife left Kabul on Oct. 28 and flew
to New Delhi, where they were met by guerrilla representatives.
   ``My plan is to actively join the mujahedeen (guerrillas)... I
would like to go back to Afghanistan and fight Russians,'' said
Mohammad Gul.
   He is the second close relative of Najib to defect to the
guerrillas in less than five months. Last summer Najib's brother
Siddiqullah entered Pakistan with the guerrillas and accused Najib
of arranging the murder of their father. Siddiqullah offered no
proof. He later went to the United States.
   Mohammad Gul, who spoke in Pushtu through a guerrilla
interpreter, said at least 10 of Najib's close relatives have sought
refuge outside Afghanistan.
   He said he was doubly related to Najib through the intermarriages
common in Islamic societies. ``My mother and Najib's mother are
sisters, and my father and Najib's father are brothers,'' he said.
   Mohammad Gul said his brother Noorullah, a deputy minister of
tribal affairs, and Najib forced him to go to Moscow in 1987 for a
six-month secret police training course. Afterwar he returned to
Kabul and soon became a brigadier in KHAD.
   ``You can become a general in a week,'' he smiled when asked
about his meteoric rise.
   He said he never witnessed any of the tortures KHAD has been
accused of by the guerrillas and Kabul residents. His KHAD
assignment, said, was an undercover role reporting on Suleiman
Layeq, Afghanistan's minister of tribal affairs and a longtime
member of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   He echoed guerrilla assertions that Najib is doomed.
   ``The Kremlin leaders are trying to bring another person who
could replace Najib, a non-party person. Now the Russians are trying
to save their interests and go back,'' he said.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed last April, the Soviets have
withdrawn half their 115,000 soldiers from Afghanistan and are
supposed to withdraw the rest by Feb. 15.

   Iran's deputy foreign minister said today his
country will ``work as much as we can'' to gain freedom for all
foreign hostages in Lebanon, including Iranians he maintains are
held by a Christian militia.
   The hostage issue has dominated the state visit of German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who arrived Sunday.
   Genscher has offered to act as a mediator in gaining the release
of Western hostages, including nine Americans, believed held by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, West German government sources
in Bonn said.
   Genscher met for four hours Monday with Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati and held separate discussions with President Ali
Khamenei and Velayati's deputy, Mohammad Javad Larijani.
   Larijani told reporters today that ``there aren't just American
hostages in Lebanon, but there also are Iranian hostages, who are in
the hands of Christian militiamen.''
   He was referring to three Iranians who disappeared with their
Lebanese driver in 1982 and were presumed kidnapped by Christian
Phalangist gunmen. The four are widely believed to have died. No
group claimed responsibility for their kidnapping.
   ``Western nations, especially the United States, have close ties
to (the Phalangists),'' Larijani said. ``We want all hostages to be
free, the Iranians as well, and we will work as much as we can so
that they are freed.''
   Larijani did not specify what actions Iran might take.
   Genscher was to meet again today with Velayati, as well as Prime
Minister Hussein Musavi and Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   ``The issue of the hostages remains of the utmost concern to
us,'' said a West German official in Tehran who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``We are ready to do whatever we can to speed their
release.''
   Genscher's good contacts with Tehran throughout the Iran-Iraq war
were seen as key factors in the release of two West German hostages
who had been held in Lebanon.
   Genscher stressed in his talks that freeing the hostages is a
``humanitarian question that is independent of nationalities'' and
he ``urged the Iranians to continue their efforts toward ... (their)
release,'' said the West German official. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Westerners missing in Lebanon are nine Americans, three Britons,
an Italian, a Swiss and an Irishman. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.

   A hush-hush countdown continued today
with the space shuttle Atlantis and its five-man crew facing an
unfavorable weather forecast for Thursday's scheduled liftoff on a
secret military mission.
   Air Force weather officials said there was a 70 percent
probability the weather Thursday would violate launch criteria.
Heavy clouds, winds up to 28 mph and possible rain showers were
predicted.
   Capt. Ken Warren, an Air Force spokesman, reported these
conditions would be unacceptable, and he said the outlook for Friday
was about the same.
   The weather was high on the agenda as a 21-member team of
managers and engineers met today to evaluate all aspects of launch
preparations.
   The group was expected to issue a brief statement late in the day
on the readiness of Atlantis and its military crew for a mission
that reportedly will deploy the $500 million Lacrosse satellite to
spy on Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The decision-making team is headed by astronaut Robert Crippen,
NASA's deputy director for shuttle operations, who has sole
authority to approve or stop a launch.
   The astronauts were up early today to make proficiency training
flights in T-38 jet aircraft. They were scheduled later to review
their operations plan, check flight equipment and undergo medical
examinations.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, meanwhile,
remained silent on the exact status of the countdown after
announcing that it had started early Monday. Officials will only say
that the launch is set for sometime between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m.
Thursday.
   Sources reported today that the count was on time and that at 8
a.m. it entered an eight-hour, built-in hold. The hold is
contingency time in case the launch team has any catching up to do.
   Other sources have reported the liftoff will occur about 7 a.m.
if weather and other conditions are favorable.
   NASA and the Defense Department issue periodic reports that the
countdown is progressing but want to keep its precise status secret
to cloak the exact time of launch.
   There also will be a news blackout through the flight on what the
astronauts are doing in orbit.
   Pentagon officials contend the secrecy makes it more difficult
for the Soviet Union to monitor the flight and learn its purpose.
   But the Soviets, through its news agency Tass, have indicated
they know much about the mission.
   Tass said Sunday the main task of the flight is to release a new
generation reconnaissance satellite, codenamed Lacrosse, to
``conduct surveillance over the territory of the Soviet Union with
the help of updated radar.'' The agency also said the satellite will
play the role of ``eye'' for America's new B-2 stealth bomber.
   The Tass information is similar to that reported in recent weeks
in this country.
   The Atlantis commander is Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson, the pilot
is Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, and the mission specialists
are Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air
Force and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   Crippen's team of NASA and contractor experts was assembled for
the first time before September's launch of Discovery _ first
shuttle flight since the Challenger disaster of January 1986.
   One reason it was established was a breakdown in communications
that prevented cold weather concerns of some engineers from reaching
those who made the decision to launch Challenger on its ill-fated
mission. The cold was cited as contributing to the rocket failure
that destroyed the shuttle and killed its crew of seven.
   The Crippen team monitors the countdown closely and makes the
go-ahead decisions for important milestones such as filling
Atlantis' fuel tank, scheduled for Wednesday night.

   A former hostage in the 1985
hijacking of a TWA jetliner testified today the hijackers threatened
to kill an American passenger every five minutes unless their
demands for fuel were met.
   Debra Toga, a 30-year-old nurse who was seven months pregnant at
the time of the incident, also said that at one point one of the
hijackers held a gun to her head.
   Mrs. Toga testified at the trial of confessed TWA hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem charged with murder
and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking. Navy diver Robert Stethem
was killed in the ordeal and 39 Americans were hostage for 17 days.
   Mrs. Toga, who was returning from a three-week vacation with her
husband Arthur when the Athens-to-Rome flight was seized, said she
was not mistreated by the hijackers, but heard other passengers
being beaten.
   She said that during a stop in Algiers, the hijackers said they
would start killing Americans if the airplane was not refueled.
   ``Uli Derickson (the flight purser) told me that they were
threatening to kill one American passenger every five minutes,''
Mrs. Toga said.
   The plane was refueled and flew to Beirut airport.
   Mrs. Toga also said that Hamadi at one point reassured her she
was safe.
   ``I was crying, but Hamadi told me that I had nothing to worry
about. He said they were interested only in young American men, but
they respected women and children,'' Mrs. Toga said.
   Stethem was killed at Beirut airport. Hamadi admits he was one of
the hijackers, but denies shooting Stethem.
   Mrs. Toga said the other hijacker _ fugitive Hassan Ezzeddine _
threatened her with a gun just before she was freed in Algiers.
   ``I was chosen to leave the plane, and at that point I saw my
husband. I wanted to stay with my husband, but the other hijacker
put the gun to my head and told me to get out,'' she testified.
   Under guidelines set by the court, Mrs. Toga was not required to
disclose her hometown. At the time of the hijacking she and her
husband lived in St. Louis, Mo.
   Before Mrs. Toga's testimony, prosecutors disclosed that they had
had Hamadi's cell searched during the weekend for secret
communications the defendant may have received from acquaintances in
Beirut.
   Prosecutor Peter Korneck said some documents were taken from the
cell and photocopied, but he did not say what they were.
   Both Hamadi and his defense attorneys charged the search was
illegal and asked that Korneck be dropped from the case. Judge
Heiner Mueckenberger made no ruling on the motion.
   The defense attorneys also asked that officials from American
television networks be called to testify at the trial.
   The attorneys said they had asked the FBI and the U.S. Justice
Department for permission to examine tapes made during the hijacking
but there had been no reply. They indicated they wanted the network
officials to present the tapes in court.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   The nosewheel of an Indian Airlines
jetliner collapsed today as passengers were leaving the aircraft at
New Delhi's Indira Gandhi airport. At least six people were injured.
   The condition of one of the injured passengers was serious,
airline officials said.
   The front belly of the Airbus A-300 was severely damaged, United
News of India reported.
   An Indian Airlines official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the nosewheel collapsed as the front door of the jet was opened
and passengers began to disembark.
   The plane had carried 268 passengers and crew from the western
city of Bombay. Most passengers still were aboard when the accident
occurred.
   An Indian Airlines Boeing 737 crashed at Ahmedabad airport Oct.
19, killing 133 people. The crash sparked debates in Parliament,
with some politicians accusing the airline of poor maintenance.

   Tornado-shocked victims tried to put their
shattered lives and homes back in order today from a series of
twisters that killed four people, including a couple found with
their arms wrapped around each other.
   At least 17 tornadoes were reported early Monday, covering 200
miles of eastern North Carolina, injuring 151 people and causing
more than $50 million in damage.
   One tornado sent one couple on a flying-mattress ride. Mark and
Vera Cimerro landed on their mattress against a tree across the
street.
   ``I held onto her as tight as I could, and the next thing I know,
we are flying,'' said Cimerro. ``It was like a ride at the fair.''
   Their home was destroyed but they were not seriously injured.
   A neighbor, 8-year-old Janet Barnes, died when a chimney
collapsed on her bed.
   Further north in Raleigh, 12-year-old Edwin ``Pete'' Fulghum died
of head and chest injuries.
   In rural Nash County, Lee Roy Alston died with his arms wrapped
around his fatally injured wife, Mary, apparently in an effort to
shield her from the tornado that destroyed their mobile home,
authorities said. They had been thrown from the mobile home. Their
two children, ages 14 and 8, survived.
   Authorities had put the death toll at six, but later corrected it
to four.
   The tornadoes struck in nine counties, from Wake in the center of
the state, to Dare on the Atlantic Coast, authorities said. Most of
the damage was in Raleigh, where tornadoes cut a 10-mile swath.
   City Manager Dempsey Benton said the storm caused about $50
million in damage in Raleigh, the state capital. With about 85
percent of estimates completed, about 152 businesses and residential
buildings were destroyed, 301 buildings received major damage and
644 buildings minor damage, he said.
   About 500 people were left homeless in Raleigh.
   Damage estimates from other counties were not compiled.
   The storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a
250-mile path through the state in 1984, killing 44 people, injuring
more than 800 and leaving 2,300 homeless.
   Gov. Jim Martin asked the federal Small Business Administration
to declare Wake County a disaster area.
   The American Red Cross in Wake County got so many offers of
assistance that the agency ended up turning away some would-be
volunteers. Organizations rallied to supply everything from free
legal advice to tips about home repairs.
   The twisters destroyed mobile homes, damaged churches, toppled
several houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto houses
and streets.
   A K mart store was flattened by the twister, and six Raleigh
residents, including four juveniles, were charged Monday with
looting the store.
   More than 6,500 homes were left without power, but by Monday
night electricity had been restored to all but 1,100 customers of
Carolina Power & Light, said spokesman Kyle Hampton said.
   By nightfall Monday, most of those whose homes were damaged had
found somewhere to spend the night, either checking into hotels and
motels or staying with friends and relatives, authorities said.
   Only 17 people from five families spent the night at a Raleigh
middle school, the only shelter in Wake County, said Gloria Brown of
the county Department of Social Services.
   More than 300 families opened their homes to those affected by
the storm, said Helen Sibley, nurse coordinator for the local Red
Cross chapter.
   ``That's why there are not more people in the shelter,'' she
said. ``People in the city don't think other people care much about
them, but when something like this happens, we come together.''
   Farmers also suffered losses in the storms, said Jim Graham,
state Commissioner of Agriculture. Several egg production houses, 12
tobacco barns, 2,000 acres of timber, and two hog operations were
destroyed, Graham said.
   There were also losses of livestock in Wake, Halifax and Nash
counties.
   ``If federal disaster status is appropriate, I'll press for it
with all I've got,'' Graham said.
   The National Weather Service did not begin issuing tornado
warnings until 38 minutes after the first tornado touched down in
western Wake County because the twister was too close to radar to
monitor, authorities say.
   ``If you are looking straight up at a storm you can't see much,''
said Rod Gonski, a meteorologist with the weather service at Raleigh
Durham International Airport.
   In neighboring Virginia, one tornado and high wind downed trees,
damaged property and knocked out power in Isle of Wight, Brunswick
and Southampton counties early Monday, but no injuries were reported.
   At another scene of tornado damage, officials in Ruleville,
Miss., have decided there will be no classes for children there for
at least a week and preparations will be made to move high school
students to an empty building in a nearby town.
   A tornado cut a 60-foot-wide swath through Ruleville on Saturday,
destroying six homes and damaging the Delta town's three public
schools and other structures.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Begin Joint Development Of New Fighter Plane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By K.P. HONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Japan announced today they
will jointly develop a new fighter plane in a project expected to
cost more than $8 billion. Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno and
U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield signed an agreement under which Japan
will bear the costs of planning and producing the sophisticated
plane.
   The fighter, named the FSX, is to be developed by U.S. and
Japanese companies.
   Japanese officials have said the total cost of developing the
plane and producing an initial order of 130 and an expected
follow-up order _ both of which will go to Japan _ will be more than
$8.2 billion.
   Each FSX plane will cost the Japanese government $42.2 million,
Japanese defense officials said.
   The two allied countries had clashed on the question of U.S.
participation in the project _ Japan originally sought to develop
the jet using only Japanese companies and technology, while U.S.
officials pressed for a joint project to trim Japan's huge trade
surplus with the United States.
   The two sides reportedly agreed in June to allocate between 35
and 45 percent of the project to U.S. firms.
   But Defense Agency chief Kichiro Tazawa said today that ``the
details of the division of work between the two countries will be
decided later, taking into consideration such factors as economic
efficiency.''
   The new fighter will be based on General Dynamics' F-16,
according to the U.S. Defense Security Assistance Agency and Japan's
Defense Agency's Equipment Bureau.
   The Defense Agency named Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan the
prime contractor and General Dynamics of the United States as a
subcontractor. Two other major Japanese firms, Kawasaki Heavy
Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries, also were designated as
subcontractors.
   The Japanese technologies expected to be used in the plane
include a sophisticated radar, advanced materials and a special wing
to enhance maneuverability. The United States is expected to develop
a special engine with increased power.
   The plane will cost $1.35 billion to develop in eight years, the
Defense Agency said. It said mass production of the fighter plane is
expected to begin in 1997.
   The new fighter will replace Japan's F-1 planes _ the only
fighter developed by Japan since World War II _ and the F-4
fighter-interceptor planes. Japan has exempted the United States
from its ban on the export of military technology on condition that
usage of Japanese military technology would be limited to U.S.
defense activities.
   After Japan's defeat in World War II, U.S. occupation forces
closed Japan's aviation industry until 1952, when Japanese companies
began servicing U.S. aircraft in the Korean War.
   Since then, the domestic industry has depended heavily on
contracts from the Defense Agency, including development and
production of F-15 fighters under license from the U.S. company
McDonnell Douglas.
   Under Japan's ``no-war'' constitution written after World War II,
its Self-Defense Forces are one of the world's most heavily funded
military establishments and bans the introduction of nuclear arms
into the country.
   Japan is spending $27.82 billion annually for defense, or
slightly more than 1 percent of its projected gross national product.
   The United States maintains about 64,000 military personnel in
Japan under a mutual security treaty.

   ``Stay Tuned'' is the standard answer from the
Bush camp these days when asked about the timing of the next
appointments to administration jobs.
   Sheila Tate, spokeswoman for President-elect George Bush's
transition office, most recently gave the response when reporters
asked her when the new defense secretary might be named. ``And don't
be too far from the phone,'' she added.
   Bush, who insists that only he knows when appointments will come,
made a surprise announcement Monday, picking White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater to say on in the post. Tate had already taken
herself out of the running.
   Another woman dropped out of the race Monday, Labor Secretary Ann
McLaughlin. ``I have indicated to my own staff that I plan to return
to the private sector and find other ways to help,'' McLaughlin said
in Norfolk, Va.
   Bush already had indicated that he would not keep any more
incumbent Cabinet members in their jobs. Already staying are
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   For over a week, reports have circulated that former Sen. John
Tower of Texas is the front-runner for the Pentagon job. A source
close to the Bush transition office said a decision on Tower could
come today or Wednesday.
   The source, who spoke on condition he not be named, said the
president-elect likes Tower and thinks he would do a good job at the
Pentagon. But some Bush advisers have raised objections, partly
because they do not have a high regard for a number of people who
have worked for Tower and might have an inside track for top
Pentagon jobs should he be named.
   Another Texan, Robert Mosbacher, is supposed to have a lock on
the job of commerce secretary. Mosbacher, an oilman from Houston, is
a close friend of Bush's.
   Here is some other new speculation about key jobs:
   _ Two Missourians, Rep. E. Thomas Coleman of Missouri and Peter
C. Myers, the No. 2 person at the Agriculture Department, have
emerged as competitors for the top position at the department.
Coleman is the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture
Committee; Myers, a hog and grain farmer, has been head of the Soil
Conservation Service.
   _ Sources said Monday that Robert Helander, a former vice
president of the Pan American Society of New York, was being
mentioned as a possible successor to Elliott Abrams as assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs. Abrams was an
outspoken supporter of the Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas.
   _ Sources also said David Gergen, the editor-at-large of U.S.
News & World Report and a former White House communications chief,
may be a candidate to be ambassador to the Organization of American
States.
   _ Bush may also make a decision soon on the CIA director. Some
think he might keep current director William Webster in the post for
a limited length of time.

<HEAD>Scandal Widens Amid New York City School Boards</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigations into drug use, sexual harassment
and job-selling by members of the city's community school boards are
widening, and debate is rising over who should control the districts.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, Chancellor Richard Green and central Board
of Education President Robert F. Wagner Jr. planned to go to Albany
to lobby the Legislature today to allow a revamping of the current
decentralized arrangement.
   Bronx District Attorney Paul Gentile said Monday that ``evidence
exists to bring indictments'' of those accused of demanding money or
sexual favors in return for jobs. He is investigating two of the
boards.
   Wagner said the schools' inspector general is investigating six
district boards in Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn.
   Green has suspended District 9's board pending results of
Gentile's investigation into drug use by some members.
   At least two members of unidentified local school boards in the
Bronx have offered to cooperate with investigators, Green said.
   Green, Koch and Wagner planned to urge lawmakers to bar
politicians from running for local boards and using them as bases
for power and patronage. They also want to return to the chancellor
more power over principals of elementary and intermediate schools.
   The school system was decentralized 18 years ago, putting control
of the 800 schools for kindergarten through eighth or ninth grade in
the hands of 32 locally elected district boards. The high schools
remain under jurisdiction of the central board.
   Since school elections produced very small voter turnouts, many
boards were in many cases taken over by the politically connected.
   The sex and money demands were the latest news to rock the school
system, which is still grappling with the arrest of a Bronx
principal on crack-buying charges and the accusation that some local
school board members were regular cocaine users.
   Gentile said board members in several districts have been accused
of demanding sex for jobs or promotions.
   In an affidavit, a school aide has charged that a former
president of a school board in the Bronx blocked her promotion to a
paraprofessional job after she refused alleged repeated sexual
advances.
   The official, Jose M. Cruz, dismissed Yolanda Picart's charges as
``a woman's revenge.'' He said in today's Daily News that she was
upset over not being chosen for the paraprofessional job.
   The News also quoted unidentified sources as saying investigators
are looking into allegations that some board members may have used
school aides and district office workers as personal chauffeurs and
handymen.
   In a Manhattan district, a principal allegedly had to dip into
his pension to pay a board member so he could receive tenure, New
York Newsday reported.
   Gentile said his hotline had gotten 50 or 60 calls about
wrongdoing in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens and that he
was passing along information to the appropriate prosecutors.

<HEAD>Rights Court: Britain Violated Human Rights of Four Suspects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain violated the human rights of
four men held under anti-terrorism laws in Northern Ireland, the
European Court of Human Rights ruled today.
   It said Terrence Brogan, Dermot Coyle, William McFadden and
Michael Tracey are entitled to compensation because they were denied
speedy judicial hearings after their arrests in late 1984.
   Through Belfast lawyer Christopher Napier, the men said they
would seek substantial damages and return to the European court if
there were no amicable settlement.
   The four were detained for up to six days and 16 hours and
released without charge.
   The court upheld Britain's right to arrest suspected terrorists
without charging them with a specific offense. But it said detainees
must be granted a prompt hearing before a judge.
   The men were arrested as part of Britain's campaign against the
outlawed Irish Republican Army that seeks to end British rule in
Northern Ireland through a campaign of terrorist violence.
   Roman Catholic nationalists in Northern Ireland welcomed the
decision, but legislators said the court failed to understand
Britain's battle against the IRA.
   The British government said it was studying the decision and
would respond in Parliament at an unspecified date.
   ``We have to consider the human rights of the victims and
potential victims of terrorism as well as those suspected of
terrorist involvement,'' said a statement from the Home Office,
which is responsible for law and order.
   Danny Morrison, a spokesman for the IRA's legal political wing
Sinn Fein, said: ``Once again the British have been found guilty of
abusing human rights in the North.''
   Merlyn Rees, a Labor Party lawmaker and former Cabinet minister
responsible for Northern Ireland, criticized the ruling. But he said
Britain will have to accept it ``because part of our problem is
convincing the world that we are not a repressive colonial
government in Northern Ireland.''
   Neil Hamilton, a legislator from the governing Conservative
party, said the judgment shows ``no understanding of the terrorist
threat to Britain and the government should reject it out of hand.''
   Under Northern Ireland's anti-terrorism law persons simply
suspected of terrorist activities can be arrested.
   But the European court found none of the men ``was either brought
`promptly' before a judicial authority or released `promptly'
following his arrest.''
   The court did not define promptness except to say the human
rights convention allows ``only a limited degree of flexibility'' to
extend the duration of detention.
   Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act permits suspected
terrorists to be detained for 48 hours, although the government can
extend that for another five days.
   According to latest figures available at the Northern Ireland
Office, 411 were arrested between January and March this year, of
whom 121 were held beyond 48 hours.
   The European Court of Human Rights is part of the 21-nation
Council of Europe, the oldest organization working toward more
European integration. The court's rulings are not legally binding
but rarely are ignored.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Soviet
parliament today it would gain the right to veto his decisions if it
adopts his revised proposals to overhaul the Soviet political system.
   In a speech opening a three-day special session of the Supreme
Soviet, or parliament, Gorbachev said the Kremlin leadership made
the veto proposal among 88 changes it recommended in response to
250,000 public comments on the new election law and constitutional
amendments put before the body today.
   Two high republic officials from the Baltics, however, registered
dissatisfaction with elements of the reform program when addressing
the plenum, signalling the start of a genuine debate in the chamber
where ritual ascent is the norm.
   The original drafts, published just five weeks ago, sparked
widespread criticism that the changes would concentrate too much
power in the presidency in a nation with a history of dictatorship.
   In a reference to the outcry, Gorbachev acknowledged, ``It is
obvious that some of the provisions of the bills were not formulated
precisely enough and caused quite a few critical remarks in the
course of the discussions.''
   Reading today from a new draft, Gorbachev said the Supreme Soviet
``has the right to veto decrees of the presidium, instructions of
the president of the Supreme Soviet,'' and the leadership would be
required to account to the legislature ``at least once a year.''
   Currently, directives from the president are made in the name of
the Presidium and are subject to confirmation at the next full
session of the Supreme Soviet. But practically, there are no
challenges. The Supreme Soviet had its first non-unanimous vote in
memory last month.
   Gorbachev promised that other changes also would preserve the
Soviet Union's traditional collective style of leadership. Under
that style, the highest government body _ the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet _ and the highest party body _ the Politburo _ are
collective bodies. The head of the Presidium is the president,
traditionally a ceremonial role.
   It was not immediately clear whether Gorbachev was giving up his
original proposal to strengthen the president's role by giving him
chairmanship of the Defense Council and responsibility for
overseeing foreign policy.
   The latest draft of the proposed changes also responded to
complaints from small republics, including Estonia, Latvia and
Georgia, by increasing the republics' representation in one of the
houses of the bicameral parliament.
   Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov asked that the reform package
be postponed to consider objections by his parliament, including one
to the possibility of an individual occupying several seats in the
new Congress of People's Deputies.
   Another Baltic president, Vitautas Astrauskas of Lithuania,
called for a convention to write a new constitution that would give
the central government authority to decide issues of national scope
and reserve all other matters for the republics.
   But he welcomed Gorbachev's announced changes and accepted the
president's proposal to put off issues of the rights of republics
until later.
   Gorbachev proposed creating a special commission to settle the
question of division of power between the 15 Soviet republics and
the central government and suggested the deputies limit this session
to overhauling the government structure.
   He said the complex questions of the rights of the republics and
the powers of local legislative bodies, known as soviets, or
councils, could be left for later.
   ``We have just embarked on reform,'' he said. ``In this
revolutionary period, we are blowing up the old structure.'' The
first step in reconstruction is the overhaul now before the
parliament, he said.
   Gorbachev rejected complaints that the principle of one man, one
vote is violated by a plan to let organizations, such as the
Communist Party and trade unions, elect one-third of the deputies in
a new Congress of People's Deputies.
   He said the reform clearly states that legislative elections can
have multiple candidates, but added that because numerous candidates
could be proposed, they must face ``preliminary discussion'' before
their local nominating commissions. It was not known whether the
commissions could reject specific candidates.
   The Soviet leader also hinted at promised future reforms. They
include a rewrite of the preamble of the Soviet constitution,
including the ``definition of socialist property.''
   The 1,500-member legislative body met in special session one day
after the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee endorsed
the changes, a move that in the past would have paved the way for
unanimous approval by the parliament.

   A ``good Samaritan'' who shot two muggers asked

to 1{ to 4{ years in prison, only slightly less than the maximum
two- to six-year sentence he could have received.
   ``If he's such a fine person, why did he have a Brazilian-made
Saturday night special?'' Slavin said at the sentencing Monday.
``You said you want to be an honest citizen; well, you can be an
honest citizen when you get out of jail.''
   Fearon, who came to New York from Jamaica five years ago, had
pleaded guilty in February 1987 to felony charges for directing two
undercover police officers to a drug dealer who sold them two vials
of crack.
   A fugitive since March 1987 who had been living under an assumed
name, Fearon's identity was revealed Nov. 2 when he came to the
rescue of a woman being robbed on the street outside his home. He
killed one man and wounded another, using an unregistered handgun.
   ``I knew that getting involved could lead to my exposure,''
Fearon said at his sentencing. ``I did not want to get involved, but
I knew I had to do something to help.''
   Slavin last year had promised Fearon a sentence of one day in
jail and five years probation on the drug conviction, but had warned
him if he did not appear for sentencing he would impose a two- to
six-year prison term.
   Fearon, who read from a written statement, told the judge Monday
that the reason he did not come to his sentencing was that an
immigration lawyer had told him that he could be deported to Jamaica.
   ``I was afraid. I did not want to go back to Jamaica because I
love America. I know it is the land of opportunity,'' Fearon said.
   He said that after he became a fugitive he made a vow to himself
to be a law-abiding citizen and had worked as many as three jobs at
a time to support a wife and two children in Jamaica.
   Slavin said he reduced the sentence ``for his _ quote _
`heroism.''' But the judge chided Fearon for going underground and
changing his name and for owning the unlicensed gun which he used to
shoot the two muggers.
   Fearon must serve the minimum of 1{ years before being eligible
for parole.
   The mugging victim, Gertrude George, was not in court on Monday
but had sent Slavin a letter urging him to be lenient. He had also
received 50 other letters of support and petitions signed by people
who lived in Fearon's neighborhood of East Flatbush.

<HEAD>Court Says Ohio Court Erroneously Upheld Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that an Ohio
court erroneously upheld the rape, robbery and assault convictions
of a man whose court-appointed lawyer withdrew from the case.
   In an 8-1 decision, the high court said the Ohio Court of Appeals
should not have decided on Steven Anthony Penson's appeal of rape,
robbery and assault convictions without first appointing a new
attorney to handle the case.
   ``The need for forceful advocacy does not come to an abrupt halt
as the legal proceeding moves from the trial to appellate stage,''
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court, which ordered further
hearings on the case.
   Stevens said the Ohio tribunal ``erred by failing to appoint new
counsel to represent petitioner'' after determining that Penson's
case raised several possible legal issues for appellate review.
   Penson's original court-appointed lawyer was allowed to withdraw
from the appeal after filing a statement that he found no legal
errors by the trial judge that required reversal of the convictions.
   The appeals court then denied Penson's request for a new lawyer
but later reviewed the trial record and found that the defendant had
``several arguable claims.''
   The court reversed one of the three convictions stemming from
Penson's involvement with two other men in the Aug. 4, 1984,
break-in of a Montgomery County, Ohio, home.
   But it ultimately concluded that Penson ``suffered no prejudice''
from his court-appointed lawyer's ``failure to give a more
conscientious examination of the record'' and upheld the remaining
two convictions.
   Penson, who is serving an 18-to-28-year sentence, was one of
three men convicted of breaking into the home and sexually
assaulting a man and two women, who were also robbed.
   Stevens said the Ohio court violated standards set by the high
court in a 1967 opinion for judging the effectiveness of
court-appointed lawyers handling appeals.
   ``Both stages of the prosecution, although perhaps involving
unique legal skills, require careful advocacy to ensure that rights
are not foregone and that substantial legal and factual arguments
are not inadvertently passed over,'' Stevens wrote in an opinion
that drew a dissent from Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
   ``It bears emphasis that the right to be represented by counsel
is among the most fundamental rights,'' Stevens wrote.
   ``We have long recognized that `lawyers in criminal courts are
necessities, not luxuries','' the court's majority said, quoting
from its landmark 1963 decision in Gideon v. Wainwright that
mandated court-appointed lawyers for indigent defendants.
   But Rehnquist called the decision ``a futile monument to the
court's effort to guarantee to the indigent appellant what no court
can guarantee him: exactly the same sort of legal services that
would be provided suitably by retained private counsel.''
   Rehnquist said the Ohio court's review of the trial record
without assistance of Penson's lawyer resulted in the proper finding
that the defendant's rights were not prejudiced.
   But the court's majority rejected this view, saying that the Ohio
tribunal could not justify its refusal to appoint a new lawyer on
the ground there was no merit to Penson's appeal.
   ``Finding harmless error or a lack of... prejudice in cases such
as this, however, would leave criminal appealants without any
protections'' under the 1967 decision, Stevens wrote.
   The case is Penson v. Ohio, 87-6116.

<HEAD>Witness: Steinberg Slapped Child for No Asparent Reason</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man on trial for murder in the beating of his
illegally adopted daughter once whacked the sleeping 6-year-old in
the face ``out of the clear blue sky,'' a witness testified.
   The witness, alleged drug dealer Charles Scannapieco, on Monday
became the first person to testify that he actually saw Joel
Steinberg, a now-disbarred lawyer, strike Lisa Steinberg.
   Scannapieco said Steinberg hit the girl hard enough ``to bring
tears'' and for no apparent reason.
   Meanwhile, Steinberg faces a $3 million lawsuit filed by his
former live-in lover, Hedda Nussbaum. The suit, filed in state court
Monday, alleges Steinberg assaulted and tortured her for most of the
11 years they lived together.
   Nussbaum also charged that he used humiliation, brainwashing,
drugs and the withholding of food to teach her that ``she was a
worthless person who could only be saved through his wisdom and
special powers.''
   Nussbaum is expected to testify against Steinberg in the murder
trial.
   Scannapieco, who has been indicted on narcotics charges, had
hired Steinberg to represent him. Scannapieco said he saw Steinberg
strike Lisa on Oct. 23, 1987, as Steinberg drove them to
Scannapieco's home in Lake Katrine in upstate New York.
   More than 20 witnesses have testified against Steinberg so far,
but Scannapieco is the first to report having seen Steinberg strike
the girl.
   ``Right after she fell asleep,'' Scannapieco said, ``right out of
the clear blue sky, Mr. Steinberg took his hand and went ...
(demonstrating the blow) SMASH!''
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax struck the word
``smash'' from the record at the request of Steinberg's lawyer, Ira
London.
   Demonstrating the blow, Scannapieco slammed the back of his hand
against the judge's bench. The judge, Steinberg and the jurors
seemed startled. Steinberg smiled and shook his head as if in
disbelief at Scannapieco's dramatic gesture.
   Scannapieco said the slap on the right side of Lisa's face ``was
pretty forceful, enough to bring tears to your eyes.''
   She woke up and looked at Steinberg, who told her to ``stop
staring at him and keep blinking and smiling. Keep blinking and
smiling _ that's what she was told to do,'' Scannapieco said. He
said Steinberg told Lisa this five or six times.
   Steinberg did not seem angry, Scannapieco said.
   Scannapieco said Steinberg told him he hit the child because she
sometimes slowed her heart and breathing, putting herself into a
near coma. He quoted Steinberg as saying it was a medical condition
that ``got so serious one time that he had to put her in the
hospital.''
   Lisa was removed unconscious from Steinberg's Greenwich Village
apartment on Nov. 2, 1987, and died of head injuries three days
later.
   Steinberg has denied hitting the child. He has said she fell
unconscious after choking on food and that he caused bruises on her
chest and back while trying to revive her.
   A report in Monday's New York Newsday quoted court sources as
saying that in the month before Lisa's death, Steinberg free-based
cocaine nightly from a kilogram that had been left with him for
safekeeping by a client.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that police do
not violate the rights of criminal defendants when, through
negligence, they fail to preserve vital evidence or to conduct
state-of-the-art laboratory tests.
   The justices, voting 6-3, reinstated the conviction of an Arizona
man in the kidnaping and sodomizing of a 10-year-old boy.
   A lower court had thrown out the conviction and 10-year prison
sentence of Larry Youngblood because police failed to preserve
properly semen samples from the child's body and clothing.
   But today Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in his opinion for
the high court, said, ``The situation here is no different than a
prosecution for drunk driving that rests on police observation
alone.''
   ``The defendant is free to argue ... that a Breathalyzer test
might have been exculpatory,'' he said. ``But the police do not have
a constitutional duty to perform any particular tests.''
   Rehnquist said that as long as the failure to conduct the tests
was a result of police negligence, and not bad faith, the rights of
the defendant are not violated.
   ``Unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of
the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not
constitute a denial of due process of law,'' Rehnquist said.
   In another decision, the justices ruled that an Ohio court
erroneously upheld the rape, robbery and assault convictions of a
man whose court-appointed lawyer withdrew from the case.
   Voting 8-1, the high court said the Ohio Court of Appeals should
not have decided on Steven Anthony Penson's appeal of rape, robbery
and assault convictions without first appointing a new attorney to
handle the case.
   In the evidence case, Youngblood was convicted of kidnaping his
victim on Oct. 29, 1983, from a carnival in the Tucson area. Police
said the boy was driven to a house, raped four times during a
90-minute ordeal and then released.
   The boy identified Youngblood as his attacker from photographs
shown to him by police. Youngblood was convicted of child molesting,
sexual assault and kidnaping.
   Laboratory specialists found traces of semen on the boy and also
in clothing he was wearing.
   It was not until a year later that the semen was tested to
determine blood typing of the assailant. But no blood group
substances were found.
   The semen sample taken from the boy's body was refrigerated. The
clothing, which might have contained a larger quantity of semen, was
not.
   Youngblood was determined to be what is known as a secretor, with
blood type A. That means that his blood group could be determined
from his semen.
   The absence of blood group substances in the semen taken from the
victim suggested that the boy's attacker either was a non-secretor
or that the samples were too small to determine blood type.
   There also was testimony that technologically advanced tests to
determine blood grouping were not performed on the semen samples.
   An Arizona appeals court threw out Youngblood's conviction on
grounds that had state-of-the-art tests been performed and had the
best technology been used to preserve the evidence, Youngblood might
have been found innocent.
   Dissenting today were Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J.
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall.
   Blackmun, writing for all three, said, ``An understanding of due
process demonstrates that the evidence which was allowed to
deteriorate was `constitutionally material', and that its absence
significantly prejudiced'' Youngblood.
   The case is Arizona vs. Youngblood, 86-1904.

<TEXT>
   The recent murders of three drifters in Balboa
Park have been linked to a single killer, and police are urging male
transients and homosexuals to avoid the park at night.
   ``We are worried that there is someone out there who may kill
again,'' Sgt. Hank Olias said Monday.
   ``We know that two of the three victims were transients and at
least two were homosexual,'' he said.
   The type of gun used is the common link among the slayings, said
police spokesman Dave Cohen, who declined to elaborate. Each victim
died of multiple gunshot wounds in the separate shootings over the
past two weeks.
   ``Single men by themselves in the park after dark should use
extreme care,'' Deputy Police Chief Mike Rice said. ``There is
someone out there who has already killed three of them.''
   Police assigned extra patrol units to the park Monday night to
increase surveillance and warn park users of the danger.
   Up to several hundred drifters are estimated to seek shelter at
night in the sprawling park, which is less than one mile north of
downtown San Diego.
   ``It fluctuates,'' said department spokesman Bill Robinson. ``No
one has been able to conduct a tally, but it's been as high as in
the hundreds because many hide in the canyons.''
   Homicide detectives refused to discuss evidence related to the
killings, saying through Robinson only that their investigation has
``conclusively linked three recent homicides in Balboa Park.''
   ``Right now, they're playing it pretty close to the vest because
it is a new series that we've just been able to put together,''
Robinson said.
   The series began with the Nov. 19 discovery of the body of
transient David Siino, 31. Olias said he was staying at a downtown
hotel and had been in the San Diego area for the past eight months.
   The body of Edward Hope, 60, was found Friday. Hope, who had been
dead for three to five days, is believed to have arrived from Nevada
days before his death, Olias said.
   The most recent victim was identified as Brian Poole, 36, a
transient from Torrington, Conn., whose body was found Saturday in a
park bathroom. He apparently had been living out of his car, which
was parked nearby, Olias said.
   None of the victims apparently had local jobs or knew either of
the others, said Olias, who emphasized that it isn't known whether
the killer is targeting gay men, transients or both.
   The restroom where Poole was killed has a longstanding reputation
as a meeting place for homosexuals, said Olais, who noted it's also
in an area of the park where a sharp rise in assaults and burglaries
last month prompted police to temporarily increase patrols.
   Police blamed most of the earlier crime wave on a band of illegal
aliens, but Lt. Phil Jarvis said he doesn't think the recent
killings are related.
   ``Based on what we know, we don't think we have seen the same
person,'' Jarvis said. ``There is no evidence (in the recent
shootings) of robbery.''

   A 3-year-old girl who has spent most of her
life in the hospital underwent a rare, five-organ transplant today
that doctors said was her only chance for survival.
   Rolandrea Dodge of Fruitland, N.M., went into surgery around 11
p.m. Monday. The complicated operation was expected to end early in
the afternoon at the earliest, said spokesmen at Children's Hospital
of Pittsburgh.
   The surgical team, headed by Dr. Satoru Todo, was implanting a
new liver, pancreas, part of a stomach and small and large
intestines into the child. The organs were procured by transplant
pioneer Dr. Thomas E. Starzl from a single donor, a child whose
identity was withheld.
   ``The surgery is going very smoothly,'' hospital spokeswoman Sue
Cardillo said.
   Rolandrea, who is usually known as Rolly, arrived at Children's
Hospital in mid-October to be evaluated for a multiple organ
transplant. She was accompanied by her parents, Branden and Cyndi
Dodge, who also have two sons.
   Roll was born with the incurable disease intractable secretory
diarrhea, which prevented her intestines from absorbing food and
liquids. She had to be fed intravenously, although she was allowed
occasional nibbles of candy, potatoes and other solid food.
   Aside from brief outings, Rolly has spent her entire life in
hospitals. Doctors in New Mexico said she wouldn't survive long
unless she underwent a multiple organ transplant.
   The girl's liver began failing about three months ago, and her
skin became jaundiced, or yellow in color because of bile pigments
in the blood.
   Doctors began administering an experimental drug on Nov. 9 in
hopes of allowing her intestines to absorb food and liquids, but it
was unsuccessful, Ms. Cardillo said.
   ``That was really the last available treatment option,'' she said.
   Dodge, 27, a surface coal miner, said shortly after arriving in
Pittsburgh that it was difficult deciding whether to allow Rolly to
undergo the experimental transplant. But, he said, ``It's the only
hope that we've got left.''
   ``We don't have any doubts,'' he said. ``It's just the way our
(American) Indian people are. That's just the way they taught us:
Try not to think negative about things, it's going to work out.''
   The Dodges are Navajo and have received pledges of support from
the Navajo Tribal Council in Window Rock, Ariz.
   Abdominal transplants involving two or more organs previously
have been performed only four times in the United States, and all
the patients have died. The longest survivor, Tabatha Foster, 3{, of
Madisonville, Ky., died of a bloodstream infection in May, six
months after receiving a record five organs at Children's Hospital.

   A career criminal who disarmed an officer and used
the gun to fatally shoot the policeman and another officer admitted
killing the men and begged not to be killed after he was captured,
officials said.
   Charles Harry Street, 34, of Boynton Beach, was arrested less
than an hour after Monday's early morning shooting when he threw
down one of the slain officer's service revolver, police said.
   ``I killed two cops,'' he told Broward County Deputy Gregory
Mentzer. ``Lord, don't kill me for it.''
   Street, whose criminal record is more than 20 pages long and
dates to 1972, was charged today with two counts of first-degree
murder and other charges in Dade County Circuit Court. He was
ordered held without bond by Judge Jack Coe.
   Street's most recent conviction was for attempted murder in West
Palm Beach in 1980. He was released from prison 10 days before
Monday's shootings.
   Metro-Dade officer Richard Boles, 41, a four-year veteran with a
wife and two children, died at Jackson Memorial Hospital shortly
after the shooting north of Miami. Officer David Strzalkowski, 34, a
six-year veteran with a pregnant wife and young son, also was killed.
   Each was shot at least three times with one of their service
revolvers, said Metro-Dade Police Director Fred Taylor.
   Street apparently grabbed the gun after he attacked the officers
with a piece of pipe, Taylor said.
   They were wearing bullet-proof vests when they were shot,
authorities said.
   ``Both of the officers had head wounds, very serious head
wounds,'' Taylor said, ``as well as (wounds) to the arms and
shoulders and about the tops of their bodies.''
   The killings occured less than hour after Street had called for
an ambulance at a gas station because he was feeling ill.
   But Street left the ambulance and set out on foot after deciding
not to go to the hospital. Both officers were called after residents
at a trailer park complained of a screaming man throwing stones and
a broken car tailpipe at mobile homes and passing cars.
   A man who said he saw the killings from about 15 feet away
reported seeing a tall man grapple first with one, then with both
officers.
   ``They tried to take him, but they were not strong enough to keep
him in their arms,'' said the witness, who refused to give his name.
``He was stronger and bigger than they were.''
   The witness, who said he was a 66-year-old retired businessman
from western Quebec, said the man then shot both officers, stole one
of their patrol cars and drove off.
   The suspect drove away one of the slain officer's cruisers, with
lights still flashing, to Hollywood, where he ditched the car and
commandeered another car from a woman stopped at an intersection,
police said.
   Police arrested Street a short time later after he abandoned that
car and set out on foot.
   Earlier convictions against Street included two assaults on
police officers, battery, resisting arrest with violence, aggravated
assault on an officer and grand larceny, said Bob MacMaster, a
Florida Department of Corrections spokesman.
   Street was most recently released after serving a little more
than half of his 15-year attempted-murder sentence despite numerous
disciplinary reports written by corrections officers stemming from
fights with inmates, MacMaster said.

   A cocaine overdose killed a young princess
whose husband, a great-grandson of Germany's last emperor,
subsequently killed himself in shock and grief, police said today.
   Isabelle of Hanover, 26, was found dead Monday by her husband,
Prince Ludwig Rudolf, in the bedroom of their villa at Gmunden, a
lakeside resort in Upper Austria's Salzkammergut lake district.
   Police sources in Gmunden and in Linz, the capital of Upper
Austria province, said today a preliminary autopsy showed the
Austrian-born princess died of heart and lung edema after consuming
cocaine.
   A spokesman for Upper Austria security police who asked not to be
identified said syringes and a small amount of ``powder'' were found
near the body of the princess.
   The Austria Press Agency, quoting a source in the public
prosecutor's office, said the powder was cocaine.
   The public prosecutor's office at Wels, Upper Austria, said
investigators found punctures on the arms of the dead prince and
princess, suggesting both used narcotics.
   The result of an official post-mortem was expected later this
week. Police said the case also is under court investigation.
   The 33-year-old prince, a relative of the British, Greek and
Spanish royal families, was found shot to death near a lake at
Almtal, a wooded area some 20 miles from Gmunden, police said. His
hunting rifle was beside him, police said.
   The couple is survived by their infant son, Prince Otto, who
slept next door to the bedroom where his mother was found dead,
Austrian newspapers said.
   Police said the prince and his wife dined Sunday night with
members of a West German pop group.
   The princess retired early and was found dead by her husband at
2:45 a.m. The prince called the Red Cross and told them his wife had
``probably taken cocaine,'' a police spokesman said.
   Prince Ludwig Rudolf, the second of three sons of Prince Ernst
August of Hanover, was the grandson of Emperor Wilhelm II's daughter
Viktoria Luise of Brunswick-Luneburg.
   The couple was part of the European jet set, moving in the world
of rock music and fashion. The prince spent many years in London,
and the princess attended a fashionable school in England.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bernard-Henri Levy, the ``enfant terrible'' of
French intellectuals, won the prestigious Interallie literary prize
today for his account of the decadent life of Romantic poet Charles
Baudelaire.
   ``The Last Days of Charles Baudelaire,'' a best-seller, is a
fictionalized biography of the 19th century author known for the
sensory imagery of his ``Flowers of Evil,'' a poetry collection
condemned in its time for obscenity.
   In his book, Levy created dialogue spoken by Baudelaire, his
mixed-race lover, his mother and his publisher to recount the
agonizing last years of a religious mystic who frequented Paris
prostitutes and died of syphilis.
   The 39-year-old Levy, known as a ``new philosopher,'' catapulted
to intellectual stardom in 1977 when he attacked Marxism, claiming
it inevitably led to totalitarianism.
   Last year, in ``L'Eloge des Intellectuals,'' (In Praise of
Intellectuals), Levy lambasted French intellectuals for remaining
silent on important social and political issues.
   In 1981, he provoked debate with ``L'Ideologie Francaise,''
(French Ideology) an essay denouncing the French mentality that
produced a World War II government that collaborated with the Nazi
occupation.
   Levy's best-selling ``Le Diable en Tete'' (The Devil Ahead), a
20th century epic, was published in 1984.
   Brilliant, handsome and not one to mince words, Levy once
described himself as ``the best writer and the most talented
essayist of my generation.''
   The winner of the Interallie prize, sponsored by the Cercle
Interallie, is awarded $765.
   This year's Chateaubriand prize was awarded today to

<HEAD>Circuit Breaker Inspections Ordered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has ordered
the nation's 110 nuclear plants to locate and test possibly
counterfeit and faulty circuit breakers installed in safety systems,
an NRC spokesman confirmed today.
   Spokesman Frank Ingram said a Nov. 22 bulletin issued by the
commission found that recent inspections ``indicate a potential
safety concern regarding electrical equipment supplied to nuclear
power plants.''
   However, a counterfeit or faulty breaker has never been blamed
for any kind of incident at a nuclear plant, Ingram said.
   The order for inspections, which must be carried out by March 1,
followed an NRC investigation that found four Southern California
companies had allegedly sold counterfeit breakers to nuclear plants.
   Pacific Gas & Electric reported in July that it had found 30
counterfeit breakers in its inventory at the Diablo Canyon nuclear
plant near San Luis Obispo.
   Southern California Edison Co. found in the same month that it
had bought 16 potentially counterfeit breakers for its San Onofre
plant, 55 miles south of Los Angeles.
   The NRC said in the bulletin that the inspections are necessary
``to provide reasonable assurance that nuclear power plants can be
operated without undue risk to the public health and safety.''
   The NRC has found ``numerous failures'' of certain types of
circuit breakers during preliminary commission-supervised tests, the
bulletin said.
   If a potentially counterfeit breaker is found already installed _
and it cannot be immediately tested _ the utility must submit ``an
analysis justifying continued operation,'' the bulletin said.
   The Los Angeles Times reported today that the inspection plan was
criticized in a memorandum attached to the bulletin by Underwriters
Laboratory, a nonprofit testing agency that certifies circuit
breakers.
   ``The test program is not adequate to provide assurance that the
tested ... circuit breakers would be suitable for their intended
purpose,'' the laboratory said.
   The NRC responded by saying that it ``considers the test program
to provide a reasonable assurance of performance requirements and
characteristics most important to ensuring reactor safety.''
   The NRC has told utilities that more than 50 companies may be
counterfeiting circuit breakers and other electrical components.
   PG&E spokesman Dick Davin said the utility was still evaluating
the order and how it would affect the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant.
   Southern California Edison Co. spokesman Dave Barron said the San
Onofre plant had not yet received the order, but that the utility
would comply.

<HEAD>Man Linked to Terrorist Group Offers to Admit Bomb Charges</HEAD>

guilty, picking up 6th graf pvs, `Last month ....'</NOTE>

   A federal judge today found a Japanese man
linked to a terrorist group guilty of transporting bombs on the New
Jersey Turnpike after the man agreed to the government's description
of the incident.
   In a surprise announcement Monday, defense attorneys William
Kunstler and Ronald Kuby said they would accept the government's
claims about Yu Kikumura, who has been linked to the Japanese Red
Army, on the condition that Kikumura can maintain his right to
appeal pre-trial rulings in the case.
   Federal prosecutors said today in court they would accept the
condition.
   Although Kikumura admitted to the government's account of his
actions, if the pre-trial rulings, which bear on the admissibility
of evidence against him, are overturned, his conviction could be
thrown out.
   U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. asked Kikumura a series
of questions to make sure he understood what he was doing in a
procedure similar to that used in guilty pleas. In essence, Kikumura
agreed to the charges and waived his right to a jury trial.
   ``There is no contest and there is no alternative,'' Lechner
said. ``I find the defendant Yu Kikumura guilty of each count of the
indictment.''
   Outside the courthouse, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said
Kikumura had come to this country ``to kill people.''
   ``This man is an international terrorist who sneakd into the
United States using a skillfully forged passpport,'' Alito said.
   If he had not been stopped, ``there would have been some people
killed and maimed,'' he said.
   Kunstler later told reporters that the government had wanted to
create a ``show trial,'' and that the case was indefensible. But
because evidence was illegally seized, he predicted, the conviction
would be overturned.
   ``If you take away the constitutional rights of Yu Kikumura, you
can take away the rights of anybody,'' said Ronald Kuby, another
defense attorney.
   The defense proposed its deal Monday before jury selection began
and moments after it lost an argument to have the indictment
dismissed.
   Last month, Lechner denied a motion to disqualify evidence _
namely, the three homemade bombs made of fire extinguisher
canisters, explosives paraphernalia and numerous personal items
found in Kikumura's car when he was arrested at a rest stop April 12
in Ridgefield, less than five miles east of New York City.
   On Monday, Kuby and Kunstler asked Lechner to dismiss the
indictment after prosecutors disclosed that Kikumura's phone calls
with defense attorneys were recorded at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in New York City.
   All inmates' calls at the institution are recorded as a matter of
course, although attorney-client calls are not supposed to be
listened to. Previously, prosecutors had said the lawyer calls were
not recorded.
   Lechner found that the defense had not shown that any evidence
was tainted or that the government benefited from the taping.
   Kunstler said his client would ``stipulate'' to the charges in
the indictment _ an acknowledgement but not a formal guilty plea _
as long as Kikumura could be allowed to appeal Lechner's ruling that
the evidence was legally seized and other issues.
   ``We want to save the court's time, we want to save the
taxpayers' money,'' Kunstler said, adding that if the government
insisted on bringing the case before a jury, it would ``cause
essentially a show trial where we will be mute.''
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. angrily objected to Kunstler's
raising plea negotiations in public, calling it ``unprecedented.''
   Lechner told both sides to discuss the matter, and report back
today. He also told the 130 potential jurors to return today.
   Federal authorities have said Kikumura, 36, may be linked to the
Japanese Red Army, a terrorist organization. Court documents showed
he had traveled about 7,000 miles throughout the Northeast after
arriving in the United States fie weeks before his arrest.
   In testimony Monday, FBI agents said more than 25 agents in
cities nationwide were involved in the investigation. People from
four countries were on the government's witness list, said defense
co-counsel Ronald Kuby.
   Kuby said there were three main issues to present to an appellate
court: contentions that the stop and search of Kikumura's car was
illegal and hence the evidence inadmissible; that the charges are
repetitive because they carry 90 years in prison terms; and that the
government may have had access to privileged attorney-client
conversations through the corrections center phone recordings.

   The U.S. economy, held back by the summer
drought, expanded at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate in the
July-September quarter, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the performance of the gross
national product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed in
the third quarter after growing at an annual rate of 3.2 percent
during the first six months of the year.
   It was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986, when
the economy grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent rate.
   The report, however, represents an upward revision from a
preliminary estimate last month, which pegged growth at 2.2 percent.
   The department attributed the revision to a higher-than-expected
rise in personal consumption expenditures, which account for nearly
two-thirds of economic activity. They rose at an annual rate of 4
percent in the third quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of
3.5 percent.
   Also, non-farm business inventories grew faster than originally
thought. However, this could be a source of weakness in the future
if consumer demand slackens and manufacturers have to cut production
as the inventories are sold off.
   A price index tied to the GNP also proved more brisk than was
first estimated. The index, which reflects changing consumption
patterns as well as prices, rose at an annual rate of 4.7 percent,
up from the first estimate of 4.4 percent. The second quarter soared
at an even faster 5.5 percent, the highest in nearly six years.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the latest
report does not change ``the basic economic picture'' of moderate
growth and steady inflation.
   ``Inflation remains at about the second quarter rate. And, after
adjusting for the effects of the drought, the economy continues to
grow at its long-term average pace, which is 2 to 3 percent,'' he
said.
   However, the revisions to the GNP were about in line with
economists' expectations and fit in with anticipation in the market
that the Federal Reserve Board will soon move to curb inflation by
dampening growth with higher interest rates.
   Major banks on Monday raised their prime lending rate to 10.5
percent, the highest level since mid-1985. Economists expect a new
round of increases as the Fed tries to restrain growth to a
non-inflationary pace of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.
   The Fed pushed up interest rates steadily from late March through
early August. For a time, it appeared the medicine was taking hold.
A number of statistical reports showed slower growth in August and
September.
   Government numbers released over the last three weeks, however,
portray robust growth in October, the first month of the fourth
quarter.
   ``It's amazing how strong the momentum is now,'' said David
Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government
securities dealer in New York. ``... We'll be starting the seventh
year of an economic expansion and the normal peacetime expansion
lasts only three years.''
   He predicts growth will accelerate to an annual rate of about 3.5
percent in the final three months of 1988, even with the aftershocks
from the drought.
   The Commerce Department said that without the drought third
quarter growth would have been a strong 3.2 percent and second
quarter growth would have been a brisk 3.9 percent, rather than 3.0
percent. The effect of the drought in the fourth quarter is
estimated to be about double the drag in the third quarter.
   The two engines of economic growth in the first half of the year
_ exports and business investment _ played less of role in the third
quarter.
   Exports and imports both grew at an annual rate of 11.6 percent.
Because imports were growing from a larger base, however, the
nation's inflation-adjusted trade deficit as measured by the GNP
worsened slightly for the first time in a year.
   Business investment grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the
third quarter, down from 15.0 percent in the second quarter.
   James Annable, an economist with First National Bank of Chicago,
predicted that exports and investment spending will rebound, in part
because of the continued fall of the dollar, which hit a 40-year low
last week against the Japanese yen.
   A lower dollar makes American goods cheaper on overseas markets,
spurring export sales. The higher sales, in turn, stimulate spending
by manufacturers to increase productive capacity.
   However, stronger growth brings with it the danger of higher
prices as the economy strains to meet demand. Already, factories are
using more of their production capacity _ 84 percent _ than at any
time in more than eight years. With unemployment at a 14-year low of
5.3 percent, businesses are offering higher wages to attract workers.
   ``It's likely the Federal Reserve will respond by pushing up
interest rates and tightening credit. ... Banks are already
anticipating this process by raising their prime rate,'' Jones said.
   Higher interest rates discourage spending by both consumers and
businesses, thus slowing economic expansion.
   ``What the Fed is trying to do is engineer a moderation of growth
to a somewhat less inflationary pace. It's a very delicate balancing
act. The tightening so far just wasn't enough to do the job,'' Jones
said.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
at an annual rate of $4.01 trillion.
   In an accompanying report, the Commerce Department said after-tax
corporate profits rose a slight 0.2 percent in the third quarter
after soaring 8.9 percent in the second quarter. The July-September
gain was the lowest since a loss in the fourth quarter of 1987.

   The husband of a woman accused of
snatching an infant from a hospital nursery thought his wife had
just given birth and was unaware that she had faked her pregnancy,
police and prosecutors say.
   Sharon Newkirk, 36, was arraigned Monday on kidnapping charges in
the abduction of 2{-month-old Debra Lynn Moore, who was taken from a
crib at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital on Friday. Bond was set at
$300,000 and a hearing was set for Dec. 7.
   But authorities dropped charges against her husband, Robert.
   ``We're fairly well convinced he did not know his wife planned to
kidnap the baby,'' said Police Lt. John Atkinson. He said Newkirk
was released after he passed a polygraph test Monday.
   ``(Sharon Newkirk) was telling him she was pregnant all along,
that she has small babies and that she has them quick,'' Atkinson
said. ``She really built this up in his mind.''
   Mrs. Newkirk allegedly made medical appointments at the
University of Michigan Medical Center and told her husband she was
visiting an obstetrician, Atkinson said.
   Newkirk said he would stand by his wife.
   ``I don't think she knew what she was doing,'' he said. ``I
thought it was my child.''
   The Newkirks, of Howell, were arrested Saturday when they pulled
into the driveway of their home in Howell. Police said they found
the baby in their car.
   Witnesses said the Newkirks showed off the child at Cleary's Pub
in Howell about an hour after the 4{-pound child was reported
missing.
   Debra Lynn was receiving medication at the hospital for breathing
problems when she was taken. The premature infant also was hooked up
to electronic monitoring equipment and required feeding every three
hours to prevent dehydration. Her twin brother was left undisturbed
in his nearby crib.
   The baby's 17-year-old mother, Kimberly Sue Moore of Monroe,
wasn't at the hospital when her child was taken.
   The infant was returned to C.S. Mott on Saturday, and was listed
in good condition Monday.

<HEAD>Lousiana Pardon Board Withdraws Leniency Recommendation For
Ex-Fugitive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Louisiana Pardon Board today withdrew
its recommendation of leniency for a man who killed a man nearly 20
years ago and later escaped from prison to build a new life in
Tennessee.
   The withdrawal came three weeks after Henry Staggs was arrested
in Tennessee on sexual abuse charges based on allegations made by a
stepdaughter and a niece.
   During 17 years as a fugitive from Louisiana, Staggs raised a
family and operated an auto repair shop in Columbia, Tenn.
   The FBI finally tracked him down last February, and he was
returned to Louisiana.
   After a pardon board hearing in which Staggs' attorney presented
petitions signed by 2,000 Tennessee residents asking for leniency,
the five members recommended a six-month sentence.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer refused to accept the recommendation, asking
the board to reconsider.
   Before the pardon board could reconsider, Staggs was arrested in
Tennessee.
   ``Based on the current situation in Tennessee, the indictments
being of such serious nature, the board recommended that any form of
leniency be withdrawn,'' Annette Viator, attorney for the Louisiana
Corrections Department, said today.
   ``If he's found innocent, then he could apply here again for
leniency. By law, he can do that within a year of being denied,''
she said.
   Shortly after Staggs' arrest in Tennessee on the sexual abuse
charges, the niece recanted her testimony, saying Staggs had only
touched her breast and that may have been accidental.
   A grand jury received the case on Nov. 16 and is to decide
whether to indict Staggs on three counts of aggravated sexual
battery and one count of aggravated rape.
   At a Nov. 16 hearing, Staggs' 10-year-old stepdaughter testified
about several alleged sexual encounters with Staggs.
   Prosecutors also presented a tape-recording of a 90-minute
meeting Sept. 30 between Staggs and his sister, Betty Fraser, who
was equipped with a hidden microphone by the Tennessee Bureau of
Investigation. Staggs allegedly told Mrs. Fraser that some of the
allegations his stepdaughter made were accurate.
   ``She did it on her own free will,'' Staggs said on tape. ``Tell
her that whatever happened in the past, I'm sorry for. Tell her I
don't blame her. I don't hold it against her. I need psychiatric
help.''
   Staggs was being held in the Maury County, Tenn., Jail in lieu of
$250,000 bond.

<TEXT>
   The judge in Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra case
today refused to bar prosecutors from closed hearings set to begin
this week on deleting sensitive government secrets from documents to
be used as evidence.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell refused to give lawyers for
the former National Security Council aide permission to file a
motion to bar independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh from the
hearing, which is set to begin Wednesday.
   Gesell said in a brief order that barring prosecutors ``would
alter the purpose of the hearing and would result in further and
wholly unnecessary delay.''
   Defense lawyers gave no reason for their request, filed Monday.
If they had been granted permission to file the motion, they would
likely have argued that prosecutors would get an unfair preview of
their strategy if allowed to attend the hearing.
   North is charged with conspiring to divert millions of dollars in
profits from the Reagan administration's secret weapons deals with
Iran to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   The hearings were scheduled by Gesell to consider defense
objections to the deletion of sensitive material from classified
documents that Walsh wants to use as evidence against North.
   Gesell has directed North to come to the hearing prepared to say
why the material is relevant to his defense and should not be
deleted.
   The references Walsh wants to delete include names of foreign
countries and officials as well as U.S. intelligence agents
operating abroad. The government has consented to Walsh's use of the
350 documents as exhibits in a public trial provided the sensitive
references are deleted.
   Also on Monday, North replied to Walsh's request that Gesell bar
the defense from using any of 40,000 pages of classified documents
it has proposed as trial exhibits.
   Walsh contends that North listed many of the documents in his
Nov. 14 notice simply to provoke dismissal of the charges against
him, by threatening to disclose some of the nation's best-kept
secrets.
   North's lawyers countered that Walsh is making a ``frontal
assault on defendant North's fundamental Fifth and Sixth Amendment
right to present a defense.''
   No date has been set for North's trial, the first of four ordered
by Gesell for the former presidential aide and his three
co-defendants: former national security adviser John M. Poindexter
and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen.
Richard V. Secord.

<HEAD>Workers Claim Rockwell Stressed Production Over Quality In B-1
Project

<TEXT>
   Rushed production schedules pressured
workers inspecting parts for the B-1 bomber and some flawed parts
may have been used in building the aircraft, some Rockwell
International plant workers say.
   A copyright report Monday by WBNS-TV quoted workers as saying
substandard parts disappeared after being rejected by plant
inspectors. The employees said they believe those parts subsequently
were used in building the bombers to meet production schedules.
   U.S. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio,
called for inquiries as a result of the news report.
   Fred Hoffman, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said today the
Defense Department and Air Force were aware of the TV report but had
no reason to suspect faulty parts had been used in the bomber.
   ``The Air Force does not have any evidence at this time which
corroborates the assertions by former Rockwell employees that
substandard parts were used in the construction of B-1's,'' Hoffman
said.
   ``However, the Air Force is investigating or is looking into
these allegations.''
   Four B-1B bombers have crashed in the four years since the
aircraft began flying as the nation's first new long-range bomber in
more than 25 years, including three crashes in the past 14 months
and two in the past three weeks.
   Tod Sumner, identified as a B-1 inspection manager, said he was
told that if he did not reduce the number of finished parts that
were stored for inspection, he would be fired.
   WBNS said Sumner and Larry Greene, identfied as a former quality
inspector with Rockwell, worked over the Fourth of July weekend in
1986 to inspect 1,400 parts after they were threatened with
dismissal. The men were later suspended for 17 days after the Air
Force questioned the quality of inspections conducted in so short a
time, the station said.
   ``Rockwell wanted a scapegoat, fall guys, so they could say
quality problems were taken care of (and) let's go on,'' Greene said.
   Greene and Sumner met with an attorney and planned to sue the
company if they were fired, WBNS said. They ultimately were assigned
to less sensitive jobs.
   Mike Mathews, a spokesman for North American Aircraft, the
Rockwell unit that operated the Columbus plant, said Rockwell had
investigated similar claims by the two workers previously and found
no bad parts had been used.
   ``We believe similar allegations were made involving Greene and
Sumner in 1985, at which time they were thoroughly investigated and
no defective parts were found to have been delivered to the Air
Force,'' Mathews said.
   Mathews said the company would have to examine the claims in the
WBNS report before commenting on them.
   The newscast also reported that other workers said the Air Force
was more interested in verifying paperwork than in conducting
on-site parts inspections. They also said workers and management
knew in advance when inspections would be conducted.
   Last month, the General Accounting Office, Congress' watchdog
agency, released a study saying B-1Bs at Dyess Air Force Base in
west Texas were unable to fly 47 percent to 66 percent of the time
because they undergo maintenance ``a significant portion of the
time.''
   The Columbus plant manufactured the housing for the B-1's jet
engines, the forward intermediate fuselage of the plane, and what
Mathews described as a ``primary structural element'' of the
supersonic aircraft.
   Rockwell has ended operations at the plant and has delivered the
last B-1 components to its Palmdale, Calif., assembly plant, Mathews
said.

   More than 3,000 Koreans working at four
U.S. Air Force bases went on strike to protest the dismissal of 105
Korean employees, U.S. military authorities said Tuesday.
   Members of the U.S. Forces Korean Employees Union began the
strike at midnight Monday at bases in the provincial cities of Osan,
Suwon, Kwangju and Taegu, the military said.
   Korean workers provide support services at the bases.
   Air Force authorities expressed hope the striking employees would
return to work and urged union leaders to ``come together with
appropriate officials to discuss concerns.''

<HEAD>NRC Orders Inspections For Counterfeit Parts At Nuclear Plants</HEAD>

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Tuesday
it has ordered operators of all commercial nuclear power plants to
check their safety systems for counterfeit and possibly faulty
circuit breakers.
   Spokesman Frank Ingram said the order, issued Nov. 22 to the 110
plants, noted that recent inspections ``indicate a potential safety
concern.'' But he said there have been no instances where a
counterfeit or faulty breaker was blamed for an accident of any kind
at a nuclear plant.
   The order for inspections, which must be carried out by March 1,
followed an NRC investigation into allegations that four Southern
California firms had sold counterfeit breakers to nuclear plants.
   Pacific Gas & Electric reported in July that it had found 30
counterfeit breakers in its inventory at the Diablo Canyon nuclear
plant near San Luis Obispo.
   Southern California Edison Co. found in the same month that it
had bought 16 potentially counterfeit breakers for its San Onofre
plant, 55 miles south of Los Angeles.
   The NRC said in the bulletin that the inspections are necessary
``to provide reasonable assurance that nuclear power plants can be
operated without undue risk to the public health and safety.''
   The NRC has found ``numerous failures'' of certain types of
circuit breakers during preliminary commission-supervised tests, the
bulletin said.
   If a potentially counterfeit breaker is found already installed _
and it cannot be immediately tested _ the utility must submit ``an
analysis justifying continued operation,'' the bulletin said.
   The Los Angeles Times reported that the inspection plan was
criticized in a memorandum attached to the bulletin by Underwriters
Laboratory, a nonprofit testing agency that certifies circuit
breakers.
   ``The test program is not adequate to provide assurance that the
tested ... circuit breakers would be suitable for their intended
purpose,'' the laboratory said.
   The NRC responded by saying that it ``considers the test program
to provide a reasonable assurance of performance requirements and
characteristics most important to ensuring reactor safety.''
   The NRC has told utilities that more than 50 companies may be
counterfeiting circuit breakers and other electrical components.

   The pilot of a wrecked Delta jetliner told
federal officials looking into last summer's crash that his crew's
flight preparations were adequate, although they may have bent some
of the rules.
   Delta Capt. Larry Davis, 48, was among the first witnesses to
testify in the four-day public hearing before National
Transportation Safety Board investigators, which began today at an
Irving hotel and drew some 200 people.
   The Delta Air Lines Boeing 727 crashed Aug. 31 on takeoff from
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, killing 14 people.
Ninety-four people survived.
   Davis said the plane had no apparent problems, although a fuel
gauge didn't work. But the captain said he and his crew followed
written procedures to compensate for the faulty gauge.
   ``The flight was normal. No problem at all to Dallas-Fort Worth
Airport'' from Jackson, Miss., Davis said. The plane was bound for
Salt Lake City.
   NTSB board of inquiry technical panelist Jeff Gorney, an
aerospace engineer, questioned Davis' handling of pre-flight
preparations, including his failure to initiate required checklists
and failure to call out the completion of every checklist.
   Gorney also said a flight attendant was allowed into the cockpit
when the plane was waiting to take off.
   Davis admitted the seeming deviations from written regulations,
but he still stressed that he thought he and the crew had complied
with airline instructions.
   For instance, the Delta veteran of 23 years said he had used hand
signals instead of calling out completion of each checklist and made
a required takeoff briefing at the gate instead of doing it as the
plane was on the runway.
   ``I like to get as much done as possible before we get into the
position of getting rushed,'' said Davis.
   He admitted that allowing a flight attendant into the cockpit was
against a policy declaring that the cockpit be a ``sterile area''
once it has left the gate. But he noted that the plane was ``waiting
in a line of traffic, moving up a space at a time.''
   Davis was questioned for 63 minutes before NTSB officials
declared a break. He was told he would be asked to recount what he
had done the previous day, how he had slept the night before the
crash, and details of events up to the time of the crash.
   Thirteen people died as the plane split open and the fuselage
exploded in flames just off a runway. One man died later of injuries
suffered as he tried to make his way back onto the burning plane in
an unsuccessful attempt to save his trapped wife. In addition to
Davis, the co-pilot and flight engineer survived and were expected
to testify.
   Jim Burnett, chairman of the board of inquiry, stressed in his
opening statements that no conclusions are to be made by the panel
during its hearing, but that officials were only gathering
information for a final report to be released in six months.
   But officials of the pilots' union said they believe
investigators may have decided on the first day of their
investigation that the crew was to blame.
   ``If you do a quick and dirty investigation, the verdict is going
to be quick and dirty _ pilot error,'' Jim Gray, Delta spokesman for
the Air Line Pilots Association, said Monday at a news conference.
   The union argues the plane may have had a malfunction called a
``split-flap configuration,'' in which the wing flaps stick in
opposing positions _ one extended, one retracted _ robbing the plane
of power and lift.
   Gray said judging by the list of witnesses and exhibits the NTSB
scheduled for the hearing, it appeared as though the federal board
already has pinpointed a cause and was looking at such matters as
Delta's flight safety program.
   NTSB spokesman Mike Benson responded that the pilots association
and other involved parties had all agreed to the witness list two
weeks ago.

<HEAD>Government Gets Tough, Calling in Army to Ease Transport Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers in army trucks rolled into the Paris region
Tuesday to help transport hundreds of thousands of suburban
commuters stranded by a transit strike the government called ``union
guerrilla warfare.''
   The strike called by the communist-led General Confederation of
Labor paralyzed two of four lines on the regional express network
and was spreading to city subway and bus services.
   On Monday night, the French government ordered more than 350
military trucks and 1,000 soldiers to supplement private companies
called in to move passengers.
   The military contingent, from Dijon and other areas, was expected
to be in operation for morning rush hour Wednesday, with 250 trucks
at the suburban terminals of the affected lines, according to
Prefect Olivier Philip, governor of the Ile de France region.
   It was expected to take up to 48 hours for all 365 military
vehicles to be operational.
   ``Deterioration of public services forces the government to
assume its responsibilities,'' President Francois Mitterrand said.
``That is what the government has done, and done well, notably in
calling in the army.''
   The transit strike is one of a string of work stoppages plaguing
France for more than a month. Public sector employees ranging from
postal workers to nurses, ambulance drivers and even funeral parlor
employees have been striking sporadically for increased wages and
other benefits.
   Socialist Premier Michel Rocard, in power for six months, has
remained firm in the face of demands, continuing the tight spending
policies in force since 1983.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre ordered strikers' wages
suspended and punishment of those engaged in what he said were
illegal acts.
   He said some strikers blocked buses in their terminals, flattened
tires and sabotaged engines.
   This amounted to ``a sort of union guerrilla warfare of
harassment'' in which ``hundreds of thousands of users were being
taken hostage,'' the minister said.
   Blocked terminals, maintenance depots and lack of material were
forcing a reduction in city bus and Metro service, with buses
running at about 60 percent capacity at rush hour Tuesday and one
Metro line shut down.
   The transit authority decided over the weekend to close down the
two suburban train lines starting Monday, saying safety could no
longer be assured because of the strikers, whose strength is
concentrated in the train maintenance forces.
   Henri Krasucki, secretary-general of the labor federation,
denounced what he called government tactics of ``repression,
sanctions and intimidation'' which he said will only ``increase the
fighting spirit'' of the strikers.
   Workers, with an average monthly salary of about $1,100, are
demanding a $170 monthly increase plus improved safety measures. The
transit authority most recently proposed increases of about $25 plus
bonuses ranging from about $17 to $100.
   Opposition politicians have criticized Rocard, saying he has
failed to define a policy to deal with public sector grievances.
Mitterrand, re-elected to a seven-year term in May, had made social
peace a main campaign pledge.
   The strike action fanned by the labor federation is widely
regarded as a Communist Party effort to undermine the government and
strengthen its own hand for municipal elections in March. Party
officials deny they are using social discontent for political
benefit, and Krasucki said the idea was ``completely stupid.''
   Job grievances have affected many sectors this fall.
   Striking postal workers left Paris without mail service for three
weeks earlier this month, and mail strikes continue in Lyon, Amiens
and Clermont-Ferrand.
   Marseille has been hit with strikes by train and bus drivers and
social security workers, who are refusing to work in several
provincial cities.
   Other job actions are being carried out at nuclear plants, in
Paris pharmacies and at the Louvre Museum, where guards protesting a
change in work hours have been off the job for more than a week.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci next
week will visit four Arab states that have provided limited support
for American forces in the Persian Gulf, U.S. officials say.
   A stop aboard U.S. warships in the gulf also is on the itinerary
for what was expected to be Carlucci's last tour before the Reagan
administration leaves office in January, said the officials, who
asked not to be identified.
   The Defense Department said Carlucci would discuss a variety of
regional issues with officials in Oman, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait. These presumably would include the scaling back of U.S.
forces following the Iraq-Iran cease-fire.
   Carlucci is including the gulf on a 10-day trip that begins with
defense meetings in Paris and at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
   Gulf-based sources, insisting on anonymity, said Carlucci's visit
was primarily in response to an invitation from Oman's defense
minister, Mutassim Bin Hamoud Busaidi. The other stops were added
for diplomatic reasons, they said.
   All four Arab states, though nominally neutral in the Iraq-Iran
war, have made facilities of one kind or another available to U.S.
forces since mid-1987, when the escalating conflict prompted a major
buildup of American and other foreign naval units in the gulf.
   Despite the Aug. 20 cease-fire, in effect ending eight years of
Iraq-Iran hostilities, 11 Kuwait-owned oil tankers reflagged by the
United States last year for protection still sail under the Stars
and Stripes.
   The sources said Carlucci's acceptance of the Omani invitation
reflected U.S. interest in nurturing a relationship that gained
strength during the war, yet remains more secretive than U.S. ties
with any other gulf Arab state.
   The Omanis permit U.S. warships to refuel at a naval depot on the
Arabian Sea. They have served three times in the past 15 months as
diplomatic go-betweens for the repatriation of Iranians captured or
rescued at sea by U.S. forces.
   The Omanis, who share control of the Strait of Hormuz, the
strategic gateway to the gulf, with Iran, have longstanding military
ties with Britain. However, they also are the only gulf state to
participate in annual ``Bright Star'' military maneuvers with the
United States, Egypt, Somalia and Sudan.
   Pentagon officials say the United States will reduce its fleet if
the Iraq-Iran truce continues to hold, but have given no timetable.
   Already trimmed by two ships from 27 to 25, it remains the
largest of six foreign navies in the region.
   The gulf-based squadron of 15 returned to full strength Sunday
when the amphibious assault ship USS Raleigh arrived after a month's
delay for repairs. It carries a 400-man U.S. Marine combat force.
   European navies are withdrawing more rapidly, with Belgium's last
minesweeper recently departed, the Netherlands' last leaving Dec. 2
and Italy's five warships heading home before Dec. 31.

<TEXT>
   A computer failure that cost the state up to
$700,000 in lost lottery ticket sales is being investigated by
specialists from the firm that set up the troubled ``Lotto 6-49''
terminals, officials said.
   Experts from GTECH, based in Providence, R.I., were to inspect
the software that caused the 3-year-old lottery's worst computer
breakdown.
   The computer crash came as the state was ending an investigation
of problems with GTECH, which has been fined $1.7 million for
computer mishaps since the company got the ``Lotto 6-49'' contract
in October 1986. A report of the investigation is due Friday, said
lottery director Chon Gutierrez.
   The computer failure Saturday night affected up to 4,700 of the
state lottery's 7,200 ``Lotto 6-49'' terminals.
   A backup system restored service to all but 120 terminals about
12 minutes later, lottery spokeswoman Susan Kossack said. ``What is
unusual is that all of the terminals on the backup system did not
come back up,'' she said.
   In spite of the outage, three players picked all six numbers
correctly to win $2 million each.
   GTECH, which operates Lotto under a $220 million five-year
contract with the state, is subject to fines for each minute of
computer lapse that occurs up to eight hours before the Wednesday
and Saturday drawings.
   GTECH faces a fine of ``close to $200,000'' as a result of the
failure, lottery computer director Joanne Hoffman told the Los
Angeles Times.
   However, Leonard G. Morrissey, GTECH's senior vice president,
told the Rocky Mountain News in Denver that his company probably
would have to pay less than $1,000 in fines for Saturday's
breakdown. GTECH is installing the system for Colorado's lottery,
which is scheduled to begin Jan. 24.
   In a related development, the San Francisco Chronicle and the
Times reported Tuesday that GTECH has been investigated by auditors
from the lottery and the state controller's office.
   The two-month investigation was prompted by allegations from two
lottery telecommunications systems analysts who contended that GTECH
concealed computer malfunctions to avoid paying the state damages
for lost Lotto revenue.
   Lew Ritter, chief of security for the state lottery, called the
allegations ``just a bunch of baloney.'' He predicted that GTECH
will be cleared of wrongdoing.
   Cynthia Nebergall, GTECH's general counsel, declined to discuss
the allegations, citing company policy.
   The two complaining workers, who have been transferred from their
jobs pending the investigation, allege that lottery officials are
covering up for GTECH.

   Gov. Robert D. Orr is expected to wait at
least two weeks before selecting someone to take over Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle's Senate seat, according to the
governor's press secretary.
   ``He does not want to wait until the last minute, but he
understands he has the entire month (of December),'' Dollyne
Pettingill said after meeting with Orr Monday.
   Earlier this month, Orr had said his appointee could benefit from
attending Senate Republican caucus elections this week, fueling
speculation that the replacement would be named quickly.
   But Ms. Pettingill said the governor has not narrowed a list of
candidates.
   ``I think that once that takes place, he will have a better idea
on the timing of the announcement. But do not look for it any time
soon,'' she said.
   Orr, a Republican, must name a replacement for Quayle before Orr
leaves office on Jan. 9 or he will lose the right to Gov.-elect Evan
Bayh, a Democrat.
   The appointee also can gain a few days of seniority over newly
elected senators if Orr makes his selection before the new Senate is
sworn in Jan. 3.
   Quayle will be sworn in as vice president Jan. 20.

<HEAD>FAA Wants Airlines to Modify Takeoff Alarms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration today
proposed modifications in the takeoff alarm systems on virtually all
U.S. commercial jetliners to guard against electrical failures,
officials said.
   The directive, which would apply to more than 3,700 commercial
jets, would require installation of a warning light in the cockpit
to warn pilots when the takeoff alarm system loses electrical power,
the agency said.
   The alarm is designed to alert a pilot that his plane, and
especially control devices such as wing flaps, is not in the proper
configuration for a takeoff.
   Airlines have until February to comment on the proposal and then
a year to comply, although some air carriers are expected to make
the changes sooner, officials said.
   FAA officials said the modifications are not expected to
interrupt normal airline service because they likely will be done
during routine maintenance and would probably take only about 20
hours of work per plane.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said installation of the cockpit light,
which must be clearly visible to all flight crew members, is
estimated to cost about $1,050 per aircraft.
   The crash on Aug. 16, 1987 of Northwest Airlines Flight 255
during a takeoff from Detroit's Metro International Airport was
blamed on the failure of the flight crew to set the plane's wing
flaps properly for takeoff. The crashed killed 156 people.
   Investigators also are examining the possibility of an improper
flap setting in the crash of a Delta Air Lines jet at Dallas last
August in which 14 of the 108 people aboard were killed. There was
no sounding of the takeoff alarm system in that aircraft either.
   The Detroit crash involved a McDonnell Douglas MD-80, while the
crash in Texas involved a Boeing 727.
   According the FAA, the directive will cover virtually all
commercial jetliners including those produced by the Boeing Co.,
McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and Airbus Industrie, the European
aircraft manufacturing consortium.
   In some aircraft, the modification may already have been made,
one source said. The FAA-directed correction is aimed at warning the
flight crew of an electrical short in the alarm system as some
investigators have suggested likely occurred in the Northwest
jetliner that crashed in Detroit.
   The National Transportation Safety Board last May concluded that
Northwest Flight 255 crashed because the pilots did not set the wing
flaps to the proper takeoff position, preventing the MD-80 from
gaining proper lift.
   The NTSB determined in the investigation that the alarm, which
governed the takeoff flaps, did not sound because of an interruption
of electrical power. Investigators could not determine conclusively
what caused the power interruption, the safety board said.
   At the time, however, the Air Line Pilots Association maintained
that there was a possible inherent problem with the alarm systems
that made them susceptible to electrical problems. The NTSB said it
could not determine whether the electrical short was due to such a
defect, but also did not rule out the possibility that the flight
crew might have pulled a circuit breaker to prevent nuisance alarms.

   A graying group of civil rights warriors, some
black and some Jewish, gathered to take a look back at their
coalition against segregation and to acknowledge things are no
longer the same between them.
   ``We are not bosom buddies in the way we were in the intense days
of the '60s,'' said Courtland Cox, a black man from Washington who
was among about 70 participants in Monday's sessions of a conference
aimed at chronicling black-Jewish cooperation.
   Cox and several other black speakers emphasized the potential for
reuniting the groups, which have sometimes clashed over methods of
integration, the rights of Palestinians under the Jewish government
of Israel and alleged anti-Semitism by some blacks.
   ``There was some ambivalence where the movement was split, but
now we can heal those splits,'' said James Farmer of Fredericksburg,
Va., a black who helped found the Congress of Racial Equality.
   Farmer recalled his trip to Mississippi in 1964 to investigate
the disappearances of three civil rights workers. Two of them,
Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, were Jewish, and Farmer said
Mississippi authorities referred to them as ``Jew boys.''
   The two, along with a black man, James Chaney, were later found
dead.
   Even earlier, Farmer said, Jews became natural allies of blacks
because of anti-Semitism fanned by the Ku Klux Klan and the lynching
of Jewish businessman Leo Frank in Georgia in 1915.
   ``Jewish Americans came to realize that their enemies were the
enemies of blacks, too,'' he said.
   Conference participants today held a memorial service for the
movement's martyrs and others who have died in the intervening years.
   Carolyn Goodman of New York, mother of Andrew Goodman, read a
brief quotation from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and Ben Chaney
of New York, brother of James Chaney, read from ``The Diary of Anne
Frank'' during the service.
   They joined hands as the group concluded the service by singing,
``We Shall Overcome.''
   Most speakers at the sessions found no fault with self-interest
as a motive for Jewish aid to the civil rights movement.
   But one black participant, Lolis Eli of New Orleans, said he
found Jews no more helpful than other whites except for the fear of
their own persecution.
   ``I think that many of the Jews, almost in gratitude, feel that
blacks have taken a lot of the punishment that Jews would have to
take if blacks were not present,'' Eli said.
   Rabbi Israel Dresner said his religious beliefs propelled him
into the ``freedom rides'' and four arrests in the South.
   ``I came because that's what Judaism teaches ... that we are all
part of the human family,'' said Dresner, of Wayne, N.J. ``I came
because of Jewish history. I came because of the Holocaust. I came
because of slavery in Egypt.''
   For William Taylor of Washington, a former staff attorney for the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the process worked in reverse.
   ``A large part of my identity as a Jew comes out of that struggle
of blacks and Jews together,'' Taylor said.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, and several other black
speakers praised their Jewish colleagues and downplayed the
importance of their motives.
   ``I don't want to argue about intent, I want to argue about
effect,'' Hooks said.
   On Monday evening, the group went to the crypt of Martin Luther
King Jr. at the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change.
   ``Somewhere along the way, we sort of lost contact,'' Lloyd
Cutler, the King Center's executive vice president, said. He called
for a renewed black-Jewish coalition to battle threats such as
racist ``skinhead'' groups.
   The conference, titled ``The Black-Jewish Alliance: Reunion and
Renewal,'' is sponsored by the King and Carter centers, the
Washington-based Marjorie J. Kovler Institute for Black-Jewish
Relations and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.

   Britain's two most powerful women have been thrust
into a controversy over reports that Queen Elizabeth II will soon
receive an invitation to visit Moscow, and that Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher doesn't want her to go.
   The notion of a Soviet visit is all speculation. But it
higcate nature of Britain's constitutional monarchy,
and the headlines it produces fuel a public perception of the queen
and prime minister as two women who don't get along.
   The flurry dates back to the ahlights the delinnouncement two weeks
ago that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will visit Buckingham Palace
en route home from Washington.
   The next day the Evening Standard reported from Moscow that the
queen was likely to be invited for her first visit ever to the
Soviet Union.
   The idea sent a shudder through royal-watching circles, where it
was quickly noted that the Russian royal family, murdered by
Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution, were the queen's ancestors.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis will travel to Washington
on Friday to meet with President-elect George Bush for their first
face-to-face encounter since the election that Dukakis lost to Bush,
the governor's aides said today.
   Dukakis, the defeated Democratic presidential candidate, will
meet with Bush at the vice president's residence for a session
beginning at 2 p.m., according to a statement from Dukakis's press
office.
   Dukakis spokesman Steve Crawford said the length of the meeting
is ``open-ended'' and there was no specific agenda yet.
   Bush extended the invitation to get together with the governor
two weeks ago. Dukakis immediately accepted, and their staffs have
been working since then on a time and place.
   ``He asked to meet with me (and) I am pleased to do that,''
Dukakis said last week.
   The governor suggested then that he was concerned about reports
that the Bush administration may try to balance the budget by
cutting Medicare, Medicaid and other social programs.
   But when asked if he intended to give Bush some advice, Dukakis
said: ``Well, I offered a good deal of advice during the campaign.
He is aware of that.''

   A 49-year-old man is suspected of deserting at
least four brides after cleaning out their bank accounts, federal
authorities say.
   Victor Barr, who has no known address, was arraigned Monday and
jailed without bail on charges of bank fraud and causing Carol Kelly
of Pontiac to travel with him to Las Vegas in April for marriage
under false pretenses.
   Authorities contend Barr lured Kelly and three others to the
altar by promising money from an inheritance, then lived off their
credit cards and cash, repaying them with checks written on a closed
account.
   Kelly, a 46-year-old administrative assistant, said Barr told her
he was going to inherit $5 million and promised her $200,000. Barr
took $14,000 from her, Kelly said.
   ``Maybe I'm very stupid, I don't know,'' she said. ``But he has a
very upbeat aggressive manner and that's how he convinces people.''
   If convicted, Barr could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison
and fined up to $500,000.

   An animal rights activist accused of
planting a bomb at a surgical instruments company that experiments
on live dogs pleaded innocent today to charges of attempted murder,
possession of explosives and manufacturing a bomb.
   Fran Stephanie Trutt, 33, of New York City didn't speak during
her brief appearance in Stamford Superior Court except to say
``definitely not guilty.''
   Superior Court Judge Martin Nigro denied a motion by her public
defender to lower bail from $500,000 to $60,000, and she remains in
custody.
   Animals rights groups have disavowed any connection to Trutt, who
was arrested on Nov. 11 near U.S. Surgical Corp.'s Norwalk
headquarters.
   She was accused of hiding a powerful, radio-controlled pipe bomb
packed with roofing nails in bushes near the vacant parking space of
company Chairman Leon Hirsch.
   Three more bombs were discovered in her New York apartment after
her arrest.
   In a prison interview, Trutt said she didn't intend to kill
anyone with the bomb, but that she wanted to scare the company into
ending its practice of using live dogs to demonstrate its surgical
staples.
   Defense lawyer Monte Radler said today that Trutt planned to meet
with a private attorney and asked for a continuance. Nigro scheduled
a pre-trial hearing for Dec. 13.
   In asking that Trutt's bail be reduced, Radler noted that she has
no criminal record and that it should be obvious from her statements
that she plans to return to court to defend herself.
   Assistant State's Attorney Bruce Hudock said a $500,000 bond is
necessary because the state believes that Trutt is a danger to the
community.

   Senate Democrats today elected George Mitchell
as their majority leader and Mitchell said he was ready to ``move
forward'' with George Bush's White House on the federal deficit and
other major issues.
   The senator from Maine was elected in a closed meeting by a
unanimous voice vote after first narrowly missing a majority in his
race against Sens. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii and Bennett Johnston of
Louisiana.
   The federal deficit, health care, day care and the environment
were top priorities, said Mitchell, who planned to meet Wednesday
with Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, re-elected by Republicans as their
leader earlier in the day.
   Asked if he would cooperate with Bush, Mitchell said, ``We hope
to move forward on a broad range of issues.''
   ``The Democrats await with interest and enthusiasm the proposals
of the next administration,'' he said.
   Mitchell, appointed to the Senate in 1980, elected in 1982 and
re-elected earlier this month, will succeed Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
who decided to step down as majority leader to become chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Byrd, who was also elected as the Senate's President Pro Tempore,
announced the vote to reporters. He handed his gavel to Mitchell
before television cameras, then stepped back as his successor moved
to the microphones to take questions.
   Byrd will become chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Mitchell garnered 27 votes on the first ballot, one short of a
majority among the 55 Democrats in the new Senate. Inouye and
Johnston each received 14.
   Johnston then moved that Mitchell be approved unanimously; Inouye
seconded the motion. After the vote, Johnston said:
   ``The best man won. George Mitchell will be a great majority
leader.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston of California was re-elected as the party's
whip, defeating Sen. Wendell Ford of Kentucky. There was no recorded
vote.
   Although the least senior of the three candidates, Mitchell is
considered a strong spokesman for the party. A New England liberal,
the former federal prosecutor and judge has a reputation as a
skilled, thoughtful legislator.
   Mitchell, 55, is a liberal like Inouye but less tradition-bound.
He appealed to Democrats seeking someone who would appear less
ideological but still could act as a strong public speaker for the
party.
   Mitchell will bring to the post of majority leader a far
different style than Byrd, who was Democratic leader for a decade.
   Byrd's tenure was marked by his mastery and manipulation of the
Senate rules and his distinctive personality. Although very
secretive about his legislative dealings, Byrd would display before
the Senate his memory of poetry and history, both of which he would
recite at length in the chamber.
   Mitchell is less of a Senate institution and far more open
personally than Byrd. Although more liberal, Democratic colleagues
describe him as a consensus builder and not an ideologue.
   And, while relations between Byrd and Dole often seemed strained,
there is potential for a strong working relationship between
Mitchell and Dole. The two men have served together since 1981 on
the Senate Finance Committee and always speak well of each other.
   Inouye, 64, pitched himself as the most experienced of the three.
His liberal voting record is in line with traditional Democrats.
Johnston, 56, and the most conservative of the three, cited his
Southern roots and parliamentary skill.
   The three candidates, besides representing different regions,
offered different perspectives for the Democrats.
   Aside from those broad themes, the candidates appealed to their
colleagues on very personal issues such as demands for choice
committee assignments and changes in the Senate rules and schedule.
   Dole, the Kansas senator who recently has been meeting with Bush
to settle their differences, was re-elected in a voice vote that
re-installed three Republican officers who faced no opposition, said
Walt Riker, Dole's spokesman.
   Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., was re-elected minority whip; Bill
Armstrong, R-Colo., was returned as chairman of the Republican
Policy Committee, and Thad Cochran, R-Miss., was kept on as GOP
secretary, Riker said.
   The GOP conference chairman, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., defeated
challenger Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, by 28-17 to retain his post,
Riker said. Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., defeated Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., on a vote of 28-17 to head the National Republican
Senatorial Committee.
   While the camps of all three contenders for the majority leader's
position voiced optimism before the vote, senators said Monday that
the outcome was uncertain. Each of the contestants was continually
polling the 55-member Democratic majority, but the answers received
might be more positive than the results in today's secret ballot.

<TEXT>
   Residents used to climbing down a steep
bank to dip muddy water out a stream have won a 15-year battle to
have clean water pumped into their southwestern Mississippi town.
   The community of 40 residents 65 miles southwest of Jackson will
receive a $105,500 Community Development Block Grant and a $50,500
loan from the Farmers Home Administration to hook up with the water
system in nearby Pattison, U.S. Rep. Mike Espy announced this week.
   He said workers hope to supply water within four months to Blue
Hill, where only three residents could afford wells. Many residents
have relied on rain and creek water for bathing and on friends in
neighboring communities for drinking water.
   ``We didn't have much other choice,'' said Jake Savage, 65, who
has sometimes driven his truck to the creek two or three times a day
to fill containers with water. ``Most of the others had to do the
same thing.''
   The project will assure a safe drinking water supply for Blue
Hill residents, said Joe Brown, chief of the state Bureau of
Environmental Health.
   ``Any time you can bring running water into a community and fresh
water directly to the houses, you improve living standards and help
in protecting the health'' of people living there, he said.
   ``This is the cry of rural America,'' Espy told the residents and
officials gathered at the creek bank Monday. ``Rural America, at
least since 1981, hasn't been high on the agenda of the people who
control the purse strings.''
   Espy added similar water problems exist in communities in three
other Mississippi counties.
   The grant could not have come soon enough for residents here.
   ``We need it bad,'' said Jerry Savage, Jake Savage's son, as he
knelt over the creek. ``We've been going there to get water for 15
years.''
   James Cole, who has a well, said he shared water with residents
who lived across the creek until a wooden bridge over the creek
washed out a year ago.
   ``We've been fighting for it for 15 years. Our people've just
been put off,'' Cole said.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today
the strong opposition to his decision to bar a visit by PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat to the United States shows that people are forgetting
what a threat international terrorism is.
   Under questioning at a groundbreaking ceremony for a State
Department annex, Shultz said he was sorry about the breadth of the
opposition to his decision but that he will stick by it.
   In addition to Arab countries, Great Britain, West Germany and
Italy, among other allies, all have criticized Shultz's decision.
   ``To some extent the opposition suggests how important it was to
decide what was decided and to make it so clear what the basis
was,'' Shultz said.
   ``The basis (was) our concern about terrorism and I am afraid
that it's too easy for people to forget what an important problem
that is and what a threat it is to civilized society.''

   With the New Age Telephone Book, you can reach
waaaaaaaay out and touch someone.
   The directory lists psychics, healers, numerologists, gurus,
channelers, ghost hunters and almost anyone else who may appeal to
followers of New Age philosophies.
   A real estate agent, for instance, offers clients ``your own
place in the universe.'' A ``gentle dentist'' promises free wine and
stereo headphones. A medical clinic tells AIDS patients that their
best years are yet to come.
   ``We want to be the book that you pick up first if you have this
particular consciousness,'' said managing editor Caryn Goldberg.
``After all, the Pacific Bell Yellow Pages doesn't exactly have a
category for rebirthers.''
   Jeanne Cordova, the directory's publisher, and Goldberg, who also
publish gay and lesbian directories, printed 50,000 copies for
shipment mainly to stores catering to New Age clientele, where it is
distributed free.
   Ms. Cordova said that at first the New Age Telephone Book was
difficult to sell to advertisers. Even those in the New Age business
felt that customers would be naturally drawn to them.
   The New Age Telephone Book, put together earlier this year,
enters its next life soon with a second edition.

   Its official name is the Ronald Reagan Center for
High Energy Physics, but a newspaper contest has yielded a
friendlier, Texas-style moniker for the ``super collider'' _ Super
Clyde.
   ``It's easy to say, and still, to the ear, it sounds like Super
C'lider,'' said Jewel P. Clark, 72, of Garland, whose winning entry
was among more than 1,000 suggestions received by The Dallas Morning
News.
   Ms. Clark's prizes include a year's supply of Atomic Fireballs
candy, a junior scientist microscope and two passes to a science
museum.
   The $4.4 billion underground atom smasher _ the world's biggest
and most powerful _ will be built in Waxahachie, south of here. The
53-mile tunnel will take eight years to build.
   An entrant who got special notice was David Thomas of Waxahachie,
who suggested the super collider be named ``The Cellar'' so ``it can
be advertised as the home of the Texas Rangers and Dallas Cowboys.''
   ``Will the employees be known as `The Atom's Family'?'' Thomas
further mused.
   Receiving honorable mention were the names Armadillotron, The Big
Bang Thang, Big Texelerator, Proton-B-Que and Waxasmashie.
   Roger Burke of Irving submitted an entry that captured the
immensity of the project: Supercolliderfragilisticexpialidocious.

   Las Vegas likes its privacy and Los Angeles
would rather you write than call if a survey of unlisted phone
numbers is any indication.
   Las Vegas ranked No. 1 in the nation with 60 percent of its phone
numbers unlisted, while about 56 percent of people with numbers in
Los Angeles County do not list them in phone directories, according
to Survey Sampling Inc., a Connecticut company that sells phone
numbers to market research companies.
   In Los Angeles, the 56 percent figure was a 4 percent increase
from two years ago.
   ``The rate of unlistedness is definitely jumping, especially in
the top unlisted markets,'' said John Lamb of Survey Sampling.
``Younger people, ages 18 to 30, are tending not to list their phone
numbers. Our suspicion is that they feel it keeps telemarketers from
getting to them.''
   Not listing a number won't deter all phone solicitors, however.
Lamb noted many companies use computers that call every number in
sequence, listed or not.
   California is the leader when it comes to residents who don't
want their phone numbers listed. Ten of the top 20 unlisted cities
in the nation are in the Golden State, with Oakland, Fresno, San
Jose and Sacramento all in the top 10.
   Other communities with a high share of unlisted phone numbers are
Jersey City, N.J.; Newark, N.J.; Bergen-Passaic, N.J.; El Paso,
Texas; Houston, and Chicago.

   A bus carrying senior citizens on a junket
to Atlantic City's casinos today flipped onto its side as it headed
south on the Garden State Parkway, and at least 46 people were
injured, authorities said.
   The bus was carrying about 49 passengers _ senior citizens from
Brooklyn, N.Y. _ when it overturned about 11:30 a.m., said parkway
communications officer Mike Cannon. The injured were taken to four
hospitals.
   Fourteen people were treated at Monmouth Medical Center in Long
Branch for what spokeswoman Jane Hollander described as mostly
slight injuries, including cuts, bruises and chest pains.
   Eleven people were taken to Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank,
some with head and back injuries, cuts and bruises, said spokeswoman
Sandra Nardone. None of the injuries appeared life-threatening, she
said.
   Ten people were taken to Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune,
mostly with cuts, bruises and back injuries, said spokeswoman Marie
Koppa.
   Eleven people were taken to Bayshore Community Hospital in
Holmdel, some with dizzy spells and back and shoulder injuries, said
spokeswoman Lisa O'Donnell.
   Authorities identified the bus as belonging to Leisure Lines of
Mahwah. The company referred all calls to police.
   The bus came to rest on the passenger-door side, partially
blocking the left lane of the highway. As rescue squads from at
least five towns and soldiers from Fort Monmouth reached the scene,
passengers sat dazed on the grassy shoulder, some covered with
blankets.
   The accident closed the express lanes of the heavily traveled
parkway, which traverses the state from north to south.

   John Tower has been talked about as a potential
defense secretary for the better part of a decade, so it's no
surprise that he's now considered the front-runner for that post in
the new Bush administration.
   But it isn't coming easily, with almost daily reports of
negotiations over conditions President-elect George Bush wants to
set before appointing his fellow Texan.
   No one doubts the military expertise of the 63-year-old Tower. He
was chairman of the Armed Services Committee when he retired from
the Senate in 1985 after 24 years. And he served as an arms
negotiator for President Reagan after that.
   By all accounts, despite apparent opposition from some Bush
aides, Tower is the leading choice to head the Pentagon for the new
president. However, he was mentioned as a possible defense secretary
for President Reagan _ a development that never occurred.
   A source close to the Bush transition office said Tuesday that a
decision on Tower could come by Wednesday.
   The source, who spoke only on condition he not be named, said
Bush likes Tower and thinks he would do a good job at the Pentagon.
But some Bush advisers have raised objections, partly because they
do not have a high regard for a number of people who have worked for
Tower and might have an inside track for top Pentagon jobs should he
be named. The negotiations supposedly concern who would control
which appointments on Tower's Pentagon team.
   Tower himself has said little in public in recent days. His aides
say each day, when asked: No call from the White House yet.
   Tower has worked for Bush before. In fact, he was one of Bush's
key emissaries to the platform committee at the Republican National
Convention last summer _ essentially speaking for Bush in the
negotiations.
   In the Senate, Tower championed Reagan's military buildup and
increase in defense spending, but if he gets the Pentagon job he'll
become Bush's point man.
   And Bush, in publicly describing the role of his Defense
secretary, said last week that his nominee must be willing ``to take
a fresh, tough look in these times of budgetary crunch at the
Defense Department.''
   Also, the president-elect's choice for national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft suggested cuts of at least $300 billion from the
Reagan administration's military spending plans for 1990 to 1994.
The suggestions were included in a report presented to Bush by
former Presidents Ford and Carter.
   On other military subjects, Tower:
   _Favors Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as
Star Wars, and is a leading supporter of the MX missile. He has
called them ``important elements in negotiating'' with the Soviet
Union.
   _Despite supporting the MX, opposes Reagan's plan for fixed
deployment of the weapon, preferring the Carter administration's
plan to move the missile deceptively.
   _Opposes the unratified 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
with the Soviet Union, a pact that Tower believes does not reduce
nuclear capabilities.
   Shortly after retiring from the Senate, Tower was named a U.S.
arms control negotiator in Geneva where he concentrated on reduction
of long-range nuclear weapons.
   He quit that post after 14 months for what U.S. officials said
privately were family reasons and because he believed the job lacked
excitement.
   In November 1986, Reagan chose Tower to head a commission
investigating the Iran-Contra affair. In its final report issued in
February 1987, the panel blamed the arms-for-hostages dealing in
part on Reagan's laid-back management style. It had little to say
about any possible Bush involvement.
   Tower gained national attention in 1960 when he lost to
Democratic Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, who ran for both re-election and
the vice presidency. Johnson resigned his Senate seat and Tower
defeated the appointed replacement, Democrat William A. Blakley, in
a special election, by a mere 8,000-vote margin.
   The son of a Methodist minister, Tower, a one-time Democrat,
former radio announcer and insurance salesman, was the first
Republican elected by Texas voters to the U.S. Senate. Two GOP
senators in the post-Civil War period had been named by the Texas
Legislature.
   In the earlier campaign against Johnson, the 5-foot-6 Tower won
over voters with his self-deprecating line, ``My name is Tower _ but
you can see that I don't.''
   In his last re-election campaign, Tower refused to shake his
opponent's hand when they met by accident, and he described his
rival as a ``little Lord Fauntleroy.''
   Tower recently was divorced from his second wife, Lilla Burt
Cummings. The messy legal battle included accusations that Tower
committed ``marital misconduct.''

   Tom Theobald thought the radio contest was too
easy: Answer a question about the first day of autumn and win ``keys
to a brand-new Porsche.''
   Two months later, Mike McDonald, the WLS-AM disc jockey who made
the offer, has been fired, and Theobald is still waiting for a
Porsche. He hasn't even gotten the keys, he says.
   ``I got through and I gave him the right answer,'' Theobald, a
21-year-old biology student at William and Mary College in Virginia,
said Monday.
   After receiving a letter from Theobald's lawyer, who also is his
brother, station managers fired McDonald. But they still say the
whole thing was obviously a joke and they have no intention of
giving away a Porsche.
   McDonald offered the keys to the first caller who could explain
``what was special'' about the day, Sept. 22. Theobald, listening to
the Chicago station from his home in Williamsburg, Va., was the
first person to call and say it was the first day of autumn.
   ``You win the keys to the car,'' McDonald said, according to a
transcript read by WLS operations manager Richard Lippincott. When
Theobald asked if it was a joke, McDonald said it wasn't, adding:
``I have absolutely no idea where the car is, but you get the keys.''
   About a month later, Theobald mentioned the incident to his
brother Ed, a Chicago attorney.
   Ed Theobald said radio contests are regulated by the Federal
Communications Commission, which requires that stations deliver what
they promise. ``It was definitely my brother's understanding that he
would win the car,'' he said Monday.
   When WLS received a letter from Tom Theobald on Nov. 14 inquiring
about the car, McDonald was suspended. He was fired three days
later, Lippincott said.
   McDonald's telephone number could not be obtained through
directory information, and the station would not provide it.
   The station doesn't plan to give away a car.
   ``I don't think we owe the guy a Porsche,'' Lippincott said.
``It's obvious from the transcript that he understood he won the
keys and not the car.''
   Meanwhile, Tom Theobald will drive his Datsun, with 140,000 miles
on it.

<HEAD>Report Says Meat Inspection System Broken Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The system set up by the government to
assure that meat produced in the United States is free of dangerous
chemicals has broken down, U.S. Department of Agriculture
investigators reported.
   The results of an investigation by the USDA Office of Inspector
General were contained in a report circulated among USDA officials.
The findings were reported Tuesday by the Des Moines Register.
   The report said testing at meat plants was not done randomly,
allowing violators to avoid detection. When chemical contamination
was found, action was seldom taken to prevent sale of the tainted
meat, the report said.
   Federal officials were unable in most cases to trace animals with
illegal chemical or pesticide residues to producers and seldom took
follow-up samples to determine if the violations were continuing,
the report said.
   The report said ``some adulterated products were allowed to enter
commerce.''
   Because the department did not consult the Environmental
Protection Agency on what residue levels are safe, there is no
assurance pesticides are being monitored ``at levels necessary to
protect the public health,'' the report said.
   The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service is responsible for
ensuring that government-inspected meat and poultry are wholesome.
   Inspectors are to randomly collect meat and poultry samples at
plants, and if high levels of residue are detected, movement of the
meat to market is supposed to be controlled and the producers are to
be identified.
   The report said the FSIS is hampered by laws that allow testing
only at slaughter plants. It recommended laws allowing testing at
production and sales sites.
   The report said samples were gathered at some plants at routine
and predictable times. ``Such trends could allow plants to
manipulate slaughter schedules to prevent detection of known or
suspected violations,'' the report said.

   Two explosions rocked a highway
construction site early today, killing six firefighters battling
suspicious fires at the scene, officials said. The force of the
blasts shattered windows 10 miles away.
   The blasts left two large craters _ 30 to 40 feet wide and six or
seven feet deep. The charred wreckage of one firetruck was near one
of the craters, but ``the other firetruck ... there is absolutely no
evidence that it was ever there,'' said Fire Department spokesman
Harold Knabe.
   A seventh firefighter, who was near the site with a department
car, was injured and taken to the hospital, said Knabe.
   The first blast, shortly after 4 a.m., involved an estimated
30,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate, Knabe said. About 20 minutes
later there was a second explosion that involved about 15,000 pounds
of ammonium nitrate.
   Residents of a two-mile area around the blast site were
evacuated. One resident was hospitalized in good condition after
complaining of chest pains, and five other residents went to
Research Medical Center but were released after treatment or
observation.
   Knabe said a first fire was spotted in a pickup truck while two
guards looked for someone they thought they had seen in the area. A
second fire broke out in a trailer that contained explosives, and it
spread to a second trailer.
   ``We're assuming that someone did set both fires because both of
them did occur when both security people were away from the area,''
Knabe said. The guards were not hurt, he said.
   Police Sgt. Gregory Mills said he could not estimate the size of
the two trailers that exploded because ``there ain't nothing there
anymore.''
   Firefighters and a bomb squad moved into the area of the blast
around daybreak to look for other explosives. Authorities said the
victims' bodies had been recovered.
   The Fire Department called the deaths the department's worst loss
since record-keeping started in 1899. The most deaths among
firefighters previously, five, occurred in a gasoline storage tank
explosion in August 1959.
   The explosions occurred at a construction site on the southern
edge of Kansas City, about 1{ miles northwest of Bannister Mall, one
of the area's busiest shopping malls. A number of quarries are
located adjacent to the highway construction site.
   ``We have a very serious situation. Windows are busted out all
over the area. Kansas City police asked us to help cordon off the
area,'' said Tom Taylor of suburban Raytown, a member of an
emergency rescue squad.
   The ammonium nitrate was stored at the site and was used to blast
the quarry and clear rock for the highway construction, officials
said.
   Authorities said windows were blown out of homes and businesses
over at least a 10-mile area around the site.
   Roger Ware, manager of a service station in the neighborhood,
said the first blast ``lifted my cash register about 3 inches off
the counter. It knocked a lot of merchandise over or off my
shelves.''
   About a dozen windows were broken at Marion Laboratories Inc.'s
distribution and computer center near the blast site.
   Larry Wheeler, a company spokesman, said five people working in
the building at the time of the explosion escaped injury. He said
the 75 to 100 people who work there were told to stay home for the
day.
   The nearby John Deere Co. also sustained damaged, and workers
there were told not to report to work today.
   Power was knocked out in the area for about one hour.
   Several residents said the explosions almost lifted them out of
their beds.
   Knabe said the first two fire crews at the scene called for a
battalion chief. Firefighters were battling the blaze in the first
trailer when the battalion chief arrived and the first explosion
occurred.
   ``As his driver got out of the car, the explosion knocked him
several feet, blew out the window in the chief's car and threw it
back on the chief. The chief managed to get the radio and call for
additional help,'' Knabe said.
   He said the explosion spread fire to the second trailer, which
exploded 20 minutes later.
   Mills estimated that the battalion chief's car, about 150 feet
from the burning trailer, was knocked back about 25 feet, but he was
not injured.
   People in the area complained of natural gas leaks after the
explosions, said Hal Hudson, a spokesman for KPL Gas Service Co.
Hudson said utility crews have not been able to get into the area of
the explosion to determine the extent of damage to the company's
facilities.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A divided Supreme Court, in a decision some
members said is unnecessarily sweeping, ruled Tuesday the rights of
criminal defendants are not violated when police unintentionally
fail to preserve potentially vital evidence.
   The court also said the Constitution does not require police to
conduct state-of-the-art tests in examining evidence.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices reinstated an Arizona man's
conviction in the kidnaping and sodomizing of a 10-year-old boy.
   The justices reversed a lower court ruling that the man's rights
were violated because police failed to preserve and analyze properly
semen samples from the child's body and clothing _ evidence which,
in theory, could have exonerated the defendant.
   In another decision, the high court reinforced the right of the
poor to have a lawyer's help in appealing convictions. The justices,
voting 8-1, said an Ohio appeals court improperly allowed an
attorney to withdraw from representing a convicted rapist and robber
without explaining in detail why he believed an appeal was frivolous.
   In the Arizona case, an appeals court threw out the conviction
and 10-year prison sentence of Larry Youngblood. He was convicted of
kidnapping a boy on Oct. 29, 1983 from a church carnival in the
Tucson area. Police said the boy was driven to a house, raped four
times during a 90-minute ordeal and then released.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in his opinion for the high
court Tuesday, said Youngblood did not prove that police
deliberately failed to preserve evidence.
   ``Unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of
the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not
constitute a denial of due process of law,'' Rehnquist said.
   ``Requiring a defendant to show bad faith on the part of police
both limits the extent of the police's obligation to preserve
evidence to reasonable bounds and confines it to ... those cases in
which police themselves ... indicate that the evidence could form a
basis for exonerating the defendant,'' he said.
   Rehnquist said the obligation of authorities to preserve evidence
is not as great as their duty to turn over to defendants all
existing evidence, including material that could help acquit the
accused.
   Also, he continued, the Constitution does not require police to
use the best available technology to test the reliability of
evidence.
   Comparing the case to one in which police fail to use a
Breathalyzer to determine if a motorist was intoxicated, he added,
``Police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any particular
tests.''
   But Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in a dissenting opinion, said
police ``ineptitude'' deprived Youngblood of his right to a fair
trial.
   ``The Constitution requires that criminal defendants be provided
with a fair trial, not merely a good faith try at a fair trial,'' he
said. ``By what may have been nothing more than police ineptitude,
(Youngblood) was denied the opportunity to present a full defense.''
   Blackmun also said there was no need for the court to decide
whether police must use the cutting edge of technology in analyzing
evidence.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Justice John Paul Stevens joined the majority in voting to
reinstate Youngblood's conviction. But Stevens said the court went
too far in holding that criminal defendants must prove bad faith by
police when crucial evidence is lost or destroyed.
   Youngblood, convicted of child molesting, sexual assault and
kidnapping, was identified as the assailant from police photographs
shown to the boy.
   Laboratory specialists found traces of semen on the boy and also
in clothing he was wearing.
   It was not until a year later that the semen was tested to
determine blood typing of the assailant. But no blood group
substances were found.
   The semen sample taken from the boy's body was refrigerated. The
clothing, which might have contained a larger quantity of semen, was
not.
   Youngblood was determined to be what is known as a secretor, with
blood type A. That means that his blood group could be determined
from his semen.
   The absence of blood group substances in the semen taken from the
victim suggested that the boy's attacker either was a non-secretor
or that the samples were too small to determine blood type.
   There also was testimony that technologically advanced tests to
determine blood grouping were not performed on the semen samples.
   An Arizona appeals court threw out Youngblood's conviction on
grounds that had state-of-the-art tests been performed and had the
best technology been used to preserve the evidence, Youngblood might
have been found innocent.

<TEXT>
   Miracle Recreation Equipment Co. has agreed to
pay a $100,000 civil penalty and to make corrections on several of
the public playground equipment products it sells, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission announced Tuesday.
   The monetary payment settled charges that Miracle failed to
promptly report defects in its Bounce-Around Whirl and Buckaroo
Whirl playground devices, which were subject to a repair program in
1983. Those products had been associated with 70 injuries to the
legs of children, the commission said.
   The new agreement calls for corrections for other products,
including the Flying Animal Swing, which has been blamed for one
death and seven injuries to children struck by the swing, the
commission said.
   Also to be corrected are the Lifetime Whirl, Slashproof Swing
Set, Arch Swing and Therapeutic Whirl, which have been associated
with 50 injuries, according to the safety agency.
   In announcing the settlement, the commission noted that Miracle
has denied that any of its products are defective or that they pose
a substantial risk to children. The company has also denied
violating product reporting rules. In addition, the agency noted
that it has made no formal finding of violations by the company.
   However, the company agreed to notify its customer list of the
settlement and make any repairs necessary.
   Anyone needing more information can contact Miracle at
1-800-523-4202 or the safety commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<HEAD>Debate On Palestinians Postponed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs with Palestinian debate postponed. No time
has been set for introduction of the resolution. Picks up 4th graf
pvs ``Saturday's decision...'' </NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly today delayed its
annual debate on the Palestinian problem, the first step toward
convening a special session outside New York to hear PLO chief
Yasser Arafat.
   General Assembly President Dante Caputo told the assembly he had
received a request from Arab nations to postpone the debate
scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Dec. 6.
   Since there were no objections, Caputo said, the request was
granted. Caputo, the Argentine foreign minister, said earlier the
assembly would move swiftly to provide Arafat an alternative forum.
The United States on Saturday denied Arafat an entry visa.
   Diplomats have said that unless the United States reverses its
decision, the U.N. debate on Palestine will shift to Geneva so
Arafat can address the General Assembly. No new date has been set
for the debate.
   Arab representatives today drafted a resolution expressing regret
over the U.S. action and saying the United States violated its legal
obligations by denying Arafat a visa.
   The resolution was to be introduced later today before a U.N.
committee and may go to the General Assembly late today or Wednesday.
   Saturday's decision by Secretary of State George P. Shultz to bar
Arafat from the country on grounds he was an ``accessory'' to acts
of terrorism against Americans has been widely criticized by dozens
of countries, including the Arab world and such staunch U.S. allies
as Britain, Canada and Australia.
   Only Israel backed the U.S. decision.
   In Washington, the State Department said Monday the U.S. decision
to deny the visa was ``firm and final.''
   A senior U.N. official said on condition of anonymity that if the
United States still refuses to grant Arafat a visa, another
resolution probably will called this week for moving the assembly to
Geneva.
   Arab diplomats say they have enough votes, a simple majority in
the 159-member body, to shift the assembly to where Arafat would be
able to speak.
   U.N. legal counsel Carl-August Fleischhauer told a U.N. committee
the U.S. decision violates the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement
that requires the host country to grant visas to people invited by
the United Nations.
   ``The agreement does not contain a reservation of the right to
bar the entry of those who represent, in the view of the host
country, a threat to its sovereignty and security,'' Fleischhauer
said.
   Patricia Byrne, alternate U.S. representative, said the U.S.
government disagreed with Fleischhauer's interpretation, but she did
not elaborate.
   Many nations in the world body said the U.S. action countered
what they described as the Palestine Liberation Organization's move
toward modernization with its declaration of Palestinian
independence Nov. 15 that also implicitely recognized Israel.
   The U.N. Committee on Relations with the Host Country heard
numerous speakers assail the U.S. decision to ban Arafat.
   Iraqi Ambassdador Ismat Kittani told the committee: ``The
decision by Washington is a slap in the face, of equal measure, to
every member of this organization.''
   The Soviet Union and China, and U.S. allies France, Spain, Sweden
and Norway, among others, said Arafat should be allowed to speak.
   Arafat called the U.S. move ``a sheer violation of the
international law and the U.N. charter'' and said Washington was
ignoring international backing for the independent state of
Palestine, proclaimed this month by the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the shift to
Geneva was unnecessary because other PLO spokesmen in New York could
speak instead of Arafat.
   ``Probably no other country in the world has worked as hard at
the peace process as the United States has,'' Redman said.
   Presidential spokesman Marln Fitzwater said, ``We were making no
kind of statement about the United Nations, but about Yasser Arafat
and terrorism.''

   State officials say the fatal collapse of
a ride at the Broward County Fair may lead to new safety
regulations, but they may not get much help from a consultant
studying the wreckage.
   One of six arms on the ``Monster'' ride broke at a paint-covered
crack on Nov. 23, dropping four baskets carrying passengers 10 feet
to the ground. A 17-year-old girl died and six other people were
injured.
   State Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner, who oversees the
state's six-person Bureau of Fairs and Expositions, is studying the
accident with an eye toward improving state inspections of carnival
rides.
   Conner's senior executive assistant, Larry Shackelford, said
Conner will make recommendations to the Legislature during its
January committee meetings covering staffing, training and
inspection procedure.
   Meanwhile, a consultant studying the broken ride said he doesn't
plan to make his findings public.
   Jeffrey Tennant, dean of graduate studies and research at Florida
Atlantic University here, said Monday he is not working for the
state but for a company that insures the operator of the Broward
County Fair midway.
   His findings ``may only become available in a legal proceeding,''
Tennant said.
   After the accident, Wally Rich, director of the state's Bureau of
Fairs and Expositions, said he was counting on answers from
Tennant's metallurgical and X-ray tests.
   ``We're hoping he can tell us the speed of the ride and what
caused the fracture to become a complete break,'' Rich said last
week. ``We also want to determine how long the fracture has been
there and if there are fractures of the other (five) arms.''
   But Tennant said if any legal problems over the teen-ager's death
are settled out of court, it is possible the metal test results may
never be known.

   A ski-masked gunman walked into a bagel
restaurant and opened fire today, killing two people and critically
wounding a third, then escaped from the shop safely, police said.
   Albuquerque Police Sgt. Ruth Lowe said a man walked into the
Bagel Lovers restaurant about 9 a.m. and started shooting. A witness
told police that the gunman had paced back and forth in front of the
shop before he went in, she said.
   One man was dead at the scene, she said. The other, a 63-year-old
man, died at University of New Mexico Hospital with a gunshot wound
to the head, said hospital spokesman Bob Hlady.
   The woman was in critical condition at the hospital, also wounded
in the head.
   ``We don't have any motive at all,'' Lowe said. ``We have a very
slight description.''
   Police said they were looking for a white man in his early 30s
about 5-foot-5 to 6-foot tall. They said the man was wearing a ski
mask.

cannot reschedule three sold-out concerts at the Tacoma Dome,
officials said.
   Stadium director Jay Green said this week he was ``very, very
disappointed,'' although he knew rescheduling ``would be an uphill
battle.''
   More than 70,000 tickets at $23.50 each had been sold for the
performances Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 and 2 which were canceled after
Jackson's agent said he was ill.
   More recently, Los Angeles Sports Arena officials said they were
told Jackson had ``swollen vocal chords'' when he canceled his shows

   A statement issued by an agency representing Jackson said the
singer ``sincerely hopes to perform in Tacoma in the near future.''

<HEAD>Presidential Council Rejects Bill to Enforce Racist Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential council Tuesday
rejected a proposed bill that would have tightened enforcement of
residential segregation laws.
   Anti-apartheid leaders welcomed the move but urged the government
to scrap all discriminatory laws, including measures extreme-right
local officials are using to resegregate public facilities.
   Last week, the Conservative Party-controlled town council in
Boksburg voted to bar blacks from most municipal facilities. On
Tuesday, Conservative councilors in Brakpan, another industrial town
near Johannesburg, similarly decided to ban blacks from public
parks, toilets and sports facilities.
   The President's Council, dominated by the governing National
Party, sent the residential segregation bill back to President P.W.
Botha with a recommendation it be redrafted to ease penalties and
decriminalize some offenses related to the Group Areas Act. The act,
a cornerstone of South Africa's legalized race segregation called
apartheid, prevents people of one race from living in areas
designated for each of the other race groups.
   The bill was referred to the council because of a deadlock in
Parliament: it was passed by the National Party-dominated white
chamber but rejected by the Asian and mixed-race chambers.
   South Africa's majority 26 million blacks are not represented in
Parliament and have no vote in national affairs.
   The proposal to impose sharply increased fines on violators of
the Group Areas Act had been widely criticized abroad and by
anti-apartheid activists in South Africa. Even before it reached the
President's Council, the bill was softened by removal of a proposal
for mandatory evictions of people living illegally outside their
designated race zones.
   Peter Marais, a mixed-race council member, likened the bill to
Nazi persecution of the Jews.
   Several anti-apartheid council members said discriminatory laws
caused the current controversy in Boksburg.
   ``What is happening in Boksburg must be a lesson to all of us,''
said Marais. ``Don't leave matches lying around for children to play
with.''
   The actions in Boksburg have been criticized by government
officials, white businessmen and sports organizations, as well as
local blacks who have begun to boycott the industrial town's
white-owned businesses.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha warned it could cause tougher
sanctions and urged people to oppose discrimination based ``merely
on the color of one's skin.''
   Businessmen and several national sports organizaions have warned
they will shun Boksburg because of the negative publicity.
   Some liberals suggested the outcry was hypocritical because
Boksburg council is exercising discriminatory powers allowed under
the National Party-approved Separate Amenities Act and employed
elsewhere, including in the capital city, Pretoria.
   ``Mr. Botha seems to be missing the point,'' said Jannie Momberg,
co-chairman of the anti-apartheid Independent Party. ``What the
Conservative Party is doing is legal ... It's National Party laws
that have given South Africa a bad name.''

Republics</HEAD>

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev bowed to criticism
of his constitutional reforms Tuesday, saying he will accept tighter
limits on presidential power and try to accommodate republics
clamoring for more autonomy.
   Gorbachev, acknowledging the political give-and-take forming in
the freer atmosphere he has fostered, told the Supreme Soviet, or
parliament:
   ``Our own socialist system of `checks and balances' is taking
shape in this country, designed to protect society from any
violations of socialist legality at the highest state level.''
   The Supreme Soviet is considering during its three-day session a
package of almost 120 articles of legislation first published five
weeks ago that Gorbachev says are the first major step toward a
political system based on law, not central dictate.
   But the draft laws faced stiff criticism that they actually
stengthen the presidency, which Gorbachev assumed on Oct. 1, against
the legislature, and strengthen Moscow's power against that of the
15 Soviet republics.
   The unprecedented criticism of the proposed legislation was
highlighted by the Estonian republic's Nov. 16 ``declaration of
sovereignty'' over all internal affairs and demand to review all new
Soviet legislation. Several Supreme Soviet deputies, including two
top officials from the Baltic republics, registered dissatisfaction
Tuesday with elements of the reform.
   Arnold Ruutel, the Estonian president, told reporters that
Surpreme Soviet deputies only received copies of the amended
proposals on Tuesday. They have not been published.
   But Gorbachev, detailing some of the changes to the 1,500 Supreme
Soviet members, said, ``It is obvious that some of the provisions of
the bills were not formulated precisely enough and cuased quite a
few critical remarks in the course of discussions.''
   ``The draft now gives the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet the right to
repeal decrees and decisions by its Presidium, and orders by the
Supreme Soviet president,'' Gorbachev said.
   That was implied in the Soviet Constitution, which requires
Supreme Soviet confirmation of directives of the Presidium, the
highest executive body on which Gorbachev serves as chairman.
   But the Supreme Soviet almost never has challenged any such
directive, and the proposed constitutional amendments said nothing
about Supreme Soviet review.
   Gorbachev's reforms call for the formation next year of a
Congress of People's Deputies, a 2,250-member legislative body that
will include representation from the Communist Party, trade and
creative unions, and social organizations as well as geographical
legislative districts. The Congress will choose a smaller Supreme
Soviet, which is to become more active.
   He said the Congress would have power to recall any official it
appoints, including the president.
   The Supreme Soviet would have the powers of budget oversight and
review of the actions of government ministries. ``This right will
definitely be used regularly in the new conditions,'' he said.
   It was not immediately clear whether Gorbachev was giving up his
proposal to strengthen the president by giving his the chairmanship
of the Defense Council and responsibility for foreign policy.
   In order to further strengthen the system of checks and balances,
Gorbachev said a constitutional review commission would be formed,
and that judges would be given considerably more independence.
   To meet complaints from small republics the amendments now give
all 15 republics stronger representation in one house of the Supreme
Soviet, the Soviet of Nationalities.
   Gorbachev, who led the Presidium on Saturday in rejecting
Estonia's challenge, stressed the economic unity of the Soviet Union.
   But a specific criticism of Estonia originally included in a
summary of Gorbachev's remarks distributed by the Tass news agency
did not appear in the final version, and he struck a conciliatory
note.
   Gorbachev proposed creating a special commission to settle the
question of division of powers between the central government and
the republics.
   Soviet Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov, in a news conference,
told reporters that a section allowing central authorities to
declare a state of emergency and call in soldiers to keep order had
been amended to assure the republics any such operation would be
temporary, and that they would be consulted.
   ``We are not approaching the constitution and the republics as
something that has been set once and forever. There will be changes
and amendments,'' he said.
   But leaders of two Baltic republics still objected.
   Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov said direct representation of
social and political organizations in the Congress of People's
Deputies could result in one person holding several seats in the the
congress.
   Another Baltic republic president, Vitautas Astrauskas of
Lithuania, called for a new constitution limiting the central
government to national issues.
   Gorbachev's ideology chief, Vadim A. Medvedev told a news
conference that he believed the Estonian measures were ``adopted
spontaneously under public sentiment and emotion that for a certain
time got the upper hand in the republic.''
   ``I'm not inclined to agree they are an adequate reflection of
public opinion in that republic,'' he said.

   A Japanese man called an international
terrorist by prosecutors was found guilty Tuesday of weapons charges
and of transporting homemade bombs with the intent to commit
sabotage.
   U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner convicted Yu Kikumura in a
non-jury trial after the 36-year-old defendant admitted to the
government's charges in an agreement worked out with prosecutors.
   ``There is no contest and there is no alternative,'' Lechner
said. ``I find the defendant Yu Kikumura guilty of each count of the
indictment.''
   Lechner set sentencing for Jan. 23. Kikumura faces up to 100
years in prison.
   Under the agreement, Kikumura admitted to the charges but
retained his right to appeal pre-trial rulings. If the pre-trial
rulings, which bear on the admissibility of evidence against him,
are overturned, his conviction could be thrown out.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said outside court that
Kikumura had come to this country ``to kill people.''
   ``This man is an international terrorist who sneaked into the
United States using a skillfully forged passport,'' he said. ``He's
someone who would have killed if he had not been stopped.''
   Alito would say little about Kikumura's target, but that more
information might emerge at sentencing.
   ``We're talking about buildings in which there are people,'' he
said.
   The government has tied Kikumura to the terrorist Japanese Red
Army and has said it is investigating his connections in the United
States.
   Alito noted that Kikumura was caught several days before the
bombing of a U.S.O. club in Naples, Italy, and the anniversary of
the U.S. raid on Libya. A day later, the finance ministers of seven
major industrial nations ended a meeting in Washington.
   Court documents showed Kikumura traveled about 7,000 miles around
the country after arriving five weeks before his arrest. He acquired
equipment to make the bombs _ three fire extinguisher casings
containing lead shot and gun powder _ on the trip.
   Kikumura's lawyers, William Kunstler and Ronald Kuby, had said
Monday in court that they could not defeat the evidence and would
seek to have the charges thrown out on appeal.
   Their announcement came on the first day of trial and moments
after Lechner rebuffed a last-ditch effort to have the indictment
dismissed because of the routine recording of Kikumura's calls to
his attorneys from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York
City.
   Kikumura has been at the federal lockup since shortly after his
arrest April 12 at a New Jersey Turnpike rest area in Ridgefield.
   Kikumura was charged with one count of transporting explosives
interstate without a permit; one count of transporting explosives
with intent to kill, injure or damage property; one count of
possession of firearms by an alien; three counts of possessing
unregistered firearms; three counts of possessing firearms without
serial numbers; and three counts of using false travel documents.
   Kunstler and Kuby said they would appeal Lechner's refusal to
find a state trooper's search of Kikumura's car unconstitutional and
thus suppress the evidence. They said they also will seek to trim
the number of counts in the indictment and to dismiss the case
because of the prison phone recordings.
   The arresting trooper said at an October hearing that the bombs
were in plain view in Kikumura's car and that Kikumura acted
suspiciously. Kikumura said the bombs were in the trunk, that he was
not acting suspiciously and that he never gave permission to search
his car.
   Lechner said he found the trooper more credible. He did not
mention the witness testimony of a gas station attendant who
supported Kikumura's version.
   Kunstler said he never asked his client what he was doing in the
United States.

<TEXT>
   Bishop W. Thomas Larkin, head of the
300,000-member Roman Catholic diocese of St. Petersburg since 1979,
announced Tuesday he is retiring for health reasons.
   Larkin, 65, said his retirement had been accepted by Pope John
Paul II. Bishops must offer their resignation at age 75.
   ``When I began my tenure as bishop I fully intended to remain
until the mandatory retirement age,'' said Larkin. ``However,
although man proposes, God disposes. During the past year my health
has not been the best and I was advised to slow down.''
   He did not disclose the nature of his medical condition.
   For nine years, the Mount Morris, N.Y., native has been head of
the growing five-county Gulf Coast diocese, which has 71 parishes
and missions, more than 200 priests, nearly 400 religious sisters
and brothers, 30 schools and 12,000 students.
   Larkin, who was ordained in Syracuse, N.Y., in 1947, was named
bishop in 1979 following the death of Charles B. McLaughlin.
   He will remain bishop until a successor is named by the pope.

<HEAD>Economy Weathers Drought Without Major Damage So Far, But Inflation
Grows</HEAD>

   The nation's economy shrugged off the summer
drought and grew at a respectable 2.6 percent annual rate in the
July-September period, but inflation picked up, the government said
Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the performance of the gross
national product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed in
the third quarter after growing at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in
the second quarter and 3.4 percent in the first three months of the
year.
   It was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986, when
the economy grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent rate.
   However, the department said the picture was distorted by the
summer drought that hit much of the nation. Without the drought,
growth would have been 3.9 percent in the second quarter and 3.2
percent in the third quarter.
   So far, a little less than half of the $12.8 billion in drought
losses have been accounted for in the GNP. They are likely to shave
as much as 1.2 percent off the fourth quarter average.
   ``If we hadn't had a drought where cows died and grain dried up,
GNP would have been much stronger,'' said William Dunkelberg, dean
of the school of business at Temple University in Philadelphia.
``What that tells you is you have one hot economy on your hands.''
   But higher prices accompanied the growth. The government said a
price index tied to the GNP, which is adjusted to exclude the
effects of changing buying patterns, rose at an annual rate of 5.1
percent in the third quarter, edging up from 5.0 percent in the
second quarter. It was the steepest increase in more than six years.
   The growth figure and the price index represent revisions from an
advance estimate last month, when GNP was reported at a 2.2 percent
rate and the price index at 4.9 percent.
   In other economic developments:
   _The Commerce Department reported that after-tax corporate
profits in the third quarter were nearly flat. They rose only 0.2
percent to $163.1 billion, following an exceptionally large increase
of 8.9 percent a quarter earlier. It was corporate America's poorest
performance since a loss in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   _The Agriculture Department predicted food prices would rise by 3
percent to 5 percent next year, after rising about 4 percent this
year. The forecast came from James R. Donald, chairman of the
department's World Agricultural Outlook Board.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the latest
GNP report does not change ``the basic economic picture'' of
moderate growth and steady inflation.
   ``Inflation remains at about the second-quarter rate. And after
adjusting for the effects of the drought, the economy continues to
grow at its long-term average pace, which is 2 to 3 percent,'' he
said.
   However, private economists said the GNP report fits in with
expectations in financial markets that the Federal Reserve will move
soon to dampen growth, particularly if the November unemployment
report, due this Friday, shows unemployment continuing at a 14-year
low.
   Growth so far in the second half of the year ``is too fast for
stable inflation, which suggests there could be some further Fed
tightening over the next few months,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an
economist with Merrill Lynch & Co.
   Factories are operating at their highest level in more than eight
years. That, coupled with fewer people looking for jobs, could make
it difficult for manufacturers to produce enough goods to meet
demand.
   Higher interest rates are aimed at easing the demand by
discouraging spending by both consumers and businesses.
   On Monday, major banks raised their prime lending rate to 10.5
percent, the highest level since mid-1985. That will increase rates
on a variety of consumer loans. If the Fed decides to tigthen, the
prime rate could jump again before the end of the year, analysts say.
   Robert Dederick, an economist with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago,
said the mix of economic activity in the third quarter moved in the
opposite direction from what Fed policymakers want.
   Personal consumption expenditures, which account for nearly
two-thirds of economic activity, rose at an annual rate of 4
percent, compared with 3.0 percent in the second quarter.
   The two engines of economic growth in the first half of the year
_ exports and business investment _ played lesser roles.
   The nation's inflation-adjusted trade deficit as measured by the
GNP grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, the
first deterioration in a year. Business investment grew at an annual
rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter, down from 15.0 percent in
the second quarter.
   ``Consumer spending (growth) is at least double what they
(Federal Reserve members) want to see. ... That's excessive if we
want to bring down our trade deficit without kicking up inflation,''
Dederick said.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
at an annual rate of $4.01 trillion.

   A Roman Catholic bishop and six other
anti-abortion activists were released today after serving an
overnight jail sentence for an illegal protest against a women's
clinic.
   Auxiliary Bishop Austin Vaughan of the Archdiocese of New York
and the other activists began their two-day sentences in Chester
County Prison about noon Monday, said warden Thomas G. Frame.
   Officials said they counted the time the seven spent in jail
Monday and today as two days, even though the group was there for
only parts of each day. Frame's office said all were released about
10 a.m. today.
   Officials at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in
Washington said they know of no other bishop in recent years who has
served a jail term.
   ``No one here can recall a precedent,'' said Carl Eifert, an
information officer for the bishops' conference.
   The four men and three women were among 591 people arrested July
5 at the Women's Suburban Clinic in Paoli, 25 miles northwest of
Philadelphia, after they blocked clinic entrances in defiance of two
court orders. They were the first of more than 400 people scheduled
to go to prison.
   Earlier, Frame would not disclose whether the activists would
receive special treatment, saying their housing would be up to the
prison's classification committee.
   ``We will do what we feel is best for the prison and also for
them,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The prison, with a capacity of 280 inmates, is holding 494, he
said.
   District Justice Robert Mull found all the defendants guilty of
defiant trespass and fined them $10 plus $50.50 in court costs
during their trials.
   Those who refused to pay on grounds of conscience were sentenced
to two days in prison to be served 10 at a time starting every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday. One man has appealed, said court
secretary Linda Miller.
   Before appearing in court, Vaughan led a Mass at nearby St.
Norbert's Church, according to the Rev. Louis Freiberg, who
estimated about 450 to 500 people, including 15 priests, attended.
   ``They're still killing 1.5 million babies a year. ... They're
the future of our country,'' Vaughan said just before going to jail.
   Of the protesters arrested, about 405 people refused to pay the
fines, said the Pro-Life Coalition of Southeast Pennsylvania in a
statement. Ms. Miller said about 100 fines had been paid.
   Chester County District Attorney James P. MacElree II had said he
was hoping the fines would repay Tredyffrin Township the more than
$12,000 in arrest and booking costs incurred the day of the protest.
   It costs $40 per day to house each inmate, Frame said.
   The protest was organized by Operation Rescue, the Binghamton,
N.Y.-based coalition that orchestrated protests at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta and in dozens of other cities around
the nation, resulting in about 9,000 arrests this year.
   Barbara Magera, assistant to the director of Operation Rescue,
said Vaughan was arrested during an abortion protest in New York
City in May, but those charges were dismissed.
   Besides Vaughan, those entering prison Monday were Joyce Starrs
of Parkesburg; Barbara Willsher of Reading; the Rev. Richard Doron,
pastor of the non-denominational Church of the New Covenant in
Marlton, N.J.; Priscilla Gossens of Beechwood, N.J.; the Rev. Peter
Byrne of North Tarrytown, N.Y.; and Allen Billington of Glassboro,
N.J.

   A handwritten letter by Napoleon Bonaparte outlining
secret plans to invade England sold at auction Tuesday for $21,186
to a French collector.
   This rare glimpse of Napoleon's genius was the highlight of a
sale of rare books letters and manuscripts of some of France's most
famous writers.
   ``The four-page letter in Napoleon's own hand is a piece of
French history,'' said Jacques Tajan of the Ader-Picard-Tajan
auction house. ``If the plan to invade England had worked, the map
of Europe may well have been modified.''
   The buyer's identity was not revealed.
   An unusually rare eight-volume edition of the works of Moliere _
creator of French high comedy _ was sold for $322,000 to the
Bibliotheque Nationale. It is one of four first editions dating from
1673.
   The sale at the year-old Drouot auction house annex, off the
Champs Elysees, attracted military history buffs and bibliophiles.
   It offered 50 pages of letters written by the French novelist
Stendhal while he followed Napoleon's armies in 1812-13.
   In one letter, he describes the horror of the burning of Moscow
while complaining about his empty stomach, nagging toothache and the
vulgarity of his compatriots.
   One addressed to his sister, dated Oct. 4, 1812, went to the
French Archives for $35,590.
   ``We left the city, illuminated by the most beautiful fire in the
world ... The moon, I believe, shone above the fire. It was a great
spectacle, but one had to be alone to see it. This is the sad
condition which ruined for me the Russian campaign: to have been
with people who would have destroyed the Colosseum and the sea of
Naples,'' Stendhal wrote.
   All items were part of the vast collection of Jacques Guerin,
leading French collector and the man who defended the young Marcel
Proust long before ``Remembrance of Things Past'' was universally
acclaimed.
   The letter from Napoleon to Admiral Ganteaume, written Dec. 7,
1803, details three daring strategies for maneuvering 60 French
ships across the English Channel.
   ``Let us be masters of the strait for six hours and we will be
masters of the world,'' Napoleon wrote.
   The most complex of the plans involved moving one fleet to Toulon
and another toward Iceland to trick Britain's Lord Nelson into
heading for Alexandria, Egypt, while British land forces would be
tied up protecting the country's western coast against the fleet
headed for Iceland.
   None of the plans were executed because the invasion fleet was
struck repeatedly by storms and a major part engaged in a disastrous
expedition to Haiti.
   Other books from Guerin's collection included King Louis XIV's
copy of Racine's ``Esther,'' a tragedy celebrating the Sun King's
generosity, the queen's devotion and religious harmony under his
reign.
   It appealed so much to Louis that he would attend rehearsals and
follow the dialogue with his own gold- and leather-bound copy. It
sold for $59,320.

address on political reform Tuesday to the Supreme Soviet:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   No, comrades, there are no easy ways. I have had many occasions
to say that it is only by combining economic reform with political
changes, democratization and glasnost that we can fulfil both the
immediate and long-term tasks we have set ourselves.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The principal content of the first stage of the reform is
streamlining the structure of soviets, the order of the formation
and the activity of the supreme bodies of power and the electoral
system. The draft laws submitted for discussion to this session are
aimed to achieve precisely that .... The next major stage of
political transformation will be linked with the harmonization of
relations between the union and its constituent republics.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Separate mention should be made of pronouncements in favor of
broader and far-reaching changes in the Constitution of the U.S.S.R.
This applies to a radical rewording of the preamble, a new
interpretation of socialist pro socialism with democracy and
on this basis tapping the entire potential of our social system, we
have no right to forget even for one minute that socialist
democracy, like any democracy, has nothing in common with lack of
discipline, egoism and anarchy.

<HEAD>Shultz: Criticism Shows Insensitivity to Terrorism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Tuesday the strong opposition to his decision to prevent PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat from visiting the United Nations shows
widespread insensitivity to the threat of international terrorism.
   In his first public statement on the subject since his decision
to reject Arafat's request for a U.S. visa last Saturday, Shultz
said he was sorry but not surprised about the extent of the
criticism he has received.
   Speaking at a groundbreaking ceremony for a State Department
annex, Shultz said the magnitude of the opposition suggested that
international terrorism had become a secondary issue for many.
   ``The basis (for the decision was) our concern about terrorism
and I am afraid that it's too easy for people to forget what an
important problem that is and what a threat it is to civilized
society,'' he said.
   Referring to the presence of the Palestine Liberation
Organization observer mission in New York, Shultz said the
Palestinians will have no difficulty in getting their message across
to other U.N. members.
   ``We have no problem with that,'' he said.
   Since the State Department rejection of Arafat's visa request,
worldwide opposition has been virtually unanimous, ranging from Arab
countries to some of America's closest allies _ Great Britain, West
Germany and Italy.
   One common argument mentioned by allied spokesmen was that
Shultz's decision weakens the hand of Arab moderates.
   Shultz said the decision will not impair the peace process and
that he will not reconsider it.
   ``I think it was the right decision. I stick by it,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Shultz's spokesman, Charles Redman, showed little
interest in a statement by an adviser to Arafat, Bassam Abu-Sherif,
who appeared to go a long way toward meeting U.S. demands concerning
the PLO.
   Among other points, Abu-Sharif said the PLO's position is one of
``full acceptance'' of Israel and of rejection of the threat or use
of terrorism by the Palestinians.
   Redman said, ``It sounds to me like one more statement from a
Palestinian spokesman. It's always a difficult thing determining
what's authoritative and what isn't.''
   Outside the State Department, a handful of demonstrators
protested the rejection of Arafat's visa request.
   The protesters gathered across the street from the department's
main entrance, where they waved Palestinian flags, pictures of
Arafat and signs.
   In a letter to Shultz, Khalil Jahshan of the Council of
Presidents of National Arab-American Organizations called ``absurd''
the decision to refuse a visa to Arafat on national security grounds.
   ``Although we disagree with your decision, we honestly believe
that it is never too late to correct it,'' Jahshan wrote to Shultz.

   Syrian troops arrested nearly 350
pro-Iranian gunmen in unprecedented house-to-house sweeps through
Beirut's Moslem sector, officials said Tuesday.
   The cleanup operation aimed at quelling bloody clashes that began
Thursday between rival Shiite Moslem militiamen and left 40 people
dead and 87 wounded, according to police count.
   Reporters said residents in Khandak Ghamik, West Beirut, looked
stunned as Syrian soldiers staged a midmorning house-to-house search.
   Children and Shiite women, covered from head to ankle in black
chador robes, stood back in fright as the Syrians tramped through
their apartments, reporters said.
   A Syrian source speaking on condition of anonymity said under
Syrian sponsorship, Amal and Hezbollah have worked out a plan to
enforce security in the southern slums.
   It would be carried out soon under Syrian supervision, he said.
   Last week's violence marked the first time in five months that
Syrian-backed Amal and pro-Iranian Hezbollah militiamen fought in
Syrian-controlled districts of the city.
   The five-day confrontation began after four senior Hezbollah
officers escaped a car-bomb assassination attempt in east Lebanon's
Syrian-patrolled Bekaa Valley.
   Lt. Col. Amir Talleh, the Syrian officer supervising the house
raids, told The Associated Press the arrests started Sunday in a
wide-ranging operation to include Beirut's southern slums ``once
west Beirut is completely cleaned.''
   Most of the 14 foreign hostages held by pro-Iranian Lebanese
groups are believed to be kept in the city's southern districts.
   Talleh said his troops took away three truckloads of Soviet-made
assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, ammunition and
bullet-proof vests from a Hezbollah office.
   It was shut down and guarded by 120 Syrian troops. Thirty Syrian
soldiers were posted at an Amal office where Syrian soldiers
confiscated similar weapons, he said.
   Talleh refused to give a breakdown of arrests or say where the
gunmen are being held.
   But a Lebanese police spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said almost all those arrested belong to Hezbollah or
``Party of God'' and will be handed over to the Iranian Embassy
after questioning.
   Amal militiamen evacuated areas being searched by Syrian troops
and went home, he said.
   Mohammed Obeid, a spokesman for Amal, Arabic for ``hope'', said
only two militia members were arrested and they were freed Tuesday
after a 24-hour detention.
   A 12,000-strong Syrian peacekeeping force marched into south
Beirut in February 1987 and west Beirut in May 1988 to end fighting
like last week's.
   In May, more than 300 people were killed and another 1,000
wounded in a bloody 19-day confrontation that left Hezbollah in
control of south Beirut.
   Four months later, Amal's three top commanders were killed in an
ambush in south Beirut. Amal blamed Hezbollah.
   Syria was Iran's main ally in the eight-year gulf war with Iraq.
But in Lebanon, Syrian control of eastern and northern areas of the
country along with south and west Beirut, frequently is challenged
by the Hezbollah faction.

<HEAD>EPA Seeks Public Comment on Banning Auto Use in Los Angeles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday
asked the public to comment on the ``cruel dilemma'' of whether it
really is required to shut down Los Angeles auto use to meet clean
air standards, as some interpretations of the law seem to require.
   Such an action would be catastrophic, the agency said.
   Though framed in terms of Los Angeles, the legal issue could some
day be applied to many of the 107 cities and rural counties that do
not meet federal air pollution standards.
   The agency is under court order to promulgate an air pollution
control plan for the Los Angeles area, by far the dirtiest of the
107 and home to one American in 18.
   Los Angeles fails to meet federal pollution standards for ozone
and carbon monoxide, and it is the only area not meeting standards
for nitrogen oxides.
   In recent years, peak ozone concentrations have been almost three
times the standard, which typically is exceeded on 145 occasions
annually. No other city has peaks more than 75 percent above the
standard or more than 35 violations per year.
   Ozone, which damages the lungs in high concentrations, is formed
in sunlight by the reaction of nitrogen oxides, a combustion
product, with certain hydrocarbon compounds such as gasoline vapor
or solvents. The South Coast Air Quality Management District has
estimated that an 80 percent to 90 percent reduction in hydrocarbon
emissions, half of which come from transportation fuels, would be
needed to meet the ozone standard in the Los Angeles area.
   After several postponements, all cities were supposed to meet the
standards by Dec. 31, 1987 _ but Congress has never been able to
decide what happens next.
   EPA has announced, but not formally adopted, plans generally
requiring 3 percent annual reductions in emissions of the relevant
pollutants beyond whatever reductions result from federal programs
such as new auto standards.
   Though EPA is involved in several court cases, Los Angeles is the
only area where EPA is under orders to fulfill the legal mandate to
impose its own control plan where it has found local plans
inadequate.
   Tuesday's 142-page notice asked what compliance date an EPA plan
should adopt.
   EPA tried before, in 1973, to order drastic cutbacks in emissions
in Los Angeles, but in 1977, Congress required new control plans to
show attainment generally in three years to five years. For Los
Angeles now, ``A plan aimed at attaining these standards in five
years would have to ban the sale or use of fossil fuels for cars and
trucks, airplanes, boats and trains,'' EPA's announcement said.
   Such a plan ``would necessarily prohibit almost all (hydrocarbon)
emissions from manufacturing activities, and ban all products with
(hydrocarbon) emissions _ for example paints, waxes, pesticides,
auto anti-freeze, cleaning products, lubricants and suntan lotions.''
   ``It would be impossible for most people to commute to work and
for most forms of commerce to continue. ... It is evident that a
short-term (federal plan) would have catastrophic consequences'' and
could be impossible to enforce, EPA said.
   EPA clearly preferred the alternative of embracing the ambitious
plan now being developed by the South Coast district aimed at
compliance by 2007, when unspecified technological advances could
make almost all cars in the area powered by electricity. It asked
for comment on the feasibility of adopting ``backstop'' federal
measures to take effect if particular parts of the state plan fell
by the wayside.
   The agency said it would consider the public comments in
conjunction with its judgments on the South Coast plan, expected to
be formally submitted to the agency next spring.
   EPA published its dilemma on the same day the American Lung
Association issued a strongly critical report of the agency's
handling of state plans.
   The association said local affiliates examined state plans for
nine metropolitan areas _ Hartford, Conn., Los Angeles, Houston,
Philadelphia, Washington, St. Louis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Baltimore
and Chicago.
   The affiliates reported significant failure to carry out promised
control measures, widespread failure of EPA to meet deadlines for
decisions, lax operation of auto pollution inspections, use of
out-of-date data and computer models and frequent double counting of
emissions reductions.

<HEAD>Dissidents Demand Chun Be Tried For Corruption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissidents called Tuesday for former
President Chun Doo-hwan to stand trial for corruption and human
rights abuses, and they urged other political groups to support
demands for a special tribunal.
   President Roh Tae-woo was studying plans to purge the government.
He was expected to fire as many as 11 ministers linked to Chun to
try to defuse public anger and present an unsullied administration.
   Dissident leaders accused the government of a cover up, charging
Roh and his colleagues were implicated in past abuses associated
with Chun.
   ``The Struggle Committee for the Arrest of Chun,'' an alliance of
dissident groups, announced a meeting Dec. 5 of political parties
and social groups to seek special legislation to investigate and try
Chun.
   The main opposition parties, which have been calling for
appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Chun and his
wife, Lee Soon-ja, did not react immediately to the dissidents' call.
   But top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung Monday had repeated his
resistance to jailing Chun because he said he is against political
retribution.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went into rural exile at a Buddhist monastery last week after
apologizing to the nation for abuses under his seven-year
authoritarian rule.
   The furor has dominated South Korean politics with opposition
groups demanding a full accounting. The National Assembly has been
conducting public hearings into the Chun government and findings
have further fueled public anger.
   Dissidents have little public support because of their extremism,
but they have organized a series of large, often violent protests in
recent weeks to demand Chun's arrest.
   An alliance statement said Chun must face trial for widespread
corruption; the deaths and jailings of political opponents; and his
role in the bloody suppression of a 1980 uprising in the southern
city of Kwangju in which some 200 people died.
   Chun has denied personal corruption. But some of his relatives
and associates have been convicted of or charged with embezzling
government funds and other crimes involving millions of dollars.
   Roh, another former general and once a close Chun ally, appealed
to the nation Saturday for forgiveness for the former president. But
dissident and opposition groups responded by demanding a full
investigation.
   In a weekend appeal, Roh also promised to release as many
political prisoners as possible and restore to other government
opponents the civil rights of which they were stripped. People
facing trial for political protests would have their cases reviewed,
he said.
   Government officials, who declined to be identified, said at
least 200 prisoners would be freed by early December. Police said 11
students seized for trying to attack Chun's house Oct. 31 were
released Tuesday.
   Roh took power February after Chun stepped down. Roh won
presidential elections in December after the opposition split its
votes.

<TEXT>
   A group of Yonkers residents filed a lawsuit
Tuesday charging that a federal judge's desegregation order deprived
them of the right to live and work in neighborhoods ``free from
low-class people.''
   The suit, filed in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by the
Save Yonkers Federation, was the latest skirmish in an eight-year
legal battle that nearly brought the city of 195,000 to financial
ruin for defying the judge.
   The federation comprises 13 citizens' groups opposed to U.S.
District Judge Leonard Sand's order that Yonkers build 1,000 units
of low- and middle-income housing scattered throughout the city to
remedy decades of segregation.
   The suit, which lists several hundred residents and merchants as
petitioners, maintains that the order deprives them of ``the
benefits of living and-or working in neighborhoods free from low
class people (of any race) and the crime and housing rot which
nearly always accompanies their presence.''
   ``To victimize the innocent because of wrongs by others _ by
forcing upon those victims unwanted associations and by otherwise
jeopardizing them, their families and their property _ is surely to
violate a constitutional sense of justice,'' the suit said.
   It said the residnets ``have lost value in their property and
thus suffered economic injury.''
   The group's lawyer, Brooklyn Law School professor Henry Mark
Holzer, said the suit utilizes arguments never presented on behalf
of the city. Those include what he said were a First Amendment right
not to associate with certain people and the Tenth Amendment
establishment of federalism and separation of powers.
   The lawsuit was filed in an appeals court instead of U.S.
District Court because it challenges Sand's authority to impose the
desegregation plan, said Holzer. If the suit succeeds, Sand will
have to refashion a remedy, Holzer said.
   In 1985, five years after the U.S. Justice Department filed suit,
Sand found the city liable for 40 years of intentionally segregating
its schools and housing. A school desegregation plan went into
effect in 1986.
   Sand later ordered the housing desegregation plan. The City
Council defied him in August and was found in contempt, paying out
$819,000 in fines before capitulating to the threat of financial
ruin and agreeing to carry out the plan.
   Appeals of Sand's ruling have failed. The Supreme Court refused
to hear the case.
   Sand had no comment on the suit, according to his chambers.
   Jack O'Toole, president of the Save Yonkers Federation, said the
organization has received donations from all over the country and
would take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.

   An aspiring actor re-enacting a
scene from the movie ``Lethal Weapon'' accidentally shot himself in
the mouth in front of horrified fellow students, police said.
   Adam Smith Hancock, 22, of suburban Tujunga, was in critical
condition Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said hospital
spokesman Ron Wise.
   Hancock placed the barrel of the weapon in his mouth, pulled the
trigger and fell to the stage during the scene Monday afternoon at
the American Legion Hall, part of an actors' workshop from the
Beverly Hills Playhouse.
   ``There is no evidence at this time that it was a suicide
attempt,'' said police Lt. Bob Curtis. ``But the gun, a .22-caliber
semi-automatic handgun, belonged to him and was loaded with live
ammunition.''
   In a similar shooting four years ago, actor Jon-Erik Hexum picked
up a weapon loaded with blanks, put the barrel to his head and
pulled the trigger on the set of the ``Cover-Up'' television series.
Wadding from the blank cartridge was driven into his skull and Hexum
died six days later.
   That shooting on Oct. 12, 1984, was ruled accidental.

<TEXT>
   A senior Soviet officer Tuesday rejected
as a ``propaganda ploy'' a NATO report saying the Warsaw Pact
massively outguns the Western alliance in conventional arms.
   ``This paper ... is not useful for the purpose of the future
talks,'' Col.-Gen. Nikolai Chervov told a news conference.
   He referred to planned talks on conventional stability in Europe,
for which a mandate is being negotiated in Vienna between the 16
NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations.
   NATO's 28-page report was billed by Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner as an attempt to publicize relative East-West troop
strengths and challenge Moscow to issue its data.
   Chervov said Moscow would publish its own figures at an
unspecified date after consulting Warsaw Pact allies.
   Woerner said the NATO report ``Conventional Forces in Europe: The
Facts,'' is not the basis for negotiators from the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization at the new conventional stability talks.
   But Chervov challenged this. The study focuses on the ground and
air forces to be discussed at those talks and ignores naval forces
that are not at issue.
   Diplomats in Vienna say they hope the talks, which will cover the
territory from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains, will begin
early next year.
   The NATO report did not discuss the quality of East bloc weapons
and forces, only their numbers.
   It said Warsaw Pact nations have a large superiority in 11 major
arms systems. In eight of those, the Soviet Union alone outguns all
NATO nations and its Warsaw Pact allies combined, the report said.
   As a military man, Chervov said, he failed to understand the NATO
approach because ``the data provided do not make possible a real
assessment of the fighting power of the two alliances.''
   He disputed figures on the East bloc's capability and said the
NATO report erred in omitting the two military blocs' naval forces.
   ``In these areas, the United States and the NATO armed forces
hold a multifaceted superiority, including a 3-1 advantage in major
combat ships, cruisers, cruise missiles and mine sweepers and a
2.5-1 advantage in naval aircraft,'' Chervov said.
   ``The NATO paper is a propaganda ploy which cannot serve as a
basis for future negotiations,'' he said.
   The talks are expected to replace deadlocked Mutual and Balanced
Force Reduction talks on reducing troops in Central Europe.
   Negotiations for a conventional stability mandate have been upset
by a dispute between France and the United States about whether
talks should be limited to the 23 NATO and Warsaw Pact nations, or
extended to include Europe's 12 neutral and non-aligned states.
   Yuri Kashlev, chief Soviet delegate to the Helsinki review
conference, told Tuesday's news conference Moscow is ready to
include all its territory to the Urals in the new talks.
   He also said the Soviets are ready to accept Western suggestions
that certain areas of Turkey be excluded from the talks.
   The issue of how much Turkish territory to include, and a U.S.
military base at Adana in southern Turkey, is one of the last major
stumbling blocks to East-West agreement on a mandate. Both sides
expect the dispute to be resolved.

<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Participants in a series of ``citizens
assemblies'' held nationwide overwhelmingly favored cuts in defense
spending, and most also supported selected tax hikes and more money
for education, a public policy group reported Tuesday.
   Results of discussions at 13 of the special seminars involving a
cross-section of 1,000 people were made public by the Roosevelt
Center for American Policy Studies at a news conference Tuesday. The
report, ``A Citizens' Agenda for the President,'' was sent to
President-elect George Bush last week.
   ``This is something like an X-ray of what the American public
might think if they really got into it and all the cards were on the
table,'' said Michael Higgens, vice president of the Roosevelt
Center, which describes itself as a non-partisan public institute
set up to ``make representative democracy work.''
   The results, which showed the federal budget deficit as the major
concern among participants, were obtained from forums held between
Sept. 17 and Nov. 7. Those attending were nearly all at least high
school graduates but had a wide variety of backgrounds.
   About half were Democrats, 30 percent Republicans and the
remainder described themselves as independents, Higgens said. He
said the center tried to make the groups as representative of all
Americans as possible, but included only people who were willing to
study 90 pages of objective briefing material and then participate
in the day-long forums.
   Higgens acknowledged that the study could not be considered a
scientific survey of public opinion, but organizers believe it
accurately reflects the opinions people would have if they bothered
to inform themselves on national issues.
   The assemblies are to meet again in May to assess Bush's first
100 days in office and draw up a more extensive report for the
president.
   On military spending, 44 percent of participants supported a 3
percent, across-the-board cut and 46 percent supported a 10 percent
cut. Among the least popular expenditures were aid to resistance
fighters against communist regimes, funds for anti-missile defenses
and money to build up of conventional or strategic forces.
   ``In general, foreign aid and defense programs were ranked at a
lower priority than all domestic programs,'' the report said.
   Seventy percent said foreign aid should be cut; 57 percent wanted
cuts in Medicare payments to physicians; and 52 percent said
agricultural price supports could be reduced. Nearly all other
suggested cuts in domestic programs received the support of less
than half the participants.
   To further fight the deficit, 78 percent said tobacco, wine and
beer could be taxed at higher rates, while 60 percent advocated a
higher top personal income tax bracket of 33 percent, and more than
half said they would support higher user fees for government
services and gasoline tax hikes. Two-thirds also said business tax
deductions could be limited, and more than half advocated a higher
top corporate tax bracket.
   A majority of participants supported new federal spending on
education, energy, environmental programs, civilian research and
development, welfare reform and drug and crime prevention.
   Forums were held in Peoria and Chicago, Ill.; Kalamazoo, Mich.;
the Hickory-Unifour area and the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area of
North Carolina; Manchester, N.H.; Stockton and Los Angeles, Calif.;
Savannah and Atlanta, Ga.; Des Moines and Cedar Rapids-Iowa City,
Iowa; and Detroit, Mich.

   Valerie Harper, who left an NBC series in a
contract dispute last year, will star in a new series on CBS, the
network announced Tuesday.
   After Harper left ``Valerie,'' Sandy Duncan was brought in and
the show renamed ``The Hogan Family.''
   Harper sued Lorimar Productions and in September was awarded
$1.85 million in damages and a share of the profits from the NBC
show, of which she was part owner.
   Like ``Valerie,'' the CBS show will also be produced by Harper's
AV Productions and will be overseen by her producer husband, Tony
Cacciotti.
   It will be shot at MTM Productions, the site of the show that
launched Harper's career, ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' MTM also
produced the spinoff ``Rhoda,'' in which Harper starred.
   CBS did not yet have a title, premise or planned air date for the
new series. The executive producer is Paul Haggis, who was
responsible for the successful CBS sitcom ``One Day at a Time.''

<HEAD>Four U.S. Teams To Search For MIAs, Talks Planned Between Sides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has proposed talks with
Vietnam regarding future cooperation in the search for American
servicemen missing in action, the State Department said Tuesday.
   The talks would take place following a 10-day joint search by
four American and Vietnamese teams that starts Dec. 5, said
spokesman Charles Redman.
   Vietnam has agreed to a U.S. request to have four teams conduct
the search, an increase from the two teams that were allowed to
search various sites twice this year.
   ``We hope that this will enable us to make more rapid progress in
efforts to obtain the fullest possible accounting of those still
missing in action,'' Redman said.
   The U.S. teams will consist of technical personnel from the Joint
Casualty Resolution Center and the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory in Hawaii, he said. They will be investigating a number
of cases in the areas of Vinh and Dong Hoi, south of Hanoi.
   ``We have proposed to the Vietnamese to meet in Hanoi following
the conclusion of this activity, Dec. 19 to 21, to conduct technical
talks, to review our joint activities to date and our future work
program,'' Redman said. ``We appreciate the increased cooperation of
the government of Vietnam in these efforts.''
   Vietnam originally agreed to cooperate in the MIA searches for a
90-day period starting Sept. 1. The proposed talks would focus on
extending that period.
   Redman said the United States is ``hopeful that our joint
cooperation will continue for as long as necessary to obtain the
fullest possible accounting.''
   The United States says there are more than 2,400 Americans
missing in action from the Indochina war, most of them in Vietnam.
   The United States has rejected demands from the impoverished
Asian country that cooperation on the MIA issue be linked to the
establishment of diplomatic links. But it has allowed American
charitable groups to provide prosthetics and medical care for
handicapped children. Trade with Vietnam is banned by law.

   A construction worker fell three stories
and was impaled on a 6-foot steel rod, but that probably saved his
life, two doctors said.
   The heavy rod kept Jakie Dale Klaber from plunging six more
floors to the ground when it pierced his belly and groin, said Drs.
Tom Harris and Brian Zachariah, who treated Klaber at the scene
Monday.
   ``The rod basically arrested his fall,'' said Harris.
   Zachariah said that without the rod, Klaber ``would have
definitely gone over.''
   Harris said Klaber was lucid enough to answer routine questions
about his medical history.
   ``Given the circumstances, he was relatively calm,'' Zachariah
said.
   Firefighters cut the bar of concrete reinforcing rod and, with
the rod still imbedded in Klaber's body, lowered him to the ground
in a basket.
   The rod was removed in surgery at Humana Hospital-University of
Louisville.
   Klaber, 50, was in serious condition Tuesday with facial,
abdominal and groin injuries following the accident at a parking
garage being built by the Whittenberg Engineering and Construction
Co.
   Witnesses and a Whittenberg vice president said Klaber was
operating a crane from inside a control cab on top of the nine-story
building. He was hoisting a half-ton wooden concrete-form panel when
a wind gust apparently blew the 8-by-12-foot form into the wooden
cab, knocking it and Klaber over the edge.
   ``My first thought was that the crane ... killed the man in the
box,'' said Jefferson Circuit Judge Ken Corey, who watched from the
nearby Hall of Justice. ``I could see that guy inside as it headed
down.''
   Still inside the control cab, Klaber fell headfirst 36 feet to
the sixth-floor parking deck, which juts out farther than the top
three floors. He fell almost vertically onto the steel rod, located
within two feet of the garage's edge.
   The rod passed through some fat on Klaber's abdomen and part of
his groin, said Dr. Donald Thomas, director of university's
emergency room.

<TEXT>
   Freeways in southern San Diego County
increasingly are becoming deathtraps for illegal aliens who try to
cross them at night on their journey north, the California Highway
Patrol says.
   In four years, 56 undocumented aliens have been killed on
Interstate 805 and Interstate 5 within four miles of the U.S.-Mexico
border when they tried to beat traffic across up to eight lanes,
officials said. Ten have died in the last month.
   More people have been killed on those small stretches of freeway
than any comparable road elsewhere in the country, said Capt. Lee
Denno of the CHP's San Diego office.
   ``Let's say these were all American motorists that were struck
and killed,'' Denno said in an interview published Monday in The
Tribune of San Diego. ``I think the media in the U.S. and San Diego
in particular would jump right on this and through the use of
tremendous media exposure this would become an issue everyone would
jump on.
   ``Groups would be formed and things would happen. Something would
be done.''
   But because the victims are not U.S. citizens, he said, no one
has taken the lead in seeking a solution.
   ``They don't have any real spokesperson,'' Denno said. ``That's
probably why there is no hue and cry to do something about this
problem.''
   Denno said he started keeping track of alien pedestrian
fatalities on the freeways after becoming commander of the San Diego
area highway patrol in February 1986. He said he learned there were
seven in 1985 and the toll has increased over the years.
   Smugglers hired to guide aliens often lead a group of 12 or so at
a time across a highway. They usually try to cross in single file.
   ``The first people to cross will look and see that it is
reasonably safe for them to cross and they will start running,''
Denno said. ``Usually it is the people at the end of the line that
get struck and killed.''
   Many illegal aliens also are unfamilar with the speed of American
traffic because they come from remote or undeveloped regions,
officials said.
   The drivers involved are almost never cited because the accidents
are considered unavoidable, officials said.
   Several officials from various agencies, including the CHP, the
state Department of Transportation, the U.S. Border Patrol and the
San Diego Police Department have met informally to discuss the
situation.
   Options that have been discussed include putting up signs to
alert drivers that people might be crossing the freeway, reducing
the speed limit near the border and installing lights for better
roadway illumination.
   Enforcement of a reduced speed limit would be difficult at best,
officials said.
   Of the warning signs, Denno said, ``That's something that's never
been done before, but it is something that will probably be
considered down the road. You don't usually put signs on a freeway
to warn motorists of things that aren't supposed to be there in the
first place.''

<HEAD>Indiana Woman Helps Obtain Medical Treatment For Polish Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST CHICAGO, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crippled Polish child on Tuesday
entered a Chicago hospital, where she will be treated free of charge
for birth defects, thanks to the efforts of a Polish-American woman.
   Seven-year-old Basia Rduch, who weighs just 20 pounds, flew to
Chicago from her homeland Monday, accompanied by her mother,
Daniela, a widowed seamstress from the village of Godow.
   The trip was made possible by the efforts of Terri Ward, 35, of
East Chicago.
   ``I feel very lucky,'' Mrs. Rduch said through a translator. ``I
couldn't ask for anything more. I have a lot of hope in my heart.''
   The youngster was taken Tuesday to the Shriners Hospital for
Crippled Children in Chicago, where she will undergo tests for
treatment for her birth defects, which include severe curvature of
the spine. Her deformity makes it difficult for her to walk and
causes digestive problems.
   After doctors in Poland told Mrs. Rduch they could not help her
child, she began efforts to get treatment in the United States. She
wrote to a Chicago hospital, but the letter did not have the correct
address and was in Polish. She never received a reply.
   Mrs. Rduch didn't give up hope, however. In August, she gave a
copy of that letter to a neighbor, who is Ms. Ward's cousin.
   ``My cousin sent me a copy of this letter and just asked me if I
could take it up to the hospital,'' said Ms. Ward, who speaks Polish
and whose parents were born in Poland.
   But Ms. Ward didn't stop there. She learned about the Shriners
program of providing free care to needy crippled and burned
children, and the charity's Chicago hospital was contacted.
   Ms. Ward, a purchasing director for Specialty Steel Products in
Hammond, also collected $3,500 in donations for Basia, most of it
from Polish-Americans in northwestern Indiana. That money paid for
the mother and daughter's trip.

<HEAD>Production Delayed Again At Nuclear Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only U.S. plant which makes a critical
component of nuclear weapons won't be able to resume production
until at least next spring or summer because of persistent safety
concerns, Energy Secretary John S. Herring said Monday.
   Just last month, Energy Department officials said their Savannah
River Plant, near Aiken, S. C., would begin a phased restart of its
K reactor in December, and that it could resume production of
tritium in January. None of the three reactors at Savannah River has
produced weapons material since last April.
   ``We are hoping to start (the K reactor) in the spring, summer,''
Herrington said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``We are
not going to start up or operate a reactor that we are not satisfied
is totally safe.''
   Since October, engineers with the Energy Department and the
operating contractor, the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., have been
developing much more stringent operating and safety criteria.
   ``We're not slipping. We are using more caution, OK?'' Herrington
said in the interview.
   ``I am satisfied with the progress. I think our start-up
criteria, our modifications and our upgrade are proceeding well. I
do not want to put a predicted date on the start-up,'' said
Herrington.
   ``As we proceed toward start-up, we want to make sure that
everything is right. I don't want to have an arbitrary date of
December and then find out that all of the procedures are not in
place. I am now saying spring because I now think that is a
reasonable date. It may be that when we get to spring that it won't
be til summer. I don't see it going much farther than that,'' he
said.
   The three reactors at Savannah River are the only operational
facilities in the United States capable of producing two critical
nuclear weapons materials, tritium and plutonium. Herrington has
told Congress that the United States is ``awash'' in plutonium.
   Tritium decays at the rate of 5.5 percent per year and
administration and congressional sources say stockpiles will be
depleted badly within six months to two years, although the exact
numbers are classified. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen,
is used to boost the yield of nuclear weapons.
   Asked when tritium would be in critical short supply, Herrington
said: ``I think we are OK with spring and summer,'' but declined to
give an exact date.
   Herrington listed these new safety measures for Savannah River:
   _Requiring the shift superviser to have an engineering degree.
Officials at Savannah River say that nine out of the 12 shift
supervisers hold degrees, and the gap can be closed by reassigning
engineers from other duties.
   _Adding more technical support on each shift.
   _Using a five-shift rotation for key operations workers, one more
shift than before, freeing an entire shift for training at any given
time. This will double the hours each shift spends per year on a
computer simulator;
   _Completing seismic reviews and modifications necessary to assure
the ability of safety systems to shut down the reactor, remove decay
heat, and monitor conditions.
   _Increase Energy Department headquarters oversight and approval
of key start-up procedures.
   Both DuPont and the Energy Department are beefing up their
management and oversight of the Savannah River Plant, officials say.
For the first time, federal officials will be stationed directly at
each reactor rather than at the regional headquarters, which is
located at one edge of the sprawling 300-square-mile complex.
   DuPont, which agreed to run Savannah River in 1950 at the
personal request of President Harry S Truman, is turning the
operating contract over to the Westinghouse Corp. starting April 1.
   DuPont has reassigned the senior official in charge of reactor
operations to Savannah River from company headquarters in
Wilmington, Del., 500 miles away. When the contract changes hands,
the duties of 500 other key engineers who had been in Wilmington
will be moved to Aiken.
   Herrington said that beause of the changes, Savannah River and
other nuclear weapons facilities ``will emerge as a stronger
complex.''
   He initiated a review of the 17 major weapons facilities shortly
after taking office in February 1985, he said, and began a reform
campaign shortly thereafter, creating a new post of assistant
secretary for safety, health and environment with the power to shut
down plants.
   ``After Three Mile Island (a partial meltdown of a Pennsylvania
utility reactor in March 1979), the commercial nuclear power
industry got its act together. But the government procedures,
policies, plans did not keep pace,'' he said.
   ``A legitimate case can be made that some of our reactors ...
were being run with a pre-Three Mile Island mentality,'' he said.
Tighter oversight and monitoring are needed, he said, ``to bring us
up to the level of training and operation that the commerical sector
has attained.''

<TEXT>
   Nazi camp survivors are ready to
testify against an elderly man alleged to be one of 10 most-wanted
war criminals if Argentina upholds his extradition to West Germany,
officials said Tuesday.
   West German prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for former
SS Capt. Josef Schwammberger, accused of killing thousands of people
while he was commander of Nazi labor camps in Poland during World
War II.
   An Argentine judge on Monday ordered that Schwammberger, arrested
a year ago in a remote village, be extradited to West Germany.
Shwammberger's lawyers say they will appeal the extradition order.
   Schwammberger, 76 has been a fugitive since he disappeared from a
train in 1948 while being taken from Germany to American military
authorities in Austria to be tried, according to renowned Nazi
hunter Simon Wiesenthal.
   Prosecutors allege the former SS commander was responsible for
the deaths of more than 5,000 people, mostly Jews. Camp survivors
have testified that he shot to death starving prisoners or set dogs
on them.
   ``He was a sadist, an evil person,'' said Edward Blonder of
Florida, who testified at a Argentine deportation hearing in July
along with two other survivors of the Przemysl and Mielec labor
camps.
   Stuttgart prosecutor Helmut Krombacher said witnesses from two
continents are expected to testify against Schwammberger if he goes
to trial in West Germany.
   ``Testimony has been taken from witnesses in the United States,
Israel and Argentina,'' Krombacher said. ``Many witnesses will be
available.''
   Wiesenthal said dozens of labor camp survivors are anxious to
recount what they saw Schwammberger do to prisoners.
   ``These are all first-class witnesses,'' Wiesenthal said in a
telephone interview from Vienna.
   He said the witnesses are living in the United States, Israel,
Denmark, and Austria.
   Schwammberger had been a member of the Gestapo, the Nazis' secret
police, in Innsbruck, Wiesenthal said.
   The former SS commander was arrested in Austria just after the
end of the war in 1945 and a large quantity of valuables were
confiscated from him, Wiesenthal said.
   ``(Authorities) found a large number of rings, gold watches,
jewelry and diamonds taken from victims in the labor camps,'' said
Wiesenthal, who had been tracking Schwammberger for four decades.
   The Nazi hunter said he learned in 1971 that Schwammberger was
living in La Plata, Argentina, and informed prosecutors in Stuttgart.
   But Schwammberger was apparently tipped off and fled before
Argentine police could arrest him, Wiesenthal said.
   Schwammberger's name was on a list of 10 most-wanted Nazi war
criminals published in 1987 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles.
   The list appeared in Argentine newspapers, and authorities were
tipped off about Schwammberger's whereabouts, Wiesenthal said.
   Schwammberger was arrested on Nov. 13, 1987 in Huerta Grande, a
village about 500 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. Since then, he
has been jailed in La Plata, about 30 miles south of the capital.
   Argentine officials said they learned Schwammberger arrived in
Argentina in 1949 and worked for a chemical company for many years.

   A crackdown on people who avoid jury
duty suffered a setback when a man who had been excused from service
was brought to a courtroom in handcuffs by a different judge.
   Fred Avelino Sr. of Albany, N.Y., was visiting his wife in this
southern Connecticut city when he received a notice to report for
jury duty.
   Avelino was dismissed by one judge because he has been a New York
resident since 1946, but his name remained on the computerized jury
list and he was ordered arrested when he did not appear for jury
selection in a case heard by Judge Socrates H. Mihalakos.
   ``Sure I was shocked, I didn't expect this at all,'' said
Avelino, who received an apology Monday after the mix-up was
discovered.
   Avelino was the second person in two months to be arrested for
avoiding jury duty in Bridgeport, where judges have said they are
trying to head off a growing trend by people to resist jury duty.

<HEAD>S&L Losses Down In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Losses in the savings and loan industry shrank
by 60 percent in the third quarter, reflecting rescues of insolvent
institutions that transferred the red ink to the government's books,
a top regulator said Tuesday.
   Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, in a
luncheon meeting with reporters, also hinted at his agency's
recommendation for reshaping the federal rescue effort.
   Wall said the nation's 3,028 federally insured S&Ls lost $1.52
billion in the July-September period, down from a revised $3.82
billion in the second quarter and $3.93 billion in the first three
months of the year
   Earlier this month, bank board economist James Barth predicted
third quarter losses would narrow to about $2 billion. The second
quarter loss had previously been reported at $3.6 billion.
   The industry's earnings from current operations rose from $224
million in the second quarter to $364 million in the third.
Non-operating losses, reflecting mostly write-offs of loans already
gone bad, shrank from $3.50 billion to $1.31 billion.
   Bank board member Lawrence White said operating profits would
continue in the fourth quarter, but said the chances of the industry
posting an overall profit depended on how many bad loans remain to
be written off.
   A complete report on the industry's performance through Sept. 30
is not due out until Dec. 14.
   The $9.27 billion loss for the first nine months, up from $7.8
billion for all of last year, is the industry's worst since the
Depression.
   Wall attributed the partial stemming of the red ink last quarter
to the more than 140 closings and forced mergers of failed S&Ls. He
said the bank board hopes to have handled 200 by the end of the year.
   Some analysts and members of Congress have criticized the deals
because the bank board in many cases agrees to absorb much of the
rescued institutions' future losses. They say losses continue to
mount, although the losses don't show up on the industry's books.
   Meanwhile, Wall said the bank board next month will forward to
the Treasury Department its recommendation on how to structure the
continued cleanup of the S&L industry.
   Wall said the proposal being discussed is similar to this year's
bailout of the Farm Credit System. That provides for taxpayers,
through the Treasury, to pay the interest on bonds sold to raise
bailout money. It also establishes a special board including the
Treasury secretary to oversee expenditure of bailout funds.
   ``What we have on the agenda isn't far from that,'' Wall said. He
declined to elaborate.
   Treasury spokesman Arthur Siddon said the department's S&L plan
would not be released for at least several weeks. He said the
department still was trying to arrive at a firm estimate of the size
of the problem, projected at between $50 billion and $100 billion by
various analysts.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures commercial banks, was expected during a speech
on Wednesday to present his agency's recommendation for cleaning up
S&Ls.
   On another topic, Wall said he would like to remain as bank board
chairman in the next administration but has not yet been approached
by aides to President-elect George Bush.

<HEAD>Reporter, Driver, Charge Governor With Abduction, Assault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reporter and his driver
filed a complaint with police against a provincial governor,
alleging he abducted, assaulted and threatened to shoot them after
an interview, their newspaper said Tuesday.
   Zimbabwe's state-owned Mass Media Trust and one of its newspapers
which employs the two announced they will not report on the
governor's actions until the safety of their reporters is guaranteed.
   President Robert Mugabe called a news conference to say he was
awaiting an official report.
   ``We cannot act on the basis of newspaper reports,'' he said.
``The right way is, really, for those who have been assaulted to
make out a case.''
   Journalist Gibbs Dube and chauffeur Phillip Maseko of The
Chronicle, published in Bulawayo, made formal allegations to police
that Matabeleland Gov. Mark Dube chased them in his station wagon,
seized their car keys and forcibly escorted them to his home Sunday.
   There, according to their newspaper's report, the governor
punched them and threatened to shoot them with a pistol. This
occurred after interviewing the governor at his residence about gold
mining operations.
   Dube, unrelated to the governor, escaped from the residence at
Esigodini near Bulawayo while the governor allegedly was beating the
driver.
   Maseko was held more than two hours before the governor drove him
to a nearby police station and ordered his detention.
   Police freed Maseko five hours later after deciding they had no
grounds to hold him.
   ``I did not try to escape because I feared I would be shot,''
Maseko told his paper.
   Deputy Police Commissioner Douglas Chingoka broke an official
silence on the affair to criticize police officers. He said he would
punish Esigodini policemen if they unlawfully detained the driver.
   Zimbabwe Newspapers Ltd., owners of The Chronicle and all
Zimbabwe's other daily and Sunday newspapers, condemned what it
called brutal, unprovoked and premeditated attacks.
   ``This is an example of jungle law which Zimbabwe should not
tolerate from its leaders,'' said group chief executive Elias
Rusike. If the governor were not punished, ``Zimbabwe may be
entering a new frightening era where the rights of ordinary citizens
are trampled underfoot willy-nilly by those in authority.''
   The Chronicle recently has won popular acclaim for exposing cases
of alleged official corruption, including a report charging Gov.
Dube illegally grazes cattle on state land.
   The governor has made no official comment. When he was questioned
Sunday by The Chronicle, he reportedly said the reporter was held
because he did not have proper identification.
   Of the driver, who still was being detained at the governor's
residence, Dube was quoted as saying: ``You can write what you want
but I am going to work on this guy.''

<HEAD>Teen-Age Suspect In Slaying Found Hanged In Woods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCKLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-age suspect in the slaying of a
college student was found hanged in the woods Tuesday, a month after
his disappearance frightened residents and forced police to curtail
Halloween celebrations.
   The body of Mark Branch, 19, was found around 8 a.m. by hunter
Kevin Purrington of Buckland as he stalked two deer in the woods of
Hog Mountain.
   ``I heard something snap up above,'' Purrington said. ``I looked
up and I saw the body. ... I made it down that mountain in record
time.''
   The spot was about a mile from the road where Branch's car was
found Oct. 25, the day a search warrant was issued for his arrest in
the stabbing death of Sharon Gregory, 18.
   Branch was identified through a wallet found on his body,
Franklin County District Attorney Judd Carhart said at a news
conference.
   Carhart said Branch and Gregory were acquaintances. He called the
slaying ``an extremely violent murder involving numerous stab
wounds.''
   The cause of Branch's death was tentatively ruled a suicide and
tests were being conducted to determine how long Branch had been
dead, Carhart said. He said the body appeared partially decomposed
and he believed the youth had died weeks ago.
   He declined to speculate on a motive for the slaying or the
evidence that had led police to suspect Branch as the killer.
   ``That is a matter, and will always be a matter, of conjecture,''
Carhart said. ``This chapter of this tragedy is terminated. There
are no further suspects, and the case is closed.''
   Branch was the subject of intensive searches with dogs and
helicopters while rumors terrified the town of 18,000 people in
northwestern Massachusetts.
   The body of Gregory, a Greenfield Community College freshman, had
been discovered Oct. 24 by her twin sister in the bathtub of their
Greenfield home.
   As Halloween approached, community nervousness was increased by
reports that Branch was a fan of horror movies, particularly the
``Friday the 13th'' series in which the character Jason slashes his
victims.
   At the urging of town officials, Greenfield held the traditional
trick-or-treating for children a day early and limited it to
daylight hours.
   Concern flared again in early November when a Buckland home was
burglarized three miles from where Branch's car had been spotted and
the only items taken were food, winter clothes ad a knife.
   Police from New Hampshire to Connecticut said they received
reports of possible sightings of the young man, who had worked as a
grocery store clerk.
   On Nov. 14 and 15, a team from Harvard Medical School's Crisis
Management Group met with teen-agers and parents in Greenfield and
surrounding towns in an attempt to calm fears.

<HEAD>U.N. Launches $10 Million Child Health Program In Iran, Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY DUNPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UNICEF has launched a $10 million campaign to
restore health services for mothers and children in war-ravaged
areas of Iran and Iraq, its director said Tuesday.
   A major effort would be made to expand existing programs in each
country aimed at reducing infant mortality, said UNICEF Executive
Director James P. Grant.
   ``This is the first action of rebuilding the war-torn areas in
which both countries are implicity involved,' Grant said. ``The fact
that children are concerned is a prelude for working together in
other areas.''
   Grant spoke to reporters after returning from a six-day trip to
Iran and Iraq during which he met health ministers and other
government officials.
   The U.N. Childrens' Emergency Fund campaign follows a
U.N.-negotiated cease-fire in the war that took effect Aug. 20.
   Grant said the new UNICEF program was aimed at war-devastated
areas of Iran and Iraq.
   Grant said the first emergency medical supplies _ equipment for
midwives and refrigerators for medical supplies and vaccines _
arrived in five provinces in Iran and seven in Iraq.
   He said he would seek funds to support the campaign from
governments and humanitarian associations, and that Sweden and Italy
already have made contributions. The initial $1 million that kicked
off the health program came from UNICEF emergency funds, Grant said.
   Grant said Iran had cut its death rate by half since 1980,
meaning that about 100,000 children have been saved through improved
conditions such as health measures involving parents, teachers and
officials.
   A similar program in Iraq has saved 30,000 children, Grant said.

<HEAD>Hijacker Forced Woman At Gunpoint To Leave Husband Behind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   FRANKFURT, West Germany _ A hijacker of TWA Flight 847 put a gun
to the head of a pregnant U.S. passenger to force her to leave her
husband behind with other hostages aboard the commandeered plane, a
court heard Tuesday.
   Debra Toga also said the hijackers threatened to kill an American
passenger every five minutes.
   She testified at the trial of confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali
Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem charged with murder and air piracy
in the June 1985 hijacking. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was
killed in the ordeal and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Mrs. Toga, 30, was returning from a vacation and was seven months
pregnant when the Athens-to-Rome flight was seized. Although she
said she was not mistreated, Mrs. Toga said she heard other
passengers being beaten.
   During a stop at Algiers airport, the hijackers said they would
start killing Americans if the airplane were not refueled.
   Flight purser Uli Derickson ``told me that they were threatening
to kill one American passenger every five minutes,'' Mrs. Toga said.
   The plane was refueled and flew to Beirut.
   At one point, Mrs. Toga said, Hamadi reassured her that she was
safe and gave her fruit to eat.
   ``I was crying, but Hamadi told me that I had nothing to worry
about. He said they were interested only in young American men, but
they respected women and children,'' Mrs. Toga said.
   Stethem was killed at Beirut airport. Hamadi admits he was one of
the hijackers, but denies he killed the diver.
   Mrs. Toga said the other hijacker _ fugitive Hassan Ezzeddine _
threatened her with a gun just before she was freed in Algiers.
   ``I was chosen to leave the plane, and at that point I saw my
husband. I wanted to stay with my husband, but the other hijacker
put the gun to my head and told me to get out,'' she said.
   Her husband, Arthur, who testified later Tuesday, said: ``I was
petrified about what they did to my wife, I didn't know what had
happened to her.
   ``I was just sorry that I probably would never see my child,''
said Toga, 36.
   Under guidelines set by the court to protect witnesses, the
couple was not required to disclose their hometown. At the time of
the hijacking they lived in St. Louis.
   Before Mrs. Toga's testimony, prosecutors disclosed they had had
Hamadi's cell searched for drugs and secret communications he may
have received from Beirut. Prosecutor Peter Korneck said no drugs
were found but some documents were taken from the cell and copied.
   Hamadi and his lawyers said the documents were papers related to
the case. They charged the search was illegal and asked that Korneck
be dropped from the case. Judge Heiner Mueckenberger made no ruling.
   The defense attorneys also asked that officials from U.S.
television networks be called to testify.
   According to the attorneys, they had asked the FBI and the U.S.
Justice Department for permission to examine television tapes made
during the hijacking but had got no reply.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   An American who stowed away inside a
ship's container for three weeks will be repatriated to the United
States, an official said Tuesday.
   Sylvia Grimes-Harper would be flown out of South Africa as soon
as bookings could be arranged, said Dries Coetzee, regional
representative of the Home Affairs Department.
   Mrs. Grimes-Harper, 43, was found last week inside a sealed
container that had been loaded onto a freight train after arriving
aboard the Sextun, a freighter which docked in Durban after a
three-week voyage from Felixstowe, Britain.
   Authorities said she survived on a supply of baby food and
bottled water. She was discovered after a workman heard tapping from
the container.
   Authorities said Mrs. Grimes-Harper came to Britain in August
through London's Heathrow Airport. They said she declined to talk
about herself or explain why she decided to stow away to South
Africa.
   Coetzee said he did not know the woman's hometown and John
Dickson, a spokesman at the U.S. Consulate in Durban, said he was
not authorized to provide personal information about her.

   A Libyan civilian plane that strayed into Chadian
airspace was fired on and made an emergency landing, the Libyan news
agency JANA said Tuesday.
   Chad announced it captured the two Libyans aboard.
   The Italian-built Siai-Marchetti belonging to a civil aviation
club had two trainee pilots aboard who ``lost direction and strayed
into (the) border region with Chad,'' JANA said.
   The agency, monitored in Rome, said Chadian forces opened fire,
forcing the plane to land.
   Chad's Ndjamena radio reported Monday that Chadian armed forces
shot down a Libyan military plane over Omou in northern Chad, and
captured the two pilots.
   Libya and Chad recently re-established diplomatic relations after
years of border warfare.

<HEAD>Dole an Unlikely Water Carrier for Bush</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Senate Leaders Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minority Leader Bob Dole, overwhelmingly
endorsed Tuesday to continue as the Senate's Republican leader for
another two years, seems an unlikely water carrier for the new
president-elect, George Bush.
   Himself a defeated presidential candidate, Dole has some of his
own ideas on one of the most serious problem facing Bush, reducing
the federal budget deficit, and the two don't always coincide.
   And despite a couple of public attempts to gloss over the wounds
from this year's campaign, the hurt from that bruising contest will
be slow to heal.
   ``We are ready to go to work with a new administration,'' Dole
said Tuesday after winning, uncontested, another two-year stint as
GOP Senate leader. ``The election is over. He won fair and square.''
   Unlike Bush, who was born into a wealthy Eastern family, Dole
clawed his way to the top of politics from a middle-class background
in tiny Russell, Kan. Bush went to Yale, while Dole attended
Washburn Municipal University in Topeka. The class differences have
aggravated the two men's rivalry.
   But both also are pragmatists. With the Congress now even more
firmly in Democratic control than before the election, cooperation
and compromise will be the Republicans' only keys to success.
   Dole now will have to forge a working relationship with his new
Democratic counterpart, Maine Sen. George Mitchell, who was selected
as majority leader.
   Although often partisan and acerbic in his rhetoric, and with a
biting wit, Dole has become best known as a crafter of consensus
since he became party leader in 1984. ``Work it out'' has been his
motto.
   With the Reagan administration, Dole sought where possible to be
the administration's policy point man. He did it with particular
enthusiasm on issues like judicial appointments and aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   But he also was capable of independence, particularly where he
deemed it important to protect GOP senators' political interests. In
1988, Dole supported Reagan's position on just 68 percent of floor
votes, placing him about in the middle of the Republican pack on
that measure.
   Dole, 65, suffered machine gun wounds during World War II combat
in Italy that rendered his right arm useless. The affliction has
engendered in Dole support for programs to aid the handicapped and
the poor.
   He was first elected to the Senate in 1968 following service in
the House. His wife, Elizabeth, served as President Reagan's
transportation secretary before resigning to join Dole's
presidential campaign.

   Leftist rebels detonated mines
and opened fire on a truck carrying army troops Tuesday, killing
four soldiers and wounding eight, relief officials said.
   The rebels ambushed the truck near the El Angel sugar plantation,
about nine miles north of the capital, said Green Cross officials,
who asked not to be identified.
   The guerrillas, who belong to the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, on Monday urged civilians not to board military
vehicles they said were subject to attack.
   In a broadcast over their clandestine radio, the rebels also
denied they were responsible for a bomb that destroyed a bus and
trailer owned by a Mexican musical group.
   The bomb, detonated outside a San Salvador hotel Saturday,
destroyed the vehicles and equipment belonging to Los Flamers. Army
officials blamed guerrillas for the explosion.
   The rebel radio broadcast blamed right-wing groups ``that
systematically have viewed the Mexican people as an ally of the
communists'' for the explosion. Rebel leaders in the past have been
based in Mexico City.
   But Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid, whose six-year term
ends Thursday, has backed away from publicly supporting the rebels.

<TEXT>
   An ex-convict released from prison ahead of schedule
because of overcrowding was charged with first-degree murder Tuesday
in the deaths of two police officers allegedly shot with their own
guns.
   Charles Harry Street, 34, of Boynton Beach was ordered held
without bond on two murder counts by a Dade County judge.
   Street was arrested early Monday, an hour after police said he
disarmed two Metro-Dade officers, Richard Boles, 41, and David
Strzalkowski, 34. They were shot in the head and shoulders, over
their bulletproof vests.
   Authorities said Street then stole a patrol car and traded it for
another vehicle stolen at gunpoint in neighboring Broward County
before being caught by sheriff's deputies there.
   Street had been released from prison only 10 days before the
shootings after serving eight years of a 15-year attempted murder
sentence for shooting a man outside a bar. He has a 20-page criminal
record that includes numerous charges of assaulting police officers.
   Corrections officials said Street served more time than average
for a 15-year sentence because of frequent infractions in prison.
But they also said he got out nearly two years earlier than he
otherwise would have, because of overcrowing in Florida prisons.
   ``How could a prison system be so wrong in their profile of this
individual?'' asked Lisa Strachan, wife of the Oakland Park police
chief and member of a group calling for harsher penalties for
attacks on officers. ``How could a file contain 20 pages of a rap
sheet and not tell the probation and parole department that this
isn't a standard model citizen?''
   In 1980 alone, Street was arrested seven times _ three times on
charges of assaulting officers _ while free on bond on the attempted
murder charge in Palm Beach County, his record indicates.
   Palm Beach County State Attorney David Bludworth said more must
be done to stop releasing people like him.
   ``We cannot use overcrowding as an excuse to continually release
dangerous people that will commit crimes against our innocent
citizens,'' said Bludworth.
   But Metro-Dade Police Director Fred Taylor refuses to blame
corrections officials for his officers' deaths. ``I'm sure they did
not know when he was released from prison that he was violent,'' he
said.
   So far this year, five South Florida officers have been shot to
death, four of them in Dade County, counting the two officers slain
Monday.

<HEAD>FBI, Hispanics Recommend Ways To Assess Damages in Discrimination
Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is proposing to hire
Spanish-speaking linguists and to bolster its equal employment
opportunity office as part of a damages package for Hispanic agents
who won a racial discrimination suit against the agency.
   The 311 Hispanic agents who sued are being asked to respond to
the proposals by Dec. 15. The damages must be approved by U.S.
District Judge Lucias Bunton in El Paso.
   In papers filed Monday with Bunton, the Hispanic agents asked the
court to assess damages according to a formula they devised, while
the FBI asked they be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   In a Sept. 30 decision, Bunton supported Hispanic agents'
contention that the FBI had discriminated against them in job
conditions, assignments and promotions.
   Bunton suggested then that the FBI pay court costs, pay
Spanish-speaking agents more for the specialized work they do, and
improve the promotion system and the equal employment opportunity
process in which discrimination complaints are made.
   Under the FBI's proposal, agency equal employment opportunity
counselors would receive better training and the office would be
supervised by an executive assistant FBI director.
   The FBI also promised to hire at least 30 Spanish-speaking
linguists to monitor wiretaps and to pay agents bonuses for
improving foreign-language fluency.
   The Hispanic agents had complained they were unfairly burdened
with undesirable wiretaps and dangerous assignments because of their
appearance and Spanish-speaking ability. They contended that
non-Hispanic agents who spoke Spanish were given better assignments.
   The FBI also said back pay might be due some agents, and proposed
having plaintiffs fill out a long forms to determine whether they
should receive back pay and how much.
   But the plaintiffs, represented by attorneys Hugo Rodriguez and
Antonio Silva, said such a process would require separate hearings
on each plaintiff. They proposed a formula to determine how much pay
each plaintiff gets, based on tenure, employment status and salary.
   Bunton set the Dec. 15 deadline for the plaintiffs to reply. The
FBI has until Dec. 30 to counter that response.
   The class-action lawsuit was filed in January 1987 by Bernardo
Matias ``Mat'' Perez, the second-in-command in the El Paso office
and at the time the highest-ranking Hispanic FBI agent.

   A 16-year-old male panda who has lived at the
Cincinnati Zoo since September packed up Tuesday for a trip to
permanent new quarters at a Mexico City zoo where he is to
participate in a breeding program.
   Chia Chia, a 290-pound giant panda who likes to munch bamboo,
attracted an estimated 400,000 people to a display featuring him at
the Cincinnati Zoo, where he arrived in early September from the
London Zoo. He had lived in London since age 2, when he was captured
in China.
   Officials had projected that 500,000 people would come to see
Chia Chia, and blamed rainy weather and the fact that he was
secluded for several days at the beginning of the exhibit because he
was acting homesick and out of character.
   Cincinnati Zoo officials said Chia Chia was being placed in a
large crate for shipment by van late Tuesday to Chicago, where he is
to be put on a jet Wednesday for a trip to the Chapultepec Zoo in
Mexico City. That zoo has the best record for breeding pandas
outside China.
   ``We're very sad to see him go,'' Cincinnati Zoo spokeswoman
Barbara Brady said. ``He's very relaxed and comfortable and happy
here, and we're going to miss him.''
   Giant pandas are an endangered species, and zoos worldwide are
working to try and save them by encouraging reproduction. About 800
pandas are believed to exist worldwide.
   Officials at the Mexican zoo plan to pair Chia Chia with
6-year-old Tohui.
   The Cincinnati Zoo agreed to apply all excess revenue from Chia
Chia's visit toward the cost of new quarters built for him at the
Mexico City zoo. Any money left over then will go to a panda
conservation fund to be administered jointly by the Cincinnati and
London zoos.
   Chia Chia's visit produced about $200,000 in revenue, Cincinnati
Zoo officials said. Zoo officials said they have not worked out all
of the money allocation and are uncertain whether money will be left
over for the conservation fund.

<HEAD>Group Sues FBI To Seal Files From Anti-Terrorism Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization opposed to Reagan
administration policy in Central America filed suit against the FBI
on Tuesday, seeking to seal files compiled during the bureau's
anti-terrorism probe of the private group.
   The class-action lawsuit alleges that during the March 1983-June
1985 probe, the FBI spread false information about the Committee in
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, linking it to terrorism
and hurting its efforts to raise money and enroll new members.
   The CISPES lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, seeks an order
preventing the FBI from using records gathered during the probe and
requiring the bureau to seal the files and deposit them in the
National Archives.
   FBI Director William Sessions told the group in a letter two
weeks ago that the bureau would consider expunging the records of
individuals who believe they are named in the investigation and who
request such action.
   Margaret Ratner, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights
which helped CISPES file the suit, said the group is willing to
continue discussions with the FBI on the matter while the suit is
pending.
   The bureau, following a review by the Justice Department, ended
the CISPES investigation after failing to establish any substantial
link between CISPES and international terrorism. Sessions said in
September that the probe had been too broad and he disciplined half
a dozen FBI personnel for mishandling it.
   ``Director Sessions explained the investigation by saying that it
was an aberration,'' said Ratner. ``How can an investigation of such
massive scope be an aberration? It was the work of scores of FBI
offices around the country.''
   The suit alleges that the names of hundreds of people involved
with CISPES or other groups investigated in 178 spinoff
investigations are contained in several government computer
databanks, including the Terrorist Information System.
   Many of the names also have been disseminated to military
intelligence agencies as well as the State Department, the suit said.
   One of the plaintiffs, Catherine Cornell of Cincinnati, a
graduate student at Xavier University, said she is concerned she
will have difficulties in her teaching career because her name is in
FBI files from the CISPES probe.
   Ms. Cornell said she may be saddled with the unfounded and unfair
stigma of ``who would hire a terrorist?'' She and her husband, Paul
Knitter, who teaches theology at Xavier, have traveled to Nicaragua
and oppose the administration's Central American policies, but they
are not CISPES members.
   Ms. Cornell said a colleague of her husband's told her that the
FBI had visited him at Xavier in May 1987, two years after the
CISPES probe ended, and wanted to know about Knitter's reputation on
campus and what he was teaching.
   Mike Lent of the CISPES national office said the group has gotten
letters from contributors saying they would no longer donate money
to the group because they were afraid their names would turn up in
FBI files.
   Some private organizations ``have said they had concerns about
working with us because of the fact we were under FBI
investigation,'' said Lent.
   The suit said that although the investigation ended in 1985,
information supporting the probe's validity was disseminated during
a February 1988 appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee
by the FBI's Oliver Revell.
   The suit also said a newspaper article last June quoted Sessions
as saying there had been a sufficient basis for the probe. In
September, however, after an internal FBI review of how the probe
was conducted, Sessions said the basis for the probe was information
provided by an informant who proved to be unreliable.

<HEAD>Reagan National Security Adviser Scoffs at Soviet Idea on Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's call for a ``Common European
Home'' shared by the East and West is merely an attempt to preserve
Soviet dominance over Eastern Europe, President Reagan's national
security adviser said Tuesday.
   In a speech prepared for a conference of the Institute for
Foreign Policy Analysis, Army Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell said Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev should be praised for seeking reform
in his country.
   But at the same time, Powell, noting the 40th anniversary of the
North Atlantic Treaty Alliance in 1989, said this is no time for the
West to let down its guard.
   As an example, he cited what Gorbachev had proposed as a new
structure in Europe in which ``all nations _ East and West _ can
live in peace and harmony.''
   ``The Soviets assure us that there would be room in this house
for the United States and Canada as well,'' Powell said. ``We
appreciate the assurance. But we did not ask for it, nor do we need
it. We are in Europe, not at the invitation of the Soviet Union, but
in alliance with our Western allies.''
   Powell, who likely will be returning to full-time duty in the
Army when Reagan's term ends Jan. 20, asked his audience to consider
what lies behind the Soviet call for a ``Common European Home.''
   ``As I see it, it is an attempt to tie the future to the past, to
freeze the ... European status quo,'' he said. Powell acknowledged
that his conclusion ``may seem odd,'' given the Soviet
pronouncements about a new era of political thinking, embraced in
such terms of ``glasnost'' and ``perestroika.''
   But Powell said he believes, nevertheless, that the Soviet
proposal ``is an idea wedded to the past.''
   ``Forty years after the Soviets imposed their presence in the
middle of Europe,'' he said, ``the citizens of these countries still
look to the West as their historical, cultural and political
homeland. Their ferment today is a testament to the strength and
durability of these aspirations.''
   He also said the Soviets have ``rushed to construct a new home
for all of us'' because the European allies of the United States
have, at last, moved ``to construct a European pillar'' of strength,
challenging the Soviet goal of predominant power on the continent.
   ``If we analyze what this Soviet-built home would contain,'' he
said, ``we find some very old ideas indeed _ unbalanced disarmament
proposals, dissolution of military alliances, removal of foreign
bases and acceptance _ yes, acceptance _ of the ideological division
of Europe presently enforced by Soviet power.''

   Two other people in the shop were not injured and no money was
taken, police said.
   The man fled, and Wilt staggered outside the shop behind him
before collapsing on the sidewalk, officers said.
   Police were looking for a man in his early 30s, and said they had
no motive for the shootings.

<HEAD>Mitchell: From Janitor's Son To Senate Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Mitchell, the new Senate majority
leader, first drew the nation's attention when he looked Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North in the eye and told him he had no monopoly on
loyalty.
   ``Please remember ... that it is possible for an American to
disagree with you on aid to the Contras, and still love God, and
still love this country, just as much as you do,'' Mitchell told the
fervent Marine officer at the nationally televised Iran-Contra
hearings.
   Although that moment represented something of a national debut
for the Maine Democrat, he had already made himself a hero among
fellow party members.
   Mitchell, as chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign
Committee, helped engineer the 1986 comeback that saw Democrats
regain control of the Senate, which they had lost in President
Reagan's 1980 landslide.
   His reward: instant clout on the Democratic side of the aisle and
appointment as the Senate's deputy president pro tempore, an
unexciting post but an important measure of the esteem in which he
was held by his colleagues.
   Now, after an intensive backroom campaign launched after Sen.
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., announced last April he would step aside as
majority leader, Mitchell has defeated two more senior colleagues to
take the prize.
   The losers were Sens. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii and J. Bennett
Johnston, D-La.
   Mitchell's elevation to the Senate's top leadership post gives
him control of the chamber's agenda as the 101st Congress begins its
work and as President-elect George Bush launches his administration.
   It marks a new begining after Byrd's long tenure as party leader,
and many Senate Democrats hope Mitchell can use it to project a
positive, forward-looking image for their party in the wake of three
successive defeats for the presidency. He has vowed to share his
authority with colleagues saying, ``I do not intend to be a one-man
band.''
   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., said he told his colleagues inside the
Democratic Caucus that Mitchell has the ability to create an
atmosphere of ``calm statesmanship that reaches beyond the
prejudices of regionalism ... the ability to achieve a truly
national consensus on policies that reject the easy answers.''
   Mitchell, 55, who has been active in Maine's Democratic politics
since 1968, is a protege of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, whom he
served as administrative assistant in the early 1960s.
   After a number of political setbacks, including defeat in a bid
for governor in 1974, Mitchell, with Muskie's backing, was appointed
first as U.S. attorney for Maine, then as a federal district judge,
a lifetime appointment.
   In 1980, when Muskie resigned from the Senate to become secretary
of State, he recommended to Maine's Democratic governor that he
appoint Mitchell to fill the vacancy.
   Two years later, Mitchell won the seat in his own right by a
commanding 61 percent of the vote. He won a second term this year by
an even more impressive 81 percent.
   In the Senate, Mitchell compiled a largely liberal voting record
and became a champion of the environment, especially in the battle
against acid rain, and was an early and outspoken critic of Reagan
administration environmental policies.
   As chairman of the Finance Committee's health panel he is an
advocate for a major long-term health care plan.
   On the Veterans Affairs Committee, Mitchell backed successful
1984 legislation to help Vietnam veterans cope with diseases
believed to be caused by exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange.
   As a member of the Senate Iran-Contra Committee, Mitchell was a
steady, quiet, lawyerlike questioner.
   But as the hearings went on he became an increasingly outspoken
critic of those inside the Reagan administration, who, he said, had
subverted the authority of the president and the Constitution by
selling arms to Iran and arranging for the diversion of part of the
proceeds to Nicaragua's anti-leftist Contra rebels.
   In his address to North and the public watching on television,
Mitchell invoked the memory of his immigrant mother and laborer
father and the emotions he said he felt when, as a federal judge, he
conferred citizenship on immigrants.
   He told North that when he asked new immigrants why they wished
to live in the United States, many of them said the reason was that
``in America you can criticize the government without looking over
your shoulder.''
   That's what democracy is all about, the senator said. ``The
freedom to disagree with the government.''
   Mitchell's father was a utility company laborer who later worked
as a janitor. His mother, an immigrant from Lebanon, worked at a
wool mill in Waterville, Maine, where the family lived.

   U.S. corporations reported a slight 0.2 percent
increase in profits in the July-September quarter after posting a
large gain in the previous three-month period, the government said
Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said third-quarter profits after taxes
rose $400 million to $163.1 billion, the worst showing since a 2.5
percent loss in the final quarter of 1987.
   Robert Dederick, an economist with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago,
said profits are in part rebounding from the unusually strong 8.9
percent increase in the second quarter. But he said earnings also
were hurt because inflation is forcing companies to pay more for
labor and materials.
   ``They weren't able to pass on those cost increases that occurred
... This is a profit squeeze,'' he said. If it continues, it could
cut into U.S. corporation's strong spending to upgrade equipment and
expand production.
   Corporate cash flows, a measure intended to show the funds
corporations have available for investment, fell 0.7 percent in the
third quarter, following a 1.4 percent rise in the April-June period.
   However, if unemployment remains low, Dederick said corporations
likely will succeed in raising prices to customers and profits will
rebound, he said.
   Corporate profits before taxes were up 0.6 percent in the third
quarter to $307.7 billion, following a 6.9 percent increase in the
previous three-month period.
   Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.5 percent to $105.7
billion in the third quarter, up from a 1.8 percent gain in the
second quarter.

   The pilot of a Delta Air Lines jetliner that
crashed Aug. 31, killing 14 people, testified Tuesday that some
rules might have been bent in readying the Boeing 727 for takeoff
but that preparations were adequate.
   Larry Davis admitted seeming deviations from the rules under
questioning by aerospace engineer Jeff Gorney as the National
Transportation Safety Board opened an inquiry into the crash on
takeoff at Dallas International Airport. Ninety-four people survived.
   For instance, the Delta veteran of 23 years said he had used hand
signals instead of calling out completion of each item on the
pre-flight checklist and had made a takeoff briefing at the gate
instead of on the runway.
   ``I like to get as much done as possible before we get into the
position of getting rushed,'' said Davis.
   Gorney also said a flight attendant was allowed into the cockpit
when the jet was waiting to take off, despite an Federal Aviation
Administration rule requiring a ``sterile'' cockpit once the plane
has left the gate.
   But he noted that the plane was ``waiting in a line of traffic''
and added: ``I don't believe it was a critical phase of flight, but
technically it was (in violation).''
   The FAA requires pilots to go through a checklist but does not
specifically require a verbal a ``challenge and response'' between
pilots. The agency, however, has made clear on many occasions that
such an exchange is preferable.
   According to NTSB documents, Delta procedures Aug. 31 only
suggested a verbal exchange during some phases of the checklist.
   FAA recently chastised Delta for inadequate cockpit discipline
and poor coordination and communications among pilots, and Delta has
said that it will formalize the checklist process with increased
emphasis on verbal challenges.
   Delta procedures say the pre-flight briefing should take place
``before takeoff'' but also says it could begin during the ``before
start check'' which normally occurs about five minutes before the
plane pushes back from the gate.
   Davis testified that he went to full power as soon as he felt
engine ``compressor stalls'' unlike any he had ever felt before.
   ``It was like driving a car 60 mph down the highway and driving
into a water puddle. It was pronounced deceleration,'' Davis he said
under questioning from a representative of Pratt & Whitney,
manufacturer of the airplane's engines.
   Investigators have ruled out mechanical failure as a cause of the
stalls, and have focused instead on the position of the wing flaps,
which the NTSB said were found retracted instead of extended for
takeoff in the wreckage.
   The wing flap lever in the cockpit was in the wrong position
after the crash, the board said. But in the cockpit recording, the
co-pilot can be heard saying ``15, 15, green light'' before takeoff
to verify the flaps' proper deployment.
   Davis said Tuesday he did not know if the other crew members
might have touched the flap handle as the plane was in trouble.
   ``I was too busy flying the plane. I wouldn't have seen it,'' he
said.
   A pilots union contends a ``split flap configuration'' may have
occurred, placing one flap up and one down. The union contends that
in that case, the takeoff warning system of the 727 would not
necessarily alert the crew of the danger.
   The Air Line Pilots Association has accused the NTSB of making a
premature finding of pilot error.
   Air Line Pilots Association spokesman John Mazor, listening to
Davis' testimony, said it is standard for pilots with Davis'
experience to deviate slightly from procedures.
   ``There are reams and reams of manuals and regulations. It would
be impossible to remember them all,'' Mazor said.
   Fourteen of the 108 people on board died. The three-man flight
crew was among the survivors.
   ``It's fortunate the crew is alive. That's not always the case.
We're very hopeful the crew will be able to provide assistance where
in other crashes there's no (surviving) crew,'' NTSB spokesman Mike
Benson said before the hearing.

   NASA forged ahead Tuesday with the
countdown for the secret mission of space shuttle Atlantis despite a
forecast for unacceptably high wind and rain showers at launch time.
   Because of the forecast for Thursday morning liftoff, shuttle
managers said they would meet again Wednesday for a more up-to-date
look at the situation. The five astronauts on Atlantis are to
release a huge spy satellite in orbit.
   Otherwise, said the top level NASA Mission Management Team,
``preparations for launch are going very well.''
   The managers said in a statement they weren't concerned by one
lingering problem: a leaking tire on the shuttle's main landing gear.
   The leak rate was 1.7 pounds per square inch a day on a tire that
on Tuesday held 333 pounds. The agency said at that rate the
pressure would remain high enough for a week more on the launch pad.
The tire must have at least 275 psi when the spacecraft lands at
Edwards Air Force Base.
   Technicians can't reach the tire, which is filled with gaseous
nitrogen, while the landing gear doors are closed. A refill would
require rolling the shuttle back to its hangar and separating it
from the external fuel tank, a process that would take weeks.
   The upcoming launch is being treated with as much secrecy as
possible and the Air Force has said only that it is scheduled for
Thursday between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. EST. The precise time will
be disclosed just nine minutes before liftoff. The big countdown
clocks at the site were kept blank.
   Despite the hushed atmosphere, much is known about Atlantis'
mission. The astronauts will release a $500 million satellite _ the
first of a series called Lacrosse _ that can discern targets of
military interest in 80 percent of the Soviet Union.
   Once they have released the satellite, dropping it overboard
using the shuttle's robot crane, Atlantis will hover nearby to make
sure everything works. If it doesn't, the astronauts will retrieve
the Lacrosse and bring it back to Earth.
   NASA said there was a 70 percent probability that the weather
will be below the strict limits laid down since the Challenger
explosion Jan. 28, 1986, that claimed seven lives.
   Those rules include winds of less than 19 mph from the south or
28 mph from any direction, no rain at the pad or in the flight path
and no thunderstorms within five miles.
   The forecast was for winds of 15 to 28 mph, three layers of
clouds and isolated showers.
   The flight will be the third shuttle mission dedicated to the
military and the second flight since the Challenger disaster. No
details will be released during the flight unless something goes
wrong with the spacecraft. The other all-military flights were in
1985.
   The crew will be Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson, spaceship
commander; Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, pilot; and mission
specialists Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of
the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   Gibson and Gardner practiced the landings they would have to make
on the Kennedy Space Center runway in case of engine failure,
rehearsing the steep descents in an airplane built to handle like a
shuttle. All five astronauts then were given medical examinations.

<HEAD>Conable Denounces Barriers to Third World Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World Bank President Barber B. Conable on
Tuesday denounced trade barriers that prevent Third World nations
from selling their goods in the United States and other industrial
countries.
   Conable said aid to Third World countries was only half as much
as they could earn if they were permitted to sell their goods freely
to the donor countries.
   ``If you were to eliminate all international aid and all
trade-distorting obstacles, you would have twice as a good a
situation in terms of resource transfers for the developing world as
you've got now,'' he said.
   Conable estimated the annual value of aid from all industrial
countries at $35 billion a year, while their trade barriers
prevented exports to them worth $60 billion. That was only the
primary effect of the barriers, because additional trade would
stimulate Third World growth, he added.
   ``The Caribbean countries alone have lost three quarters _ over
$250 million worth _ of their annual sugar exports to the United
States,'' he said.
   ``In 1987 the U.S. imposed anti-dumping actions on carnations (to
limit imports) from Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Chile. All four
exported only $16 million worth of cut flowers to the U.S.; during
that same year they paid almost 150 times that amount in interest to
U.S. commercial creditors,'' he in a statement he will submit next
week in Montreal to a meeting of cabinet members of nearly 100
governments. The session will review progress toward dismantling
trade barriers.
   Conable distributed blame widely.
   He noted that West European countries became the world's biggest
exporters of beef and wheat while the share of the market supplied
by Argentina and Uruguay, two of the lowest cost producers, dropped
sharply. He said the high price paid for rice to Japanese farmers,
five times the world level, closed off sales by Thailand and
Pakistan.
   The Third World's $1.2 trillion debt is not up for discussion in
Montreal. But Conable said it clearly is related to trade since
whatever may be done about debt, the Third World will need to sell
more goods.
   Three years ago, then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III
proposed additional lending to Third World countries to help them
grow out of their problems. Little additional lending has been
forthcoming. More recently, Baker, whom President-elect George Bush
has tapped as his secretary of state, has been promoting a ``menu of
options'' under which debt may be reduced by agreement between
creditor banks and debtor governments.
   ``You're getting an evolution of the so-called Baker plan,''
Conable said.
   The World Bank is the biggest source of international aid. The
bank, owned by 151 countries, lends the Third World about $20
billion a year.

   An attorney for 13 Cuban detainees argued
Tuesday they have a constitutional right to petition for political
asylum before being sent back to the homeland they fled in the 1980
Mariel boatlift.
   Lee Ochoa of Miami, an attorney for 13 of 15 Cubans convicted of
crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder, told U.S.
District Judge U.W. Clemon that some of the Cubans were afraid to go
home because they did not know how they would be treated by Fidel
Castro's government.
   Clemon said he will rule Monday on whether to allow the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to fly the 13 back to Cuba.
Clemon said he wanted to give attorneys for the Cubans time to
support their request for a preliminary order blocking the
deportation.
   The INS on Nov. 17 notified 15 Cubans at at the Federal
Correctional Institution at Talladega that they would be deported
within 72 hours. However, the next day the government promised
Clemon it would not send them home until their attorneys had a
chance to study their files.
   Leo Ochoa of Miami, attorney for 13 of the 15, told Clemon that
they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylym
and to due process.
   ``In this country we want to do things fairly and properly,''
Ochoa said. But Lauri Fillppu of the INS said that the Cubans' only
claim for asylum is that they might be harmed in Cuba. He said the
11th U.S. Circuit Court in Atlanta already had rejected that
argument.
   Fillppu questioned what he called ``a last-minute tactic'' by the
Cubans, claiming there was no new evidence.

<HEAD>Mexico's New President: Tough and Flexible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari has proved himself
tough and flexible, necessary qualities for dealing with the
economic crisis and growing political opposition he will face after
becoming president on Thursday.
   He is an economist with no experience in elective office, and at
40 will be Mexico's youngest president in half a century. That may
be fitting, since more than half the nation's 84 million people are
under 16.
   Salinas also has a disadvantage none of his predecessors has
experienced: serious division within the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, which is known by its Spanish initials PRI and has governed
Mexico since 1929.
   In addition to being the youngest president in decades, Salinas
also is one of the best educated. He has two master's degrees and a
doctorate in public administration, all from Harvard, and speaks
fluent English and French.
   The new president is short, trim and bald, dresses smartly and
has a full black mustache that enhances an expression of
half-puzzled wistfulness that often appears on his face.
   Friends who know him well, including political writer Adrian
Lajous, say the genial, shy exterior hides a man of considerable
ability and political savvy. As evidence, they offer the fact that
he won the presidential nomination from a half-dozen older PRI
rivals.
   As budget secretary under Miguel de la Madrid, the outgoing
president, Salinas revealed himself as a deft political infighter,
excellent organizer and stickler for efficiency.
   ``He is very fast mentally,'' Lajous wrote recently. ``He plucks
ideas out of thin air. His thinking is very sophisticated ... and
it's a pleasure to watch him sparring.''
   Salinas is known as a demanding boss who expects things to run on
time _ what Mexicans call ``American time'' rather than the less
precise ``Mexican time.''
   So greatly does the new president admire Japanese discipline that
he sends his children to a school run by Japanese.
   He was born April 3, 1948, in Mexico City but his family is from
Nuevo Leon, a northern industrial state. He married Cecilia Occelli
Gonzalez in 1972, seven years after they met at a dance, and they
have three children: Cecilia, 14; Emiliano 12, and Juan Cristobal, 9.
   A keen sportsman, Salinas was a member of the Mexican riding
association and the national equestrian team, winning a silver medal
at the 1971 Pan American Games. He keeps fit by running and playing
tennis and is an ardent soccer fan.
   Like his most recent predecessors, Salinas rose through the ranks
of the bureaucracy as a loyal PRI member. He comes from an old
family of seasoned PRI politicians that settled in the small town of
Agualeguas in Nuevo Leon in the 18th century, and joined the party
at age 18.
   Raul Salinas, his father, has served in the Senate and as
commerce secretary. His mother, Margarita de Gortari Carvajal, is an
economist and was active in party politics for many years.
   Mexico's president is limited to a single six-year term and
Salinas faces problems that would have given some of his
predecessors nightmares.
   An economic crisis has impoverished Mexico since the bottom fell
out of world oil prices in 1982.
   Enormous grass-roots support that kept the PRI in power for two
generations has diminished and the spendthrift days of the oil boom
are gone.
   Payments on the $102 billion foreign debt have sapped development
and prompted complaints the country's efforts to develop industry
and increase exports serve only to pay Wall Street bankers.
   Salinas won narrowly in an election July 6 that was tainted by
charges of fraud. The PRI won only 260 seats in the 500-seat Chamber
of Deputies, compared with its customary 70 percent or more.
   The wishes of his predecessors often amounted to orders, but
Salinas will have to negotiate and compromise with opposition
leaders who want to use public disaffection with the PRI as a
springboard for the 1994 election.
   Political analysts say the results last election's results
indicate people are weary of the PRI's high-handed ways and want a
change.
   At a recent rally, Salinas said the ``one-party'' era is over and
the PRI must learn to hustle for votes, but there were more charges
of fraud in recent state elections.
   In speeches and interviews, Salinas has said he will
``modernize'' Mexico, paring down the bureaucracy, getting rid of
state-owned companies that lose money, fighting corruption,
balancing the budget, reducing inflation, forcing export industries
to become more efficient and reforming the PRI.

   Here are some facts and figures about Mexico:
   THE LAND
   Mexico shares a 2,062-mile border with the United States. Its
neighbors on the south are Guatemala and Belize. It covers 761,064
square miles, about three times the area of Texas. The Pacific Ocean
is on the west, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean on the east.
The southern half is lush and tropical, the north arid. Much of the
terrain is mountainous.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE
   Mexico has about 84 million people, roughly half of them under
age 16, and 18 million of them live in the Mexico City metropolitan
area. About 55 percent are of Spanish-Indian descent and 29 percent
Indian. An estimated 90 percent are Roman Catholic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY
   Crude oil exports are the heart of the economy, but non-petroleum
exports are growing rapidly. Sharply lower oil prices caused an
economic crisis and the standard of living has been cut in half
since 1982. Payments on the $102 billion foreign debt take money
from development, a major problem for a nation that must create 1
million jobs a year just to keep up with population growth. The
economy is a mixture of private enterprise and the government, which
runs many industries, including oil through the monopoly Pemex.
Mexico is the United States' fourth biggest trading partner; the
two-way exchange in 1987 was $35.1 billion. Inflation reached 159.2
percent in 1987 but has been reduced to less than 1 percent a month.
The daily minimum wage is $3.50.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT
   Mexico has a federal, republican form of government with a
500-seat Chamber of Deputies and a 64-seat Senate. The president is
elected every six years for a single term. The nation is divided
into 31 states and the Federal District, part of Mexico City. The
Institutional Revolutionary Party has governed since its founding in
1929. Relations with the United States are historically paramount
and often tense. Many Mexicans still resent the loss of more than
half the country's territory to the United States in the first half
of the 19th century.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and the
finance ministers of America's major allies will meet soon after
President-elect George Bush takes office in January, a U.S.
government source said Tuesday.
   The source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the
session was planned to allow Brady to answer questions from his
counterparts about the new administration's economic policies.
   The Washington Post reported Tuesday that a tentative plan for
the meeting was outlined in Paris two weeks ago at a meeting
attended by Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford and the
deputy finance ministers of Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Canada and Italy.
   The seven countries, dubbed the Group of Seven, meet each year
for economic summits. Finance ministers from the nations convene
three or four times a year to further efforts to promote coordinated
economic policies.
   The source said no dramatic announcements of policy changes would
be coming from the post-inauguration meeting.
   ``The meeting is to give (Brady) a chance to reassure his
counterparts of policies under a Bush administration,'' the source
said.
   The meeting is expected to take place in late February or early
March.
   Both Bush and Brady have been forced since the election to
reassure jittery financial markets that the new administration has
no secret plan to drive down the value of the dollar as a way of
curing the nation's huge trade deficits.
   Bush has insisted that as president he will pursue the same
policy of coordinated efforts to stabilize the value of the dollar
that the Reagan administration has been pursuing since February 1987.

<HEAD>States Should Move Quickly To Close Insolvent Insurers, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State regulators should move more quickly to
liquidate insolvent insurers to minimize public harm and avoid
costly failures similar to those that have hit the savings and loan
industry, an insurance group recommended Tuesday.
   ``What we need today is a new determination by the regulators to
act swiftly,'' said Martin J. McFadden Jr., president of the
National Association of Insurance Brokers.
   ``In the real world, there are significant pressures which
encourage regulatory delay rather than fast action against insolvent
underwriters,'' McFadden told a National Press Club news conference.
   But ``the consequences for policyholders, regulators and insurers
are far more severe than they would be if regulators acted
quickly,'' he said.
   The study, ``Managing Insurer Insolvency,'' was prepared by
Stewart Economics Inc. for the NAIB. The association represents 58
international, regional and local firms that write more than 75
percent of the property-casualty insurance policies for business and
industry in the United States.
   ``Many years ago, the mission (of regulation) was to prevent
insolvencies. It was achieved by government support for cartel
pricing which covered the costs of the weak,'' the study said.
``Keeping weak insurers afloat was an accepted cost of the cartel
system.''
   But Richard Stewart, one of the study's authors and the former
superintendent of insurance of New York State, contended that
``insolvency is a result of regulation.''
   Stewart said regulators operating on principles from the
industry's ``cartel legacy'' too often focus on heroic rescues of
insolvent insurers acting ``as a doctor who needs to keep the
patient alive'' instead of allowing failing companies to go under.
   ``This won't get at the guts of the problem ... taking an
insurance company out of the marketplace before it does something
awful to save itself,'' Stewart said.
   Barbara Stewart, a co-author of the study, said changing
liability rules, catastrophic coverage, insurance of the most risky
situations and events and increased competition also were
contributing to the worsening insurer insolvency problem.
   There have been about 58 property-casualty insurer insolvencies
since 1983 according to the NAIB.
   Citing a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation begun
this fall into the failure of Mission Insurance Co. in California _
which is estimated to cost $1.5 billion _ McFadden warned that
investigations of other failed insurers will continue next year.
   ``There appears to be growing concern among federal policymakers
that the insurance insolvency problem could parallel the savings and
loan insolvency problem if regulatory policies remain unchanged,''
McFadden said.
   ``There are disturbing similarities in the insurance industry and
S&Ls, where fraud and mismanagement resulted in the collapse of the
system,'' said John Chesson, counsel to the House subcommittee
overseeing the insurance insolvency investigations.
   Chesson said Mission's insolvency and two others the committee is
investigating, Integrity Insurance Co. in New Jersey and the Los
Angeles-based Transit Insurance Co., represent ``the three largest
failures ever in the history of insurance.''

   The hard-fought contest for Senate majority
leader, marked by months of cajoling, concluded Tuesday in an aura
of eloquence and cordiality.
   Maybe it was the hallowed walls of the Old Senate Chamber, used
officially from 1810 to 1859, and still employed occasionally for
secret meetings like this.
   Sens. George Mitchell of Maine and Bennett Johnston of Louisiana
sat together and chatted as they awaited the opening gavel of the
third competitor, Democratic conference secretary Daniel Inouye of
Hawaii.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the vice presidential nominee, won a
standing ovation from his Democratic colleagues and praise from
nearly every speaker.
   And when the first ballot for majority leader put Mitchell one
short of the 28 he needed to win, Johnston and Inouye rose to their
feet as one to call for a Mitchell victory by acclamation.
   ``It was extraordinarily cordial,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va. ``There was not one instance of rancor or disconsonance.''
   ``There was no tension at all,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn.
   ``There were some extraordinarily good talks,'' said Sen. Wyche
Fowler, D-Ga.
   Seven people spoke on behalf of the three majority leader
contenders _ two for Mitchell, two for Inouye and three for
Johnston. ``I, of course, was the shortest,'' quipped Fowler, a
Mitchell partisan.
   Outside the chamber, a handful of security officers were charged
with keeping order among crowds of reporters, photographers and
lobbyists stationed at the imposing mahogany Ohio Clock, presented
by the state when it became a state.
   The eagle-topped clock ticked on for more than two hours, and a
grinning Mitchell finally emerged, flanked by his vanquished rivals
and the rest of the Democratic leadership.
   Later, surrounded by reporters in his office, Mitchell took a
series of congratulatory phone calls from President Reagan,
President-elect George Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle.
   In a jovial conversation with Bush, Mitchell told him ``it is a
welcome sign of your good judgment that you have chosen to live in
Maine even though you didn't have the good fortune to be born
there.''
   On a more serious note, Mitchell told Bush: ``I want very much to
work with you. We've got serious problems and challenges and we want
to deal with them in cooperation with you.''
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kansas, re-elected Senate minority leader on
Tuesday, said he would be able to work well with Mitchell. The
sometimes caustic Kansan said a more confrontational approach
``would be unaccustomed to a senator like myself.''

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case on Tuesday
upheld two of the central charges against Oliver L. North but
dismissed the third as a ``purely cumulative count'' that would only
confuse jurors.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell refused to dismiss the two
charges of conspiracy to defraud the government and theft of
government property against the former National Security Council
aide that arose from the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds
to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``The indictment clearly alleges a conspiracy which involved
concealing the very existence of the profits of the enterprise from
the start and hiding from Congress information relating to the
conspirators' assistance for the Contras,'' Gesell said.
   ``Its purpose depended on deceit from the start, and acts of
concealment were actually part of the commission of the substantive
crime,'' the judge said of North's contention the conspiracy count
was invalid because it alleged more than one criminal conspiracy.
   But Gesell dismissed a wire fraud charge, saying it ``is, in many
ways, a cumulative count'' that would only create ``substantial
confusion in the minds of the jurors.''
   All three charges also were filed against North's co-defendants:
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers
Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   Gesell's dismissal of the wire fraud count suggests that charge
may also be dropped against the other defendants, who are scheduled
to be tried separately.
   The judge refused to dismiss six charges that North lied to
congressional committees that investigated whether he and other
members of the National Security Council staff were covertly
providing military aid to the Contras in violation of the law.
   So far, Gesell has ruled on 34 of North's 37 pre-trial motions.
He has dismissed only two of the 16 original counts against North,
including a charge that the retired Marine lieutenant colonel
obstructed an FBI probe of the installation of a security fence
around his Great Falls, Va. home.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh consented to dismissal of
that charge.
   Gesell has yet to rule on three pending defense motions to
dismiss on other legal ground two charges that North lied to
Congress.
   The judge rejected as ``misplaced'' North's argument that the
Boland Amendments passed by Congress banning direct U.S. military
aid to the Contras were unconstitutional and did not apply to the
National Security Council.
   Although the White House expressed doubt about whether the
amendments prohibited the NSC from aiding the Contras, Gesell noted
that President Reagan signed the provisions into law and agreed to
comply with them.
   North's ``understanding as to the constitutionality of Boland in
no way affords an excuse for his alleged misconduct or entitled him
to obstruct the way the government was, in fact, functioning,''
Gesell said.
   In a related ruling on charges that North falsely assured
congressional committees he was complying with the Boland Amendment,
Gesell noted that only the president, not North or other White House
staffers, could ``assert executive privilege'' and refuse to answer
Congress' questions about foreign affairs.
   ``Deliberate falsifications are another matter, and North did not
himself have executive privilege,'' Gesell said.
   ``North did not simply refuse to answer; he affirmatively
deceived Congress, and there is not the slightest suggestion in
North's papers that the president instructed North to give false
information,'' he said.
   As he did several weeks ago, the judge chided North for offering
a ``disdainful view of government'' by arguing he had a right to lie
to Congress.
   ``The thought that any one of the hundreds or thousands of
persons working for the president can affirmatively and
intentionally mislead Congress when it weeks information ... is
unacceptable on its face,'' Gesell said.
   ``North seems to state that executive branch officials and their
staffs habitually and properly lie to Congress,'' the judge said.
   He refused to delete from the indictment allegations that North
violated the Boland Amendment and two executive orders that
prohibited government agencies, except the CIA, from engaging in
covert operations without a presidential finding.
   In doing so, Gesell rejected North's contention that the major
conspiracy count could not be tried in court because it involved
foreign policy questions that a court could not consider.
   ``The president's conduct in implementing his foreign policy or
intelligence functions is not being brought under scrutiny,'' Gesell
said. ``Rather, it is what he did and authorized or didn't authorize
that controls the outcome'' of the case.
   The Boland Amendment is named for its author, Rep. Edward Boland,
D-Mass.
   In a separate ruling Tuesday, the judge refused to exclude Walsh
and his associates from closed hearings set to begin Wednesday on
North's objections to editing 350 classified documents the
prosecution wants to use as evidence.
   He said that excluding prosecutors ``would alter the purpose of
the hearing and result in further and wholly unnecessary delay'' of
the trial, which he previously indicated may start in late January.
   North's lawyers had not given a reason for seeking to bar Walsh
and his associates from the hearing. But they would likely have
argued that Walsh would get an unfair look at defense strategy by
attending the proceedings.
   Gesell last week ordered the closed proceedings to consider
North's objections to deleting references to countries, foreign
officials and U.S. intelligence operatives from classified documents
Walsh wants to use as evidence.
   The judge directed North to explain during the hearings why the
material he doesn't want deleted from the documents would help him
defend charges of diverting more than $12 million in U.S.-Iran
arms-sale proceeds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   North has objected to virtually every deletion proposed by Walsh
from the 350 documents, which cover 1,000 to 2,000 pages. Walsh has
received government permission to use the documents as exhibits in a
public trial as long as the sensitive information is deleted.
   The prosecution contends that North's objections and his proposal
to disclose 40,000 additional pages of secret government documents
is merely an attempt to provoke dismissal of the case.

<HEAD>FDA OKs Blood Test Kits for Virus Linked With Rare Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved three tests for a blood-borne virus linked to a rare form
of leukemia and recommended that blood banks begin screening for it.
   The development has been expected for some time and blood banks
have started preliminary planning to test for HTLV-I, short for
human T-lymphotropic virus type I.
   The disease, called adult T-cell lymphoma, may appear in a small
number of people 20 years to 40 years after they become infected
with the virus, the FDA said.
   A Red Cross study has suggested that about two of every 10,000
blood donors carry the virus. However, scientists believe only about
1 percent of those infected develop the disease.
   By contrast, HIV _ the virus that causes AIDS _ acts much more
quickly, sometimes leading to full-stage disease in two or three
years. Moreover, researchers increasingly are concerned that a very
high percentage of those infected with the virus, perhaps nearly
all, eventually will devlop AIDS.
   All donated blood is already tested for AIDS and several other
diseases, including two types of hepatitis.
   In addition to the rare leukemia, HTLV-I also is associated with
an even more rare degenerative neurologic disease called tropical
spastic paraparesis.
   ``Based on current data we know that HTLV-I is rare in the United
States, but to be on the safe side, FDA has recommended blood
screening,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said. ``If blood tests
positive, it will not be entered into the blood supply.''
   Although the FDA technically is only recommending screening for
HTLV-I for the time being, that recommendation has great weight
since the agency has the regulatory authority to require such
testing if blood banks do not act on their own.
   The Red Cross already has announced it will begin screening blood
donations for HTLV-I when the test kits became available for
widespread use.
   John Horrell, a spokesman for the 8,000-member American
Association of Blood Banks, said Tuesday his group is awaiting
expected guidelines from the FDA on recommended testing procedures.
   While the association has not taken a formal position, it already
has distributed tentative guidelines to its members, and, Horrell
said, ``My sense is there will be testing.''
   He said it was difficult to predict how soon testing will be
instituted nationwide.
   Three groups licensed to produce test kits are E.I. du Pont de
Nemours & Co. of Wilmington, Del., in collaboration with Biotech
Research Laboratories of Rockville, Md.; Abbott Laboratories of
North Chicago, Ill.; and Cellular Products of Buffalo, N.Y.
   Ken Koziak, a spokesman for Du Pont, said the company ``will be
shipping product tomorrow'' and that the three companies licensed to
market the test can easily meet demand.
   However, it is likely to be a month or so before test kids will
reach every blood bank in the nation.
   The new test is expected to be a little more expensive than the
main AIDS screening test, which averages about $1.50 per kit.

   The immediate sequence of events leading to the U.S. refusal of a
visa to PLO chief Yasser Arafat began Nov. 15 in Algiers, when the
Palestinians declared an independent state.
   They also issued a political statement widely interpreted as an
implicit recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism, which
would represent a significant move toward moderation by the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Although the Palestine National Council did not specifically
recognize Israel's right to exist, it accepted three U.N.
resolutions that do so.
   It did not say directly that terrorism would be abandoned, but
committed the PLO to the ``Cairo declaration'' of 1985, which limits
attacks to ``military targets'' in Israel and the occupied
territories. Military targets are not defined further.
   Israel described it all as ``double talk'' that contained neither
recognition nor a renunciation of terrorism.
   A nearly year-old rebellion against Israeli occupation in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which has cost the lives of more than than
300 Palestinians, provided the impetus for declaring an independent
state.
   After the independence declaration and political statement were
issued by the Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature, Arafat said the next move toward Middle East peace was
up to the United States.
   Washington has made recognition of Israel and renunciation of
terrorism conditions for dealing tth the PLO.
   The Reagan administration said the Palestinian statement
contained ``positive elements'' but rejected the declaration of
independence. It said the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
must be determined by negotiations with Israel, which captured them
from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   Major sources of confusion about what the Palestinians said in
the political declaration are its vague construction and the fact
that it was issued only in Arabic.
   It says a ``comprehensive political settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict'' must be reached in a framework that includes
``U.N. resolultions _ the last of which were U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 605, 607 an 608,'' which denounce Israeli deportation of
Palestinians from the occupied territories.
   As a category, U.N. resolutions include the General Assembly's
equating of Zionism with racism.
   The Palestine National Council also called for an international
peace conference ``on the basis of U.N. Security Council Resolutions
242 and 338,'' thus implicitly recognizing Israel.
   Resolution 242, passed in 1967, calls for Israel to withdraw from
occupied territories in return for from territories occupied in the
recent conflict in return for the ``right to live in peace within
secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of
force.'' Resolution 338 provides for implementation of 242.
   In its declaration of independence, the council cited General
Assembly Resolution 181 of 1947, which provides for separate Arab
and Jewish states in Palestine.
   Many Arab and Islamic nations recognized the new Palestinian
state in the first days after it was declared, and Third World
nations began to join the list.
   Western European governments generally approved what they
described as the more moderate Palestinian position, but did not
grant diplomatic recognition.
   Protests and strikes in increased among the 1.5 million
Palestinians in the occupied territories. The Israeli army imposed
curfews and other restrictions in an attempt curb celebrations of
the independence declaration.
   On Nov. 16, the State Department said the Algiers political
declaration fell short of U.S. conditions for dealing with the PLO.
   Two days later, the Soviet Union recognized the proclamation of
an independent Palestinian state in a careful announcement that said
full diplomatic ties were not included. When asked whether that
amounted to recognition, the deputy foreign minister replied, ``In
essence.''
   The statement appeared to be an attempt to express continued
support for the PLO without alienating Israel, with which Moscow has
become more cordial recently.
   Egypt, the only Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with Israel,
recognized the new state on Nov. 20. China also extended recognition
on that day.
   Arafat said on Nov. 22 the United States had agreed to grant him
a visa to address the U.N. General Assembly in New York during a
debate on Palestinian issues scheduled to begin Dec. 1. The United
States said no application had been received.
   An English-language daily published in Lebanon, the Middle East
Reporter, said Thursday that Arafat had declared a moratorium on
attacks on Israel from Lebanon as part of the effort to promote the
declaration of a Palestinian state.
   On Friday in Tunis, Tunisia, where the PLO has its headquarters,
it applied for a visa at the U.S. consulate.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz issued a two-page statement
the next day rejecting the visa request.
   He said the United States ``has convincing evidence that PLO
elements have engaged in terrorism against Americans and others.''
Arafat, as PLO chairman, ``knows of, condones, and lends support to
such acts'' and is ``an accessory to such terrorism,'' the secretary
said.
   Israel applauded the decision but was the only government in the
world that did. Allies and friends of the United States urged a
change of heart.
   Critics even included the British government of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, the Reagan administration's staunchest ally. A
Foreign Office spokesman said: ``Britain would have liked to hear
Arafat confirm in New York'' that the PLO recognizes Israel and
``has renounced terrorism.''
   Arab nations said Monday the General Assembly debate would be
moved to Geneva unless the United States granted the visa within 48
hours. The United States said its decision was ``firm and final''
and consented to moving the meeting.
   On Tuesday, the assembly postponed the debate. A senior Arab
diplomat said privately it probably would begin Dec. 13 or 14 in
Geneva.
   Carl-August Fleischhauer, senior U.N. legal counsel, said the
United States was violating the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters
Agreement, which requires the host country to provide visas for
people invited by the United Nations.
   The agreement says ``federal, state or local authorities of the
United States shall not impose any impediments to transit to or from
the headquarters district of representatives of members or officials
of the United Nations, or of specialized agencies (or)
representatives of non-governmental organizations recognized by the
United Nations for the for the purpose of consultation.''
   In refusing the visa, the State Department relied on a paragraph
in a U.S. law passed on ratification, which is not part of the
agreement.
   It says: ``Nothing in the agreement shall be construed as in any
way diminishing, abridging, or weakening the right of the United
States to safeguard its own security and completely to control the
entrance of aliens into any territory of the United States other
than the headquarters district and its immediate vicinity ... and
such areas as it is reasonably necessary to traverse in transit
between the same and foreign countries.''

<HEAD>Former Secretary Says Pentagon Already `Bankrupt'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara
called Tuesday for cancellation of a major U.S. bomber project and
two aircraft carrier groups to trim spending by an already
``bankrupt'' Pentagon.
   He said the budget will have to be cut $150 billion to $200
billion dollars over five years and the department, itself,
restructured.
   McNamara, who was defense secretary from 1961 until 1968, said he
sympathized with President-elect George Bush's unnamed choice to run
the Pentagon.
   ``There is just no question about it,'' he told the Arms Control
Association at the private group's annual luncheon meeting. ``The
Defense Department is bankrupt. They have on contract and plan for
contract more weapons than any reasonable level of a budget will
support for the next five years.''
   McNamara said cutting the budget and restructuring the Pentagon
``is going to be one hell of a job, particularly if you do it
without reducing security.''
   In fact, he said, ``it's damn near impossible and perhaps
politically impossible. You are going to have to cut two carrier
groups, either the B-1 or B-2. You are going to have to do all kinds
of things that are going to be politically unpopular.''
   In his speech, McNamara urged completion of a strategic arms
reduction treaty with the Soviet Union designed to slash U.S. and
Soviet arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons by 30 to 50 percent.
   ``The treaty can be completed in a year or less,'' he said.
   But, McNamara said, arguments raised against the treaty could
cause the process to unravel. He cited the claim the cutbacks would
make remaining U.S. land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles
more vulnerable to Soviet attack and that the numerical advantage in
Soviet ground forces would pose a greater danger to Western Europe.
   ``If the attacks continue they can prove to be decisive and we
will lose the marvelous opportunity to reduce weapons and increase
stability,'' McNamara said.

<TEXT>
   The publisher of the newly banned Harper's magazine
joined about 200 prominent Britons on Tuesday to accuse Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of violating civil liberties.
   John MacArthur, president and publisher of the American magazine,
distributed copies of the banned December issue at the meeting,
which was convened to unveil a charter calling for an U.S.-style
constitution and bill of rights.
   The Harper's issue contains excerpts from the memoirs of Anthony
Cavendish, a former officer of the MI6 intelligence service, which
British newspapers are barred by a court order from publishing.
   The government says distribution of the magazine, which sells 200
copies monthly in Britain, would violate the injunction. It says it
is trying to uphold the principle that an intelligence operative,
bound to secrecy for life, cannot publish memoirs.
   ``We object to censorship in Britain,'' said MacArthur.
   He added that Harper's published the Cavendish memoirs as a
``cautionary tale'' to alert Americans to secrecy moves by the
Reagan administration. ``Believe me there is no cause for smugness
in America,'' he told reporters.
   The charter accused Mrs. Thatcher of eroding civil liberties
during her nearly 10 years in power. ``A process is underway which
endangers many of the freedoms we have had ... and is now gathering
momentum,'' it said.
   It indirectly referred to her anti-union legislation, limitations
on suspects' right to silence, and a ban on broadcast interviews
with groups supporting terrorism. The latter was directed at Sinn
Fein, the legal wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   Signers included novelists Margaret Drabble, John Fowles and
Salman Rushdie; pop musicians Peter Gabriel and Pete Townshend;
playwrights Harold Pinter and Michael Frayn; actors Julie Christie,
John Cleese, Glenda Jackson and Dame Peggy Ashcroft; and Nobel
Prize-winning scientists Sir James Black and Professor Maurice
Wilkins.
   But while blaming Mrs. Thatcher's government for failing to
defend civil liberties, the charter representatives said the problem
was rooted in the British political system.
   ``It's not an attack on this particular government, although this
government with its overriding parliamentary majority has shown how
any government _ without checks and balances, without any chance of
going to the courts or people _ may destroy liberties,'' said
Geoffrey Robertson, a leading civil rights lawyer and key figure in
the campaign.
   ``Our unwritten constitution is merely conventions, winks and
nods, elbowing, which, if the government unilaterally decides, can
be snuffed out like that,'' said Robertson.
   He said he was also concerned that because former British
colonies still look to Britain for legal precedence, ``we're seeing
British law becoming supportive of repressive governments.''
   The charter calls for a written constitution which enshrines
civil liberties in a bill of rights, establishes freedom of
information and open government, makes an electoral system of
proportional representation, turns the House of Lords into an
elected body, provides legal remedies for abuses of power, and
guarantees equal distribution of power between local and national
bodies.

<TEXT>
   Soviet space scientists declared a brilliant
success the unmanned maiden voyage of the space shuttle Buran, and
are planning a much longer second mission, Tass said Tuesday.
   ``The previous program was brilliantly performed; when the craft
came to a halt on the runway its time deviation from the program
reached only one second, while the deviation of the Buran's axis
from that of the runway was only 1.5 meters,'' the official news
agency reported.
   Only five of the 39,000 heat-protecting tiles broke away during
the 3-hour, 20-minute flight Nov. 15 and the spacecraft, whose name
means Snowstorm in Russian, successfully maneuvered in bad weather,
Tass said.
   It quoted Gen. German Titov as saying: ``We deliberately refused
to postpone the launch and wait for ideal conditions. The value of
the flight is that its program included the maximum sum of real and
rather difficult tasks.''
   Tass said the landing took place in relatively high winds and
thick clouds.
   Officials have said the shuttle's second flight also will be
unmanned. No precise information on its length was available.
   Cosmonauts on another Soviet space mission, a joint project
including French cosmonaut Jean-Loup Chretien, began working aboard
the orbiting space station Mir on Tuesday, a day after docking their
Soyuz TM-7 capsule.
   Chretien will return with Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov, who
have set an endurance record and will have been in space a full year
when they make the descent Dec. 21. Commander Alexander Volkov and
Sergei Krikalev, who went into space with the Frenchman, will remain
on the Mir until April.
   Tass said one project, designed by French scientists, is to make
a detailed study of the cardio-vascular system in space flight,
using ultra sound to evaluate blood flow.

   The departing head of the federal health
bureauracy urged his colleagues on Tuesday to keep AIDS from
becoming a political issue as they attempt to build support for
fighting the disease in the years ahead.
   ``We have treated AIDS simply and solely as the public health
crisis it is,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen
told a gathering of top federal officials involved in fighting the
epidemic.
   ``Politically, our goal must be to build a consensus to keep the
focus on public health,'' said Bowen.
   ``At the same time our political actions must be consistent both
with the available knowledge and the proper protection of the public
health, we also must take care not to make the AIDS crisis a
referendum on lifestyles, or a chance to push liberal or
conservative agendas.''
   Bowen, a physician and former two-time governor of Indiana, has
stated that he plans to return to Indiana and spend his retirement
years tending his garden when a new administration takes over Jan.
20.
   His remarks to more than 200 federal officials convened for a
two-day conference had the tone of an informal farewell to the
Public Health Service troops engaged in the struggle against AIDS.
   ``People with AIDS should never be treated like political
footballs or, on the other hand, political prizes,'' Bowen told
them. ``We must never broker the lives of people with AIDS for
political advantage.
   ``Also the AIDS crisis is not to be viewed as a battlefield for
career advancement or an opportunity to win awards,'' he said.
   Without naming names, Bowen said some people ``have helped to
foster deep divisions which are counterproductive and destructive to
the cooperation and partnership necessary to successfully combat
this epidemic.''
   He said the Bush administration will face many difficult policy
questions _ for example, whether distributing clean needles to
addicts might be warranted in restricting the spread of AIDS, even
though such a program ``may send the wrong message that drug use can
be made safe.''
   Another troublesome question is what to do about a pregnant woman
who shares needles with other addicts infected with AIDS and thus
threatens her baby with the infection, he said.
   ``What action should the state legitimately take to protect the
baby?'' Bowen asked. ``Here we have to balance rights and decide how
far the state can go to protect a baby threatened by the virus.''
   He said many other public health concerns are equally complex,
``but those in leadership positions are going to have to face up to
these differences of opinion and make the tough choices.''
   Losing sight of the need to keep public health policy separated
from liberal or conservative political agendas ``opens the door to
danger,'' said Bowen.
   For example he cited the work of scientists at the National
Institutes of Health.
   ``The American people have long had a high regard for what's
being done at NIH, and rightly so,'' he said. ``But what would
happen if one political party twisted scientific information to meet
a social agenda or to advance political fortune? Then, people would
be justified in questioning the accuracy of that information,
leaving doubt as to the real facts.''
   He said there is already ``a temendous amount of denial now.''
   ``Many people want to believe that they are immune to AIDS, or
that somehow this can't happen to them,'' he said. ``If scientific
information were altered to suit our own political purposes, we run
the very real risk of creating even more doubt, dissension and
disbelief. the ultimate result could be the continued spread of the
virus, perhaps at an accelerated rate.''

<HEAD>SEC Proposes To Tighten Rules on Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Tuesday proposed tightening the rules that govern stock trading by
corporate officers and other so-called insiders.
   Since 1934, federal regulations have required corporate officers
and directors to disclose publicly whenever they buy or sell stock
in their own company. The commission, by a 3-0 vote, invited public
comment for 90 days on what would be the first major change to the
rules since they were established to prevent ``insiders'' from
gaining advantage from information not available to all stockholders.
   Corporate officers are supposed to report to the SEC within 10
days of acquiring insider status. They must file subsequent reports
in the first 10 days of the month after they buy or sell stock.
   According to a survey by the SEC staff, 43 percent of the reports
have been filed late so far this year. An unknown number of insiders
never filed at all.
   Under the proposal, companies would be required to list violators
in their annual reports and proxy statements.
   Insiders also would be required to report trades in
exchange-listed options as well as stocks.
   A new and narrower definition of insider is being proposed to
include only chief executives and other policy-making officers.
   And the commmission is asking for public comment on whether it
should seek authorization from Congress to impose fines against
violators. Currently, its only option is to seek a court order
forcing compliance.

   A toddler's abdomen was virtually replaced
Tuesday in a rare five-organ transplant that doctors said was the
3-year-old girl's only chance for survival.
   Rolandrea Dodge of Fruitland, N.M., received a new liver,
pancreas, stomach, small intestine and a portion of a large
intestine. The young donor was not identified. Rolandrea's spleen
also was removed.
   ``The patient is doing fine,'' said Dr. Satoru Todo, who headed
the surgical team at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Todo said the 16{-hour operation, which is considered
experimental, went smoothly except for one episode when the chilled
organs inserted into her body lowered her temperature dramatically
and her heart stopped beating for about a minute.
   He said surgeons restarted her heart with cardio-pulmonary
resuscitation techniques.
   Todo said Rolandrea's heart was functioning normally following
surgery, and she was moving her hands and legs. Her liver also was
producing bile, a positive sign, he said.
   She was in critical condition in the hospital's intensive care
unit after the operation, which ended at 3:40 p.m. Tuesday.
   ``The prognosis is very difficult to say, but I'm expecting it to
go well,'' Todo said.
   Five organs have been transplanted simultaneously only once
before. Last November, Tabatha Foster, 3{, of Madisonville, Ky.,
underwent the same operation at the same hospital. She died six
months later of a blood infection.
   Tabatha survived longer than any of the other three people in the
United States who had abdominal transplants involving two or more
organs.
   ``They (doctors) may have gone ahead with a little more
confidence knowing how far Tabatha succeeded,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Sue Cardillo.
   Rolandrea, who is known as Rolly, was born with an incurable
disease called intractable secretory diarrhea, which prevented her
intestines from absorbing food and liquids. She had to be fed
intravenously, although she was allowed occasional nibbles of candy,
potatoes and other solid food.
   Aside from brief outings, Rolly has spent her entire life in
hospitals.
   The girl's liver began failing about three months ago as a result
of her high-protein intravenous feedings, and her skin became
jaundiced.
   She received a pancreas and stomach in addition to intestines and
a liver because it is easier to implant a large portion of the
abdominal tract all at once.
   Rolandrea arrived in October to be evaluated for transplant. She
was accompanied by her parents, Branden and Cyndi Dodge, who also
have two sons. Her parents were with her before she went into
surgery.
   Doctors in New Mexico said she wouldn't survive long without a
transplant.
   Doctors began administering an experimental drug Nov. 9 in hopes
of allowing her intestines to absorb food and liquids, but it was
unsuccessful, Ms. Cardillo said. ``That was really the last
available treatment option,'' she said.
   Dodge, 27, a coal miner, said it was difficult deciding whether
to allow the transplant, but ``it's the only hope that we've got
left.''
   ``We don't have any doubts,'' he said. ``It's just the way our
Indian people are. That's just the way they taught us, try not to
think negative about things, it's going to work out.''

<HEAD>Justice To Review DEA Drug Seizure Practices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Tuesday it will
review a Drug Enforcement Administration practice of sometimes
arranging for local police to make well-publicized seizures of drugs
brought into the United States under the control of DEA operatives.
   Associate Attorney General Francis Keating, the No. 3 official in
the Justice Department, plans to meet with DEA officials to discuss
the matter, said Loye Miller, a department spokesman.
   The meeting stems from a Houston Chronicle story Sunday which
said the DEA had arranged at least two drug seizures by state or
local authorities in the Houston area to generate false news reports
which would protect the identity of DEA undercover operatives.
   The undercover operatives sometimes pose as middlemen and ship
loads of narcotics into the United States for South American
druglords.
   The DEA on occasion then arranges for local law enforcement
agents to seize the incoming drug shipments in an attempt to
insulate the operatives from disclosure, said DEA sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   In addition to keep the drugs off the street, the practice also
is designed to allow the DEA to continue criminal investigations
aimed at top-level narcotics figures, the sources said.
   John Seigenthaler, president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, said it is misleading to the press and public for the DEA
to initiate what becomes a highly publicized drug seizure by state
and local police when the shipment has in fact been controlled by
the DEA.
   ``I understand they have to find some way to protect the lives of
the people and the security of the operation, but when they engage
in subterfuge or creating situations that really don't exist, they
have to expect that sooner or later people are going to find out,''
said Seigenthaler. ``They have to find some other way to protect
people and the security of the operation.''
   In a statement, the DEA said it is not the agency's policy ``to
lie or mislead the media, nor is it our policy to misrepresent
information to the media. No techniques have ever been used or will
ever be used that are designed to out and out mislead or lie to the
media or public.''
   But ``to preserve the integrity'' of ongoing probes which often
involve wiretaps, undercover operations and money laundering, and to
assure that the highest level traffickers are eventually prosecuted,
``we cannot release all of the details of these events as they
occur,'' the DEA statement added.
   The techniques used to prevent drugs from reaching market become
public knowledge at the time of prosecution, the statement said.
   The Houston Chronicle cited an instance in 1984 in which DEA
agents helped smuggle 952 pounds of cocaine into the country, then
abandoned their van at a prearranged roadblock set up by the Texas
Department of Public Safety. DPS alerted news reporters that
troopers had found a cache of drugs which they described at the time
as one of Texas' largest seizures.
   A DEA case agent, describing the arrangement in testimony during
a bond hearing for a man arrested in the operation, testified that
``we had a prearranged setup arranged with the Texas Department of
Public Safety where they would stage a traffic stop and seize the
contraband.''
   In a second instance, on Sept. 29 of this year, said the
Chronicle, a load of cocaine was planted in an abandoned car and
left to be discovered by deputies with the Harris County, Texas,
sheriff's department, who notified reporters.
   DEA spokesman Maurice Hill declined to discuss the Sept. 29
seizure, but denied that the cocaine had been planted in the car.
Hill also denied that the agency had been in control of the Sept. 29
shipment.

<TEXT>
   Lyndon H. LaRouche's political movement
was buying expensive Virginia properties at a time when millions of
dollars in loans to his organizations were not being repaid, the
political maverick's conspiracy trial was told Tuesday.
   Richard Welsh, a LaRouche aide, said a LaRouche real estate
company spent about $4 million on land for a security training
facility, for a summer camp for children of LaRouche employees and a
farm where LaRouche and his wife Helga live when in the United
States.
   During the same period, around May 1986, LaRouche wrote Elizabeth
Sexton, who was seeking repayment of nearly $113,000 in loans, that
she could not be repaid because no discretionary funds were
available.
   LaRouche and six associates are on trial in U.S. District Court
on charges that they conspired to defraud investors by not repaying
more than $30 million in loans that they made to LaRouche
organizations.
   LaRouche alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service by failing to declare as income personal and
household services provided him by his organizations.
   Welsh, who received immunity from prosecution, testified that $5
million of the loan amount eventually was repaid.
   Welsh, who was assistant treasurer of LaRouche's 1984
presidential campaign and still works for him, said the campaign
devised a plan to pay back $4 million it borrowed for that campaign
but that the repayment system broke down. He said the campaign still
owes between $1.5 million and $2 million.
   Welsh said that when lenders complained about non-repayment, the
local campaign organizer who originally secured the money was to
attempt to have the loan forgiven or a new schedule of payments
worked out.
   But Welsh said the system did not work well, because some
organizers never got back to the lender and others made an
``insufficient effort.'' In some cases, he said, lenders were told
something would be done when no action was planned.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson asked Welsh if lenders were
told in effect, ``the check is in the mail'' when no check had been
issued.
   ``Yes,'' Welsh replied.
   Under cross-examination from LaRouche attorney Odin Anderson,
Welsh sought to distance LaRouche from day-to-day operations of his
organizations.
   ``He is the founder and leading thinker, the primary person who
defines broad policies ... general objectives and political goals,''
Welsh said. ``I don't recall him involved in day-to-day financial
operations.''
   Welsh also told the jury that in September 1986 he launched
``Project Apollo'' to gain ``control of the loan situation.'' He
said the project involved a combination of repayments, requests for
forgiveness of loans and attempts to have promised interest rates
lowered or payments stretched out.
   He said the operation came to a sudden halt when federal and
state law enforcement authorities raided LaRouche's Leesburg, Va.,
headquarters Oct. 6, 1986, and ``seized just about every scrap of
paper having to do with any financial record.''
   Despite the raid, Welsh testified, virtually all the 3,500 people
with loans outstanding had been contacted and total debt by early
1987 was reduced by $1.5 million.
   In addition, Welsh said that in April 1987 the three main
LaRouche organizations that owed lenders money were placed in
involuntary bankruptcy, in a government action that froze the
groups' financial transactions.
   The final disruption to the repayment campaign, Welsh said, came
when several banks froze LaRouche organization accounts after it
became public knowledge that a federal grand jury in Boston was
investigating the movement's financial dealings.
   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.
The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of
credit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization.
Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years
in prison and fines of $3.25 million for LaRouche.
   The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail
fraud and conspiracy charges, which cover the years 1983 to 1987.
   In the tax conspiracy count, the federal grand jury charged that
LaRouche has not filed a federal income tax return since at least
1979.
   On trial with LaRouche are his chief fund-raiser, William Wertz;
his legal adviser, Edward Spannaus; and four fund-raisers: Michael
Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua extended
a truce with guerrillas through the end of December, but said
Tuesday his nation will maintain a state of alert until it sees a
change in U.S. policy.
   Ortega's leftist Sandinista government extends a March 21
cease-fire unilaterally on a monthly basis. The U.S.-backed rebels,
called Contras, say the truce is indefinite and need not be extended.
   Each side has accused the other of violations. Ortega renewed the
charges Tuesday during a news conference at the Nicaraguan
ambassador's residence.
   The truce forbids offensive military action. Ortega denied Contra
claims that soldiers have attacked, and characterized recent army
operations as defensive.
   He is in Mexico City for the Thursday inauguration of
President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari and said he had no plans
to meet Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who will represent the
United States.
   Ortega said he would wait and see what happens when George Bush
is installed in January as president of the United States, but told
the news conference:
   ``While the U.S. government doesn't show a changed attitude
toward Nicaragua, we can't change our own readiness, up to and
including the possibility of invasion by American troops. We are in
constant and permanent alert.''
   Other Nicraguan officials have said they expect a more
``pragmatic'' attitude toward Nicaragua by a Bush administration.
Ortega said he hopes the new administration will accept ``as a
reality that we survived all the efforts of a superpower to destroy
the Nicaraguan revolution.''
   He referred to President Reagan's support for the Contras since
they began fighting eight years ago. Congress has refused to provide
money for weapons since March.
   The Nicaraguan president said the Salinas inauguration gives
Central American presidents a good chance to discuss problems on an
informal basis, and said they should arrange a future meeting
``without preconditions.''
   Presidents Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador, Jose Azcona Hoyo
of Honduras and Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala also are to attend the
inauguration but not Oscar Arias of Costa Rica. Arias won the 1987
Nobel Peace Prize for a Central American peace plan that was agreed
upon Aug. 7, 1987, but has stalled.
   When asked if he would be willing to drop a complaint against
Honduras at the World Court in The Hague, Netherlands, Ortega said:
``We should meet without any preconditions to discuss our problems,
and not only if all our problems are solved.''
   The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a cease-fire agreement
March 23 under which the rebels were to stop fighting in exchange
for democratic reforms in Nicaragua. Both sides suspended offensive
military operations and a formal truce took effect April 1.
   Talks on details of the truce agreement broke off and no
negotiations have been held since September. Most Contra fighters
have left Nicaragua for camps in Honduras.
   Nicaragua accuses Honduras of harboring the rebels and permitting
them to launch operations from Honduran territory. That is the basis
of the World Court action.

<TEXT>
   Dozens of former senior army officials
joined about 10,000 demonstrators in front of Tel Aviv City Hall on
Tuesday to protest draft deferments given to Orthodox yeshiva
students.
   ``The fighters of Israel from all generations are against draft
evasion,'' proclaimed a sign on the speakers' platform set up in
Kings of Israel Square.
   ``Living on somebody else's blood,'' read another sign held aloft
by protesters.
   Speakers told the banner-waving rally that about 19,000
ultra-Orthodox youths were granted deferments in 1988, letting them
postpone army service while they study in yeshivas, or religious
seminaries.
   Shlomo Lahat, mayor of Tel Aviv and a reserve army general, told
the mostly liberal audience it was unfair for ultra-Orthodox parties
to demand Cabinet seats if they supported avoiding national service.
   ``Morally, the state of Israel cannot accept such a thing. It
can't be that they will have only rights and not duty as well,''
said Lahat, a liberal member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc.
   Former Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan, leader of a far-right party
that advocates annexation of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
said ways could be found for yeshiva students to learn the torah and
serve their country at the same time.
   ``The public has to demand of its representatives that existing
standards be changed,'' said Eitan.
   Asked about military exemptions at a meeting of Israeli
journalists Tuesday, Prime Minister Shamir said the agreement with
the Orthodox went back three decades and no plans were under way to
change this informal undertanding.
   He denied rumors that the issue was discussed in Likud's ongoing
talks with four small religious parties, who demanded religious
legislatio in exchange for supporting a Likud-led government.
   Leaders of ultra-Orthodox religious parties denied that yeshiva
students enter seminaries to avoid military service. They say most
eventually wind up in the army.
   However, they say study of the torah and Jewish religious
tradition cannot be limited to specific periods of time.
   Thus, students often miss the compulsory three-year national
service because they exceed the maximum draft age of 26.
   Poet Chaim Hefer, who wrote well-known songs commemorating
Israel's 1948 war of independence, disputed contentions that most
yeshiva students did serve in the army.
   He said that in 1986 only 244 of 17,017 eventually did their
national service. He gave no figures on how many eventually served
in the reserve army. All males up to age 49 must serve up to 62 days
a year in the reserves.
   Hefer said 5,877 students postponed military service in 1970, but
deferments swelled to 12,596 during the Lebanon war and now exceeded
19,000.
   Reserve Col. Dalia Raz, former head of the women's corps, said
religious women should no longer be exempt from military service.
   Religious women are usually required to do a one-year community
service instead of the two-year women's army service, but this is
not enforced.
   A veteran who lost both legs, an arm and an eye in the 1982-85
Lebanon war said, to loud applause, ``I don't understand why I had
to fight and lose my legs, and lose my friends, while someone sits
in school and prays.''
   The veteran, identified as Maoziya, said he would soon be doing a
voluntary one-month tour of reserve duty, and ``if I can go to the
reserves so can they.''

<TEXT>
   One of Claude Monet's famous Impressionist
paintings of waterlilies was bought in London Tuesday night for 5.72
million pounds ($10.53 million) by Japan's Seibu department store.
   Auctioneers Sotheby's did not identify the Swiss seller but said
her husband bought the 1908 painting in Paris in 1946 for 1,500
pounds (then just over $6,000).
   The bidding started at 2 million pounds ($3.68 million) and
jumped in bursts of 200,000 pounds ($368,500) and 300,000 pounds
($552,750) in seconds to its final price in a telephone bid from
Tokyo.
   The sale took place 24 hours after another Japanese store,
Mitsukoshi, paid $38.46 million for Pablo Picasso's ``Acrobat and
Young Harlequin'' at Christie's, to make it the most expensive 20th
century work of art.
   Monet, founder of the Impressionist school of painting, depicted
the waterlilies in his garden at Giverny many times. The painting
sold Tuesday was one of an acclaimed series exhibited in Paris in
1909.

   Government doctors say former Philippines
President Ferdinand Marcos is healthy enough to travel to New York
for arraignment on criminal racketeering charges, a spokesman said
Tuesday.
   ``We received word that Dr. (Francis) Weld decided the president
was healthy enough to travel to New York,'' said spokesman Gemmo
Trinidad. ``But we have received no official report on the matter
and I'm going to have to refer all other questions to our lawyers.
   ``I'm with the president, I see him every day, and it's clear he
is not well, not healthy enough to travel, no matter what the
doctors say,'' Trinidad added.
   Trinidad said he did not know when the 71-year-old exiled leader
was expected to appear and would not disclose Marcos' reaction to
the news.
   Defense lawyers contend Marcos is too frail to make the 10-hour
flight and a hearing is scheduled Monday before Judge John Keenan in
New York.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after military-civilian
revolt ended his 20-year rule and catapulted Corazon Aquino to the
presidency.
   Marcos has been using a wheelchair since he and his wife, Imelda,
were indicted on criminal racketeering charges accusing them of
plundering the Philippines' treasury and stashing much of the money
in the United States.
   Marcos has been treated in the past for eye ailments, chest
pains, severe headaches and calcium deposits near the knee. In
recent appearances, he has also worn a neck brace.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31 in New York
and was released on $5 million bail provided by tobacco heiress
Doris Duke, a close friend who owns a home here.
   Marcos lawyers have said they would ask for medical tests by
``neutral'' physicians if their client was judged by government
physicians as fit to travel, but neither San Francisco lawyer John
Bartko nor Washington attorney Richard Hibey returned phone calls
Tuesday.
   Charles LaBella, assistant U.S. attorney in New York, was quoted
by the Honolulu Star-Bulletin as saying he spoke to Hibey about the
examination results. However, he refused to release the results of
the exam, which was conducted Oct. 31 at Tripler Army Medical Center
here.
   LaBella told The Associated Press the results would not be made
public before Monday's hearing.
   ``There's only one copy and it's in my hands,'' he said.
   At the time of the physical, aides said Marcos was examined for
about three hours by a team of doctors led by Weld, a cardiologist
at New York's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.

   George D. Gould, the No. 3 official in the

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's conservative
Likud bloc and the rival Labor Party moved closer to coalition on
Tuesday and Orthodox religious parties threatened to withdraw
support for Likud.
   Shamir, who offered Labor two of the four most important Cabinet
ministries if it joins the government as a junior partner, said he
would finish forming a government in a few days.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor urged his center-left
party to join a government led by Shamir in order to block Orthodox
demands for religious legislation opposed by Jews abroad.
   Religious parties want a new ``Who Is a Jew'' law that would
accept only conversions to Judaism performed by Orthodox rabbis. The
demand has angered American Jews, most of whom belong to the Reform
or Conservative movements.
   Labor and Likud have been equal partners in a ``national unity''
coalition since the inconclusive election of July 1984. In the Nov.
1 election, Likud won 40 of the 120 Parliament seats and Labor 39.
Right-wing religious parties won 18 seats.
   The ultra-Orthodox party Shas, which made participation in a
Likud government contingent on religious legislation and control of
two ministries, threatened to withdraw its support, party spokesman
Tzvi Yakobson said Tuesday.
   ``Shamir has to promise that we will receive two ministries even
in a broad-based government,'' he said. ``Otherwise we'll see
ourselves free from the agreement with Likud.''
   Israel radio said the threat came after a ``short and stormy''
meeting between Shamir and Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz, the Shas leader, in
which Shamir refused the demands.
   The Council of Torah Sages, spiritual leaders of Agudat Israel,
another Orthodox party, met to discuss the coalition developments
and media reports said one possibility raised was a switch of
support to Labor.
   ``We're not chained in an agreement with Likud,'' Rabbi Abraham
Verdiger, the party leader, said on Israel army radio.
   Shamir could not form a right-wing coalition without Shas and
Agudat Israel, which together have ll seats in the Knesset, Israel's
parliament.
   Some in Likud urged Shamir to accept the Orthodox demand. Cabinet
minister Ariel Sharon, a rival of Shamir's who fears being bypassed
if a deal is struck with Labor, called the law a national necessity.
   Sharon wants to be defense minister, which is one of the senior
posts offered to Labor and probably would be kept by Rabin.
   The other presumably would be the Foreign Ministry held by Shimon
Peres, the Labor Party leader. Peres was prime minister and Shamir
foreign minister in the first two years of the ``national unity''
coalition.

<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Tuesday that two children
should be placed in a foster home rather than with their mother, who
went to jail last year claiming she was hiding them from an abusive
father.
   Rockingham County Superior Court Judge Kenneth McHugh ruled that
the father, Mark Russell Murabito, should have joint custody of the
children with his ex-wife, Jesse Murabito. Previously, Mrs. Murabito
had custody, and her ex-husband had visitation rights.
   Both mother and children have been missing since Murabito, 34, of
Derry, was acquitted earlier this month of a charge of sexual
assault of his daughter, now 5{ years old. After the verdict, he
said he would seek custody of the girl and her 4-year-old brother.
   He also obtained a court order barring Mrs. Murabito from taking
the children out of the state or letting them live with anyone else.
   Mrs. Murabito, 40, of Belmont, went to jail for a week in
February 1987 rather than tell a judge where she hid the children
from their father.
   But she apparently never was served the court order later
obtained by the father, and she and the children have been missing
since the verdict. Through several media interviews, she has said
she is living with a family out of the state in a network that
protects alleged victims of sexual abuse.
   McHugh said Tuesday that Mrs. Murabito, even though she was not
served with the papers, was in enough contact through the media to
know she should not have left New Hampshire. Also, he said, in this
type of case, such an order does not have to be hand-delivered but
can be mailed, which is what the court did.
   McHugh said Mrs. Murabito is violating a visitation agreement she
had with her husband. He also said though he gave them joint
custody, it would be in the children's best interest to stay in a
foster home.
   Murabito initially had asked for joint custody with the state,
and wanted the children to be placed in a foster home.
   Through his lawyer, Murabito said his children have been
brainwashed by their mother and that it would be some time before
they learned to trust him again. He eventually wants full custody,
he said.
   State guardian Neil Reardon said Mrs. Murabito exercised poor
judgment by going into hiding because it is harmful to the
children's mental health.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Uncover Ancient Port</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL HIRSCHHORN_</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAIFA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have uncovered a Bronze Age
port on the Israeli coast with a warehouse stocked with raisins,
peas and olives dating to about 1,200 years before Christ, the
director of the excavation said.
   Professor Michal Artzy of the University of Haifa said in an
interview that the site uncovered at Tel Nami, 12 miles south of the
modern port city of Haifa, could be the oldest man-made port ever
found.
   ``In that period, seafarers tended to hug the coast, and they
used to come into port once every two days for food, so you needed
ports along the shore at set stretches,'' she said. ``There is
little reason for this site to exist, except as a port.''
   Researchers found evidence a channel was cut between the
Mediterranean and a river to form the port, Ms. Artzy said. She said
the port appeared to date to at least 2000 B.C., but further
research was needed to confirm the date.
   Objects uncovered in excavations begun last year include gold and
silver jewelry, bronze sculptures and pottery from ancient
civilizations, Ms. Artzy said.
   Ms. Artzy, who also serves on the staff of the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, was assisted on the dig last summmer by
students from Amherst and from Texas A and M at College Station and
Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
   Foodstuffs found in a warehouse were well preserved because a
fire in about 1200 B.C. apparently caused a roof to collapse,
blocking oxygen from reaching the food and damaging it, she said.
   ``We have whole examples of seeds and raisins, like your mother
used to give you when you were a kid,'' Ms. Artzy said.
   The site apparently was abandoned after the fire and never
resettled.
   She said artifacts found at the site indicated local residents
were very wealthy and that the port was an international trading
center.
   ``These were sea people with a lot of wealth,'' Ms. Artzy said.
She added: ``Whether it was from piracy or this is simply a rich
port, we don't know.''
   The pottery came Egypt, Cyprus, the ancient Greek states of Troy
and Mycenae, and elsewhere, she said.
   She displayed other items that were found, including gold rings
and earrings, a child's gold necklace, silver rings and a
hand-crafted Egyptian ring.
   So many bronze items were found that archaeologists believe a
bronze workshop may have existed at the site.
   Items include one bronze stand for incense burning that is
decorated with pomegranates and another with the figure of a woman.
   ``These are especially valuable because they are unusually well
preserved,'' she said. ``There was obviously a cult aspect to this,
the woman's body and the pomegranate, perhaps a fertility cult.''

<HEAD>Hart Campaign Agrees to Pay Fine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Gary Hart's 1984 presidential
campaign, still trying to clear up its debt-ridden books, must pay a
$12,000 penalty for violations cited in an agreement with the
Federal Election Commission.
   The campaign agreed to pay the civil penalty for violations that
included Hart's use of his personal credit card for campaign
expenses beyond the $50,000 the law says a candidate may contribute
to his campaign.
   In a separate penalty, the FEC cited a violation by the media
firm, Semper-Moser Associates, which agreed to pay $5,000 for
improperly advancing the Hart campaign more than $100,000 worth of
credit.
   Although the firm expected to be paid back the money, and
ironically ended up going to federal court to get $106,000 in back
payment, the credit arrangement with the campaign was illegal
because it was not ``in the ordinary course of business,'' according
to the settlement statement recently made public by the FEC.
   Election law requires that companies conduct relations with
political campaigns in the same manner that they would with any
other entity, to ensure that no special treatment is accorded the
campaigns.
   By agreeing to provide time buys and media services for Hart's TV
commercials on credit, which was not a customary practice,
Semper-Moser was making a corporate contribution, the FEC found.
Corporate donations are banned in federal elections.
   The debts relate to Hart's first race for the presidency. The
former senator from Colorado also entered the 1988 Democratic
primary race, dogged by the debts of his attempt four years earlier.
   While the 1988 campaign ended up solvent, the 1984 effort still
owes more than $1 million to creditors, according to the latest
report on file with the FEC.
   The FEC found that Hart improperly used his personal credit card
for more than $20,000 worth of expenditures above the $50,000
contribution limit he was allowed. While there was an understanding
that the campaign would pay the bills promptly, the payments were
made an average 266 days late, the FEC said.
   Hart's campaign claimed he was unaware of the tardiness and that
all the bills eventually were paid. But the FEC faulted the campaign
for failure to pay in a reasonable time.
   In addition, Hart's campaign acknowledged receiving contributions
from 49 individuals whose donations exceeded the $1,000 per-person
limit imposed by election law. The excess contributions totaled
$19,606, and the improper donations were ultimately refunded.

   Black and Jewish veterans of the civil rights
movement joined hands Tuesday and sang ``We Shall Overcome'' as they
remembered their coalition's martyrs and looked to its future.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, whose presidential library was
host to the two-day conference on black-Jewish relations, called
cooperation between the two groups in the civil rights movement ``an
extraordinary demonstration of common purpose.''
   ``I saw even while I was in the White House some beginnings of
fragmentation in that partnership, and I think your effort to bring
it back together and to derive the great benefits that can flow from
it is indeed a noble effort,'' Carter told conference participants
Tuesday.
   A memorial service honored Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and
Michael Schwerner, civil rights workers killed in Mississippi in
1964, as well as others who were slain, such as Martin Luther King
Jr. Chaney was black, while Goodman and Schwerner were Jewish.
   During the service, Goodman's mother, Carolyn Goodman of New
York, read a brief quotation from King, and Chaney's brother, Ben
Chaney of New York, read from the writings of a Jewish victim of the
Holocaust, Anne Frank.
   The service was prolonged as conference participants brought up
many more names of departed heroes, including many who were neither
black nor Jewish.
   The conference was designed to chronicle black-Jewish cooperation
of the past, but several speakers Tuesday emphasized the coalition's
recent strains and its hopes for reconciliation.
   Conference participant Wilbert Tatum of New York called the
difficulty in black-Jewish relations ``something terrible.''
   ``I think in retrospect it was based more on `not in my back
yard' than any other sentiment,'' Tatum said.
   He said he hoped the two-day conference, which concluded Tuesday
at the Carter Presidential Center, would be a catharsis.
   Among those warmly recalling old friendships Tuesday was Atlanta
Mayor Andrew Young.
   ``There was no more important relationship in the civil rights
movement than the relationship of Martin Luther King and Stanley
Levison,'' Young said. He called Levison, an Atlanta attorney and
activist, an important voice of reason who emphasized non-violence.
   The conference, ``The Black-Jewish Alliance: Reunion and
Renewal,'' was sponsored by the Carter center, the Martin Luther
King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, the Washington-based
Marjorie J. Kovler Institute for Black-Jewish Relations and the
Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.

   Frost and freezing temperatures reached as far south as Florida
on Tuesday, while snow fell over Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and
Nebraska.
   Tallahassee, Fla., reached a low of 27 degrees. The cold spot in
Alabama was Pinson, where the temperature hit 23 degrees and
remained below freezing for 12 hours.
   Three to seven inches of snow fell in the morning in Iowa. Two
inches fell at Adams, La Crosse and Waushara, Wis., and Fairmont,
Rochester and Worthing, Minn. Advisories for snow were posted in
Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin.
   Up to 10 inches of snow were reported near Jay Peak, Vt., and the
high country of Colorado received between 4 and 8 inches since
Monday.
   Snowfall during the 6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 3
inches at Mason City, Iowa, 2 inches at Madison, Wis., and 1 ne inch
at Omaha, Neb.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 18
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 79 degrees at McAllen, Texas. The

   The Air Force is
spending $90 million to rebuild a launch pad for its new Titan 4
rockets, which will take secret military payloads into space, an
official said.
   Space Launch Complex-4 East has been used for Titan 34D launches
since 1982 and was rebuilt after one exploded in April 1986.
   The Titan 4 will carry payloads previously intended for the space
shuttle. Vandenberg's shuttle pad was dismantled in the aftermath of
the Challenger disaster.
   The 1986 explosion of the Titan 34D destroyed what was reportedly
a spy satellite and put the launch pad and one close by out of
commission for more than a year.
   The Air Force spent $50 million to rebuild the two pads so it
could continue launching the Titan 34Ds, said Col. John E. Angell,
who is in charge of Air Force space launches from Vandenberg.
   The launch pads were further rebuilt to handle the Titan 4
launches, he said.
   The first Titan 4 launched at Vandenberg likely will carry a $1
billion KH-12 spy satellite, said John Pike, a space policy expert
with the Federation of American Scientists.
   The reconnaissance satellite is capable of taking sharp
photographs of the Earth's surface through clouds, he said.

   The roar of chain saws and the smell of pine
from shattered trees permeated the air Tuesday as residents began
putting their lives back together and cleaning up from an estimated
$100 million in tornado damage.
   ``All my damage is minor compared to some of these people,'' said
Jeff Johnston as he and his wife, Helen, began cleanup and repairs.
Their house had broken windows and a piece of log embedded in the
wall; a tool shed was destroyed.
   The Johnstons' next-door neighbors were worse off _ the side of
their house was torn off. ``They'll have to move,'' Johnston said.
``This whole neighborhood is going to change a lot.''
   Four people died, 157 were injured and about 850 were left
homeless as the tornadoes tossed cars, houses and trees like
playthings along a 200-mile stretch of eastern North Carolina early
Monday.
   It was the first time since the state began keeping records in
1916 that tornadoes caused deaths in November, according to the
National Climatic Data Center in Asheville.
   Damage was estimated at $100 million statewide, according to the
state public safety department. Raleigh alone suffered $75 million
in damage, the city manager's office said.
   Teams from the Small Business Administration and Federal
Emergency Management Agency fanned out Tuesday to calculate damage
in all nine affected counties and determine what areas would be
eligible for federal disaster aid.
   The dead were 12-year-old Edwin ``Pete'' Fulghum and 9-year-old
Janet Barnes, both of Raleigh; and a Nash County couple, Lee Roy and
Mary Alston, who died in each other's arms when the storm hit their
mobile home.
   The Red Cross and other relief agencies said they were swamped
with offers of help.
   ``It renews your faith in humanity,'' said Helen Sibley, nurse
coordinator for the local Red Cross chapter.
   More than 300 families opened their homes to those affected by
the storm, she said, leaving only 17 people in a Wake County shelter.
   ``That's why there are not more people in the shelter,'' she
said. ``People in the city don't think other people care much about
them, but when something like this happens, we come together.''
   Businesses, individuals and churches donated food and other
supplies. A table in the school cafeteria was piled with sandwiches,
fruit, snacks, candy and desserts.
   In Raleigh, police restricted access to damaged areas, said
spokeswoman Jade Jurek. Fourteen people have been charged with
looting since the tornadoes struck, according to a Wake County
magistrate. Six Raleigh residents, including four juveniles, were
charged Monday with looting from a K mart that was flattened by the
storm.
   The state public safety department said Tuesday that 520 homes
were destroyed and more than 1,200 were damaged. Forty-one
businesses were either destroyed or damaged.
   Gov. Jim Martin asked the federal officials to declare Wake
County a disaster area, and the surveys of other counties will help
determine whether any other areas might also be eligible for
disaster aid or reduced-cost Small Business Administration loans.
   Al Warlick, a spokesman for the North Carolina Department of
Crime Control and Public Safety, said damage in Wake County is
probably extensive enough to warrant assistance from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. A presidential disaster declaration is
required for FEMA aid to be released.
   ``We are going to send a delegation to Washington with these
letters (requesting disaster aid) to make sure that any question can
be answered face to face if necessary,'' he said.

   An Israeli attorney for convicted Nazi war
criminal John Demjanjuk died Tuesday after hurling himself from the
15th floor an office building, police said.
   Police ruled the death of Dov Eitan a suicide. A court official
said it could delay Demjanjuk's appeal of his conviction and death
sentence for Nazi war crimes, scheduled next week.
   Eitan, a 53-year-old former judge who joined Demjanjuk's defense
team in August, died after jumping from the 15th floor of the City
Towers office complex in downtown Jerusalem, police spokesman Rafi
Levy said.
   Eitan did not leave a note explaining his motives, but deputy
police spokesman Alex Lapidot said police were certain the death was
a suicide.
   ``There was no note at all, none. We are trying to determine what
was behind it,'' Lapidot said. ``But there was no criminal element.
It was suicide, 100 percent.''
   Israel radio said police found traces of polish from Eitan's
shoes on the sill of the window from which he jumped in the
15th-floor lobby of the Ayalon Hotel. Eitan entered the lobby
without being noticed by the receptionist, the only person there,
the radio said.
   Demjanjuk's son-in-law, Ed Nishnic, said the defense would
request a delay in the appeal, set to start Monday. Court spokesman
Yossi Hassin said the bench probably would grant at least a week's
delay.
   Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar invited the parties in the
case for a discussion in his chambers Wednesday morning. Shamgar is
to decide whether the appeal proceedings will start Monday or be
postponed until Demjanjuk appoints a new lawyer, Israel television
said.
   In a telephone interview from Cleveland, Nishnic said Eitan was
to have presented 60 percent of Demjanjuk's appeal and that other
lawyers would not be ready to argue the case Monday.
   ``We're very upset and concerned,'' Nishnic told The Associated
Press. ``We spoke to Eitan yesterday. He was extremely optimistic
and said he hopes to see us in Israel.''
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, 68, was convicted in April of
crimes against humanity and against the Jewish people. He was found
to have been ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a brutal guard who operated gas
chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland.
   Demjanjuk, who lived in the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills
before being extradited to Israel in February 1986, claims he is a
victim of mistaken identity.
   Court spokesman Yassin said he saw Eitan on Monday and he
appeared ``very cheerful.''
   ``He was checking all the court arrangements, where the accused
would sit, where he would sit. It's all very strange,'' Hassin said.
   Demjanjuk's daughter Irene Nishnic, 27, said the family had left
a message for Demjanjuk at his maximum-security prison about Eitan's
death.
   ``I'm sure this is going to be a shock to my dad. He really got
along well with Eitan and had a lot of confidence in what he was
going to do for him,'' Mrs. Nishnic said, adding that Eitan had met
with Demjanjuk a week ago.
   An attorney who previously represented Demjanjuk, John Gill of
Cleveland, said he hoped police would investigate the death ``to see
if there was any foul play.
   ``I'm not suggesting there is or would be or was. But I do think
that would have to be explored,'' Gill said by telephone from
Cleveland.
   A defense witness, Swedish-born Anita Pritchard, tried to commit
suicide by slitting her wrists and swallowing tranquilizers on Aug.
21, 1987, after her testimony was discredited during the trial.
   Eitan served for 17 years as a Jerusalem district court judge
before retiring in 1983. His joining the defense was widely viewed
in Israel as adding prestige to the team.
   He is survived by his wife, who lives in Jerusalem, and two
children.

   An animal rights activist accused of

   ``Definitely not guilty,'' Fran Stephanie Trutt, 33, said during

then denied a motion to lower her bond from $500,000 to $60,000, and
she remained in custody.
   Animals rights groups have disavowed any connection to Trutt, who
was arrested on Nov. 11 near the headquarters of U.S. Surgical Corp.
in Norwalk.
   Police said she placed a radio-controlled pipe bomb packed with
roofing nails in bushes near the vacant parking space of company
chairman Leon Hirsch. Three more bombs were discovered in her New
York City apartment after her arrest.
   Trutt has said she didn't intend to kill anyone, but wanted to
scare the company into ending its practice of using live dogs to
demonstrate its surgical staples.

   Joffrey Ballet founder Robert Joffrey, who died
earlier this year, was recalled for his enthusiasm, good taste and
love of the dance on Tuesday at a memorial service at the City
Center, where his company performs.
   Among the speakers was choreographer Agnes de Mille, who praised
Joffrey's attention to details in recreating lost ballet
masterpieces.
   ``Bob had a strange reverence, curiosity and fervor for the works
of other masters, like a museum curator. He introduced them to
America. This is a gift to our time, to our culture, and Bob did
it,'' Miss de Mille said.
   Kitty Carlisle Hart, chairman of the New York State Council on
the Arts, said that the Joffrey Ballet performed nearly 200 ballets
in 32 years, about half of them created for the company.
   Other speakers mentioned that the company was the first to
commission modern-dance choreographers to create for it. It was the
first to have residences in both New York and Los Angeles. A ballet
that Joffrey choreographed, ``Astarte,'' was the first ballet
pictured on the cover of Time magazine. The last ballet he
choreographed was the full-length ``The Nutcracker,'' which
premiered in 1987.
   Reconstructions for the company include ``Parade,'' by Leonide
Massine, ``The Afternoon of a Faun'' by Vaslav Nijinsky, ``The Green
Table'' by Kurt Jooss and ``Billy the Kid'' by Eugene Loring. He
added many of Sir Frederick Ashton's ballets to the Joffrey Ballet
repertory.
   ``He was more talented, more demanding and more fun than anybody
I've ever known,'' said Alexander Ewing, former general director of
the Joffrey Ballet. ``He wanted exactly his own way because he had
dedicated his life to making himself so well-informed. He had such
good taste, unerring sense of theater and energy. At the end you
wanted it as much as he did.''
   Other speakers were Sally Bliss, former artistic director of the
Joffrey II Dancers; Christian Holder, former Joffrey dancer; Frank
Hodsoll, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, who read a
message from President Reagan; Felisa Vanoff, former dancer and
founding director of the Joffrey's board in Los Angeles; Howard M.
Squadron, chairman of the City Center board; actress Stella Adler,
and Alexander Grant, guest artist with the British Royal Ballet.
   Allan Lewis, Joffrey Ballet music director, conducted the AGMA
Chorus in ``Alleluia.'' Company members Tina LeBlanc and Glenn
Edgerton danced the pas de deux from Joffrey's 1973
``Remembrances.'' Jodie Gates and Edgerton danced a pas de deux from
``Reflections'' by Gerald Arpino, the company's leading male dancer
in 1956, now artistic director of the company.
   Joffrey, who was born in Seattle, died March 25 at 57.

   George Mitchell of Maine was elected Senate
majority leader on Tuesday by Democrats seeking a forceful new
spokesman during yet another Republican reign at the White House,
and he quickly promised George Bush his initiatives will be met with
``interest and enthusiasm.''
   Mitchell, a 55-year-old former federal judge, easily defeated
Sens. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. He
succeeds Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who stepped aside after 12
years as the Senate's Democratic leader.
   Asked if he would cooperate with Bush, Mitchell said he plans to
meet soon with the president-elect and ``We hope to move forward on
a broad range of issues,'' including the federal deficit, health
care, day care and the environment.
   Mitchell also planned to meet Wednesday with Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas, re-elected by Republicans to a third term as their leader
earlier Tuesday.
   Mitchell received congratulatory calls from Bush and Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle, as well as President Reagan.
   ``The Democrats await with interest and enthusiasm the proposals
of the next administration,'' Mitchell said.
   Mitchell, who was just elected to his second term in the Senate,
has a liberal voting record but promised ``to work with all the
Democrats in developing a broad agenda.''
   Within minutes of his election, Mitchell emerged from the party
caucus in the historic old Senate chamber of the Capitol to meet
with reporters. Quickly turning aside suggestions he would be a
partisan fighter, he said, ``We hope to cooperate with the new
administration to deal with the serious problems and important
challenges facing our nation.''
   Mitchell fell only one vote short of winning the Democratic
leadership post on the first ballot, picking up 27 votes. Inouye and
Johnston tied for second at 14 votes each, and quickly agreed to
give Mitchell a unanimous victory.
   ``The best man won. George Mitchell will be a great majority
leader,'' Johnston said.
   Mitchell, a janitor's son who worked his way through college, was
looked to by many colleagues as a solid, articulate leader and
speaker who can serve as a spokesman for all Democrats.
   ``I think the Democrats have realized the need, in the presence
of a Republican administration, to have a person who not only makes
the Senate function but also be a party spokesman,'' said Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del.
   ``There was a unanimous feeling, even among those who supported
the other two candidates, that George Mitchell well fits that
bill,'' Biden said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that although Mitchell is
an Eastern liberal, ``his impressive margin of victory is a welcome
signal that the liberal and progressive ideals of the Democratic
Party have broad support among Senate Democrats from all parts of
the country.''
   Perhaps Mitchell's greatest claim to public fame was his
performance last year during the Iran-Contra hearings. In a quiet
but nationally televised confrontation with Lt. Col. Oliver North,
who had testified with great patriotic fervor, Mitchell looked at
the witness and spoke into the microphone:
   ``Please remember that others share that devotion and recognize
that it is possible for an American to disagree with you on aid to
the Contras and still love God and still love this country just as
much as you do.''
   The Democratic caucus also elected Sen. Alan Cranston of
California to another term as party whip, despite a challenge from
Wendell Ford of Kentucky.
   Byrd was elected president pro tempore of the Senate, and also
will serve as chairman of the Appropriations Committee when the
101st Congress convenes next January.
   David Pryor of Arkansas defeated Patrick Leahy of Vermont to
become secretary of the Democratic Conference, Alan Dixon of
Illinois defeated Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii to become chief deputy
whip and John Breaux of Louisiana was named chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   In the Republican caucus, Alan Simpson was re-elected GOP whip
without opposition. John Chafee of Rhode Island defeated Frank
Murkowski of Alaska as conference chairman, Bill Armstrong was
elected chairman of the policy committee, Thad Cochran of
Mississippi was elected conference secretary and Don Nickels of
Oklahoma defeated John McCain of Arizona to be chairman of the
National Republican Senatorial Committee.

<HEAD>General Assembly Legal Committee Demands U.S. Give Arafat Visa</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with new material and editing throughout, with legal

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly's legal committee
voted 121-2 Tuesday night to ask the State Department to grant PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat a U.S. visa. Only the United States and
Israel were opposed.
   It was an indication of how lopsided the vote is likely to be
Wednesday when the 159-member General Assembly takes up the
Arab-sponsored resolution deploring U.S. denial of a visa to Arafat
so he can address the assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York.
   In denying the visa on Saturday, the State Department said Arafat
had condoned acts of terrorism committed by the Palestine Liberation
Organization. On Tuesday it said its rejection was final.
   All U.N. member nations are represented on the legal committee,
but not all were present for the vote Tuesday night.
   U.N. officials meanwhile began calculating the cost of the
unprecedented step of moving the General Assembly to Geneva to hear
Arafat speak on the Palestinian problem and Middle East issues. One
source suggested it could run around $150,000.
   Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
have enough votes to reconvene the General Assembly in Geneva. They
said the session probably would be in the week of Dec. 12-16, with
Dec. 13-14 the likely dates. It would be the first time the General
Assembly has shifted its session in protest, although special
sessions have been held in Geneva.
   Most nations were expected to assign their Geneva ambassadors to
the session and nations would bear the cost of their own travel,
diplomats said.
   The General Assembly on Tuesday delayed its annual debate on the
Palestinian problem, originally scheduled for Thursday, Friday and
Dec. 6, to permit arrangements for Arafat to speak elsewhere.
   The U.S. rejection of a visa set off an international uproar and
demands that Arafat be allowed to speak.
   If U.S. authorities reject the resolution to reconsider, as is
expected, the next step will be a second resolution later this week
seeking to move the assembly to Geneva, the diplomats said.
   Backstage deliberations sponsored by the British failed to remove
harsh language from the first resolution. It says America is in
``violation'' of the host country agreement and ``deplores'' the
failure to grant Arafat a visa.
   Under the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, the United
States pledges not to impede the travel or work of U.N. diplomats or
guests. The PLO holds non-voting observer status at the United
Nations and is an honored invitee.
   It is considered the sole, legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people and is invited to speak in all such debates.
   In Washington, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said the
strong opposition to his decision to bar Arafat shows that people
are forgetting what a threat international terrorism is.
   ``To some extent the opposition suggests how important it was to
decide what was decided and to make it so clear what the basis
was,'' Shultz said. ``The basis (was) our concern about terrorism
and I am afraid that it's too easy for people to forget what an
important problem that is and what a threat it is to civilized
society.''
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday praised
the United States for denying Arafat a visa, saying the PLO did not
genuinely desire peace with Israel. He told a luncheon of Israeli
newspaper editors that Shultz made ``a brave decision'' based on a
longstanding commitment to fight terror.
   Many Arab and other nations argue that Arafat deserves to be
heard because of what they say is a more moderate stance taken
earlier this month by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile.
   At its conference in Algiers, the council issued a declaration of
independence that included implicit recognition of Israel. The
recognition was contained in an acceptance of U.N. resolutions
recognizing the rights of countries in the region to exist.

   President-elect George Bush told Senate
Republican leaders Tuesday he will seek speedy confirmation of his
Cabinet, perhaps with hearings beginning even before he takes office
on Jan. 20.
   Bush also told the GOP senators he hopes any ``honeymoon period''
with Congress can yield a federal budget compromise, according to
participants in a private get-acquainted meeting at the Capitol.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said the president-elect indicated he
wanted to meet with ``a bipartisan group to discuss his thoughts''
before submitting a budget outline of his own.
   However, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee and the 1988 Democratic vice presidential
candidate, said Bush ``should not be in the position of not sending
any budget up.''
   ``This will be his first test of leadership. He has to show what
he believes in _ national defense, Medicare, revenues? He has to
speak to the principal points of the budget. That's part of the
price of leadership,'' Bentsen said. ``They just won an election.
It's theirs to call.''
   Republican senators said the vice president indicated during
their meeting that he would take up the matter of early
confirmations with the Senate's newly chosen majority leader, George
Mitchell of Maine. Bush called Mitchell to congratulate him shortly
after Tuesday's secret-ballot election among Senate Democrats.
   Bush is to meet with Mitchell on Thursday, sandwiched between
meetings Wednesday and Friday with Jesse Jackson and Michael
Dukakis, two Democrats who spent much of the year criticizing
Republicans in general and Bush in particular.
   Dukakis and Bush will talk at the vice president's residence
Friday afternoon in their first meeting since Bush defeated the
Massachusetts governor for the presidency three weeks ago.
   Bush aide Steve Hart said the Jackson meeting was ``in keeping
with what George Bush has traditionally done, which is to be open
and talk to people who are interested and concerned.''
   In 1981, the Senate, then controlled by the Republicans, voted
confirmation of key appointments of President Reagan's within hours
of his inauguration. Democrats now have a majority in the Senate.
   ``It would be important to his administration if he could have
early action on confirmation, particularly with some of the key
people like (James) Baker,'' Bush's choice for secretary of state,
said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.
   Cochran said that, if Democrats went along, confirmation hearings
could be held on Bush's nominations before they are formally
submitted.
   ``The Congress does come into session on Jan. 3. We could do some
work between then and the inauguration,'' Cochran said.
   He said that Bush indicated he would like the Senate to
``expedite the hearings and consideration of those nominees to those
Cabinet positions so that when the president is inaugurated, they
started to work right away, with the Cabinet in place.''
   Three members of Reagan's Cabinet that Bush has indicated he will
retain _ Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Education Secretary Lauro
F. Cavazos and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ do not require
re-confirmation by the Senate.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   _ A source close to the Bush transition, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said a decision by Bush on defense secretary
could come by Wednesday. The source said Bush still favors former
Sen. John Tower of Texas, but that some Bush advisers are objecting,
partly because they do not have a high regard for close Tower
associates likely to get choice Pentagon jobs.
   _ Other sources said that Samuel K. Skinner, chairman of the
Regional Transportation Authority in the Chicago area, is emerging
as the leading candidate for transportation secretary. Skinner, a
former U.S. attorney and close associate of Illinois Gov. James
Thompson, was Bush's state campaign director during the presidential
campaign this year and in l980.
   In his meeting with Senate Republicans, Bush reiterated a promise
to work with both Democrats and Republicans in forging a budget
agreement, perhaps beginning before his inauguration.
   While the senators shied away from using the term ``budget
summit,'' they indicated that's pretty much what Bush has in mind.
   ``I think it's going to develop that way but I don't know the
timing,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Bush said that he was in a ``listening mode'' in his second trip
to Capitol Hill since his election. His first was two weeks ago,
when he met with House Speaker Jim Wright.
   On Tuesday, Bush said ``I'm getting the message'' rather than
carrying advice.
   ``We're ready to go to work, ready to work with the new
administration,'' Dole said after the breakfast session. ``We
pledged our cooperation; he's pledged his.''
   Bush brought his choices for chief of staff and budget director,
New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu and Richard Darman.
   On another subject, Bush was asked by reporters if he supported
moves to hold a special meeting of the U.N. General Assembly in
Geneva.
   ``There should be a U.N. meeting and there will be a U.N. meeting
on that subject,'' Bush said.
   He did not elaborate. The Reagan administration has said it is
neutral on the subject of whether such a meeting should be held in
Geneva to give Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, a forum to plead the Palestinian cause.
   The United States has refused to give Arafat a visa to address
the United Nations at its New York headquarters. Bush aides said he
was not consulted on the State Department decision to bar Arafat's
entry.

<DATELINE>POCOPSON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic bishop, two pastors and
four other activists were released Tuesday after spending a day in
prison for an illegal protest at an abortion clinic last July.
   Auxiliary Bishop Austin Vaughan of Newburgh, N.Y., was believed
to be the highest-ranking church official to go to prison in the
United States for an abortion protest, and drew a letter of praise
from Cardinal John O'Connor, said Joe Zwilling, spokesman for the
archdiocese of New York.
   Vaughan and the other activists left Chester County Prison about
10:15 a.m. Tuesday, said Warden Thomas G. Frame. They entered the
prison at noon Monday to serve a two-day sentence.
   Frame said the period counted for two days under the terms of the
sentence and the rules for computing time served in prison.
   The four men and three women were among 591 people arrested July
5 at the Women's Suburban Clinic in Paoli, a suburb of Philadelphia,
after they blocked entrances in defiance of two court orders. They
were the first of more than 400 people scheduled to go to prison.
   District Justice Robert Mull found all the defendants guilty of
defiant trespass for the July protest and fined them $10 plus $50.50
in court costs. Those who refused to pay on grounds of conscience
were sentenced to two days in prison.
   Vaughan and the other protesters were held in regular cells,
Frame said.
   A group of supporters held an hourlong prayer vigil outside the
prison Monday night, said Michael McMonagle, a spokesman for the
Pro-Life Coalition of Southeast Pennsylvania.
   ``His (Vaughan's) willingness to undergo imprisonment, even for
this short a time, provides a tremendous boost for our efforts,''
McMonagle said.
   Vaughan's stand also was praised by O'Connor, archbishop of New
York, in a letter Sunday to the bishop.
   ``What you do today you do for all of us who want with all our
hearts to do the same but are not free to do so at present,''
O'Connor said, telling Vaughan his example ``will give courage to
thousands of other mothers to choose life, however difficult the
choice.''
   Besides Vaughan, those released after serving the two-day
sentence were Joyce Starrs of Parkesburg; Barbara Willsher of
Reading; the Rev. Richard Doron, pastor of the non-denominational
Church of the New Covenant in Marlton, N.J.; Priscilla Gossens of
Beechwood, N.J.; the Rev. Peter Byrne of North Tarrytown, N.Y.; and
Allen Billington of Glassboro, N.J.

<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Tuesday that Charles Ng
should be extradited to the United States to stand trial for a
string of sex murders in California.
   Justice Marguerite Trussler of Alberta Court of Queen's Bench
decided that the former U.S. Marine, born in Hong Kong, should be
extradited on 19 of the 25 offenses he is charged with in
California. She said she would issue a warrant that would keep Ng in
prison in Canada until he is surrendered to U.S. authorities.
   Charges of murder, kidnapping and burglary have been filed
against Ng in California. He is accused in the murders of 12 people.
   Eleven of the deaths of men, women and children involved grisly
sex slayings at a rural cabin in Calaveras County, 120 miles east of
San Francisco. The 12th involved the death of a San Francisco disc
jockey.
   Ng could face the gas chamber if convicted.
   Defense lawyer Don MacLeod said he will appeal Judge Trussler's
ruling. MacLeod said earlier arguments could take the case all the
way to the Supreme Court of Canada, which could take up to five
years.
   Ng, whose name is pronounced Ing, faces possible execution in
California. His lawyers are seeking to invoke a provision in the
Canada-U.S. extradition treaty that says extradition may be refused
unless the requesting state guarantees the fugitive will not be
executed if convicted. Canada does not have the dealth penalty.
   Ng, who was educated in British private schools, is serving a
4{-year sentence at a maximum-security federal penitentiary in
Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, for shooting a security guard in the
hand in December 1985 during a botched shoplifting attempt at a
department store in Calgary.
   Judge Trussler told a hushed courtroom she was satisfied, on
evidence filed during a six-week extradition hearing, ``that the
offenses charged in the state of California are extraditable with
one exception.''
   The exception was a charge of accessory to murder.
   The judge dismissed five other charges of kidnapping and
conspiracy to kidnap because no evidence was shown of transportation
of the three people involved, as required under Canadian law.
   She ruled evidence from Ng's alleged partner in the crimes,
Leonard Lake, should be admissible.
   Ng came to Canada after Lake was picked up for shoplifting in San
Francisco and committed suicide. Lake later was linked to the deaths
or disappearances of 22 people. That investigation led to the
charges against Ng.
   ``I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt based on all the
evidence ... that there was a general conspiracy that related to
weapons, money and sexual gratification,'' she held.

   An 18-year-old man who was released from a
juvenile probation camp this summer has been arrested for
investigation of two rapes and an attempted kidnapping at the
University of Southern California, police said Tuesday.
   Deon Proby of Los Angeles was arrested Thanksgiving Day for
investigation of a kidnapping and robbery that occurred earlier in
the day in North Hollywood, said Sgt. Dan Pugel. Bail was set at
$250,000.
   Detectives subsequently began investigating Proby in connection
with three attacks on women at USC in the last two months, he said.
   A fourth assault occurred on Friday, after Proby was jailed, and
authorities said at the time that it appeared unrelated to the
earlier attacks because the assailant's description differed.
   Detective John Rice said Proby was being held for investigation
of rapes that occurred Oct. 29 and Nov. 5, and an attempted
kidnapping on Nov. 9.
   During the Nov. 9 attack the assailant was frightened off by a
passer-by, but did steal the victim's car, which was later
recovered, he said.
   In the North Hollywood incident the assailant approached two
women and forced them to drive off with him in their car at
gunpoint. They were later released. Rice said the women were not
sexually assaulted.
   The attacks have prompted women on the campus to walk in pairs
and use a campus escort service after dark.
   Proby was released from juvenile probation camp in Los Angeles on
Aug. 26, Pugel said. But he declined to release details of Proby's
juvenile offenses.
   USC has 30,000 graduate and undergraduate students who pay
$12,000 a year each to attend classes on a 150-acre, inner-city
campus.

   The Duchess of York won press plaudits Wednesday
for her clearly evident success in beating her weight problem.
   The 29-year-old wife of Prince Andrew showed off her new sleek
figure when she presented the 1988 awards for business sponsors at
London's National Theater on Tuesday.
   She was criticized for having a dumpy figure immediately after
the birth of her daughter Princess Beatrice on Aug. 8.
   But the tabloid Daily Express commented Wednesday: ``Gone were
the excess pounds that had unkind jibes circulating after Princess
Bea's birth in the summer. Instead she seemed almost pencil slim.
   ``Friends say she has been rigorously dieting coupled with
dancing and aerobics.''
   Another tabloid, the Daily Mirror, said: ``The duchess has lost
well over a stone (14 pounds) and is now slimmer than she was before
she had baby Beatrice.''

   A 12-year-old boy was charged with
second-degree rape Tuesday in an alleged attack against his former
babysitter, a 30-year-old mentally retarded woman who lived next
door.
   The woman was attacked Sept. 22 at an elementary school across
from her home, said Detective Michael Burris.
   The woman, who has cerebral palsy, lives with her 68-year-old
mother, who said she believed that the boy and possibly others in
the neighborhood beat her daughter with a stick, then raped her.
   ``Three days before this happened, he (the 12-year-old) asked her
for sex,'' the mother said. ``She knew enough to say `No.' He said,
`I'll get you.'''
   The boy was arrested Monday. Detectives were investigating the
mother's belief that other youngsters were involved, Burris said.
   Arraignment was scheduled for Wednesday in juvenile court, with a
detention review to determine whether the boy should remain in
custody.
   Burris said the young woman's fear and limited mental capacity,
plus a lack of physical evidence, hampered the investigation. She
did not tell her mother she had been raped until three weeks after
the alleged attack, the mother said.
   The detective said the woman was able to communicate some details
of the alleged attack, but he wasn't sure whether she would be able
to testify at a trial.
   The boy could receive up to seven months in juvenile detention,
said Dan Donohoe of the King County prosecutor's office.
   The mother said the attack occurred after her daughter went to a
convenience store.
   ``She used to baby-sit the boy when he was little. (He) knew she
was mentally retarded,'' the mother said.
   She said her daughter had ``two great big goose eggs on her head,
and they took a stick and cracked her across the nose. She had black
eyes for two weeks. They beat her legs until her legs were all
pulpy.''

   Authorities probing the suicide of Prince
Ludwig Rudolf of Hanover, the 33-year-old great-grandson of
Germany's last emperor, and the drug overdose of his wife found
puncture wounds on their arms and syringes in their luxurious villa,
sources said Tuesday.
   Ludwig Rudolf apparently drove to a secluded woods and shot
himself in the head Sunday shortly after his wife, Princess
Isabelle, 26, overdosed on cocaine.
   Isabelle was found dead by her husband in their bedroom at the
posh Koenigin-Villa, a family property at Gmunden, a lakeside resort
in Upper Austria's Salzkammergut lake district.
   Police sources in Gmunden and in Linz, the capital of Upper
Austria province, said Tuesday that a preliminary autopsy showed the
Austrian-born woman died of heart and lung edema after consuming
cocaine.
   Ludwig Rudolf's great-grandfather was Kaiser Wilhelm II.
   A spokesman for Upper Austria security police, who spoke on the
condition of not being identified, told The Associated Press
syringes apparently used to inject drugs and a small amount of an
unspecified ``powder'' were found near the body of the princess.
   The Austria Press Agency, quoting a source in the public
prosecutor's office, said the powder was cocaine.
   The public prosecutor's office at Wels, Upper Austria, said
investigators found punctures on the arms of the dead prince and
princess, suggesting narcotics use.
   The result of an official post mortem was expected later this
week. Police said the case also is under court investigation, but
declined further details.
   Ludwig Rudolf, a distant relative of the British, Greek and
Spanish royal families, was found dead near a small lake at Almtal,
a wooded area about 20 miles from Gmunden, police said. His hunting
rifle was beside him, police said.
   The couple, married last year, left an 8-month-old son, Prince
Otto, Austrian newspapers said.
   Ludwig Rudolf, a descendant of the ancient Guelph dynasty that
includes some of Europe's top aristocracy, and his wife dined Sunday
night with members of a little-known West German pop group, police
said.
   The princess retired early and was found dead by her husband at
2:45 a.m. He called the Red Cross and told them that she had
``probably taken cocaine,'' a police spokesman said Tuesday.
   Ludwig Rudolf, a distant relative of Queen Elizabeth II, also
called his brother Ernst August in London, reportedly telling him of
his suicide plan and asking him to take care of his son.
   He then hung up abruptly, Austrian newspapers said.
   After making the telephone calls, the prince took his hunting
rifle and drove away from the villa, police said. His body was found
about four hours later.
   The couple belonged to the European jet set, moving in the world
of rock music and fashion. The prince spent many years in London,
and the princess attended a fashionable school in Kent, southeast
England, before training as a secretary in England.
   The prince was the middle son of three sons of Prince Ernst
August of Hanover and the grandson of Emperor Wilhelm II's daughter
Viktoria Luise of Brunswick-Luneburg.

   A newspaper columnist won the 1988 National Book
Award for fiction Tuesday with a novel about a murder in Georgia,
and another journalist captured the non-fiction prize with a book
about Vietnam.
   Peter Dexter, 45, a columnist for the Sacramento Bee and a
frequent contributor to national magazines, won for ``Paris Trout,''
about the murder of a 14-year-old black girl by a white man in a
small Georgia town just after World War II.
   Neil Sheehan, 52, who was United Press International's Vietnam
bureau chief in 1962 and worked for The New York Times from 1964 to
1972, won for ``A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in
Vietnam.''
   Sheehan's book examines the war through the eyes of one who lived
most of his adult life in the midst of it.
   ``I feel like a man who was on a long voyage of discovery ...
who's finally come home,'' Sheehan said after the winners were
announced.
   Sheehan, who took 16 years to write the book, obtained the
Pentagon Papers in 1971 while working for the Times.
   His book combines biography and history to tell the story of Lt.
Col. John Paul Vann, a troubled but dedicated career officer who
spoke out against the brutality and ineffectivesness of the early
U.S. strategy in Vietnam.
   Dexter said his novel's success would not cause him to give up
his column.
   ``I'm not someone to hole up in the woods and produce a novel
every two years. I like being on the street and hearing different
voices,'' he said.
   The writers' comments came at the awards ceremony, attended by
about 500 people at a Manhattan hotel.
   In all, 10 authors were nominated for the 1988 National Book
Awards.
   Don DeLillo, who won in 1985 for ``White Noise,'' was nominated
for ``Libra,'' a novel based on the life of Lee Harvey Oswald and
the events that led to the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy.
   J.F. Powers, who won in 1963 for his novel ``Morte D'Urban,'' was
nominated in the fiction category with his latest book, ``Wheat That
Springeth Green,'' about a middle-aged priest who is disappointed
when a new curate is assigned to his parish.
   Peter Gay, who won in 1967 for ``The Enlightenment: An
Interpretation,'' was again nominated in the non-fiction category
for his biography, ``Freud: A Life For Our Time.''
   Other nominees in the fiction category were:
   _Mary McGarry Morris, whose first novel, ``Vanished,'' is about a
couple who kidnap a toddler and embark on a five-year flight from
justice.
   _Anne Tyler, whose novel ``Breathing Lessons'' concerns a
long-married couple and the detours they take on the way to the
funeral of an old friend in Pennsylvania.
   The other nominees for non-fiction were:
   _``Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877,''
by Eric Foner.
   _``Nora,'' by Brenda Maddox, a biography of James Joyce's
lifelong companion and muse.
   _``Jefferson and Monticello,'' Jack McLaughlin's chronicle of the
life of Thomas Jefferson as seen through the prism of his love for
his rural homestead.
   The National Book Awards were established in 1950.

   President Reagan, expressing regret that the
Republican Party was unable to regain control of the Senate, asked
its GOP members on Tuesday to give George Bush ``the same
friendship, support and solidarity that you gave me.''
   Reagan's remarks came at a farewell dinner attended by Bush, Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle, GOP senators and their spouses.
   The president also lavished praise on Bush's onetime political
adversary, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, as a ``good friend'' and
a man who ``has never let me down.''
   President-elect Bush and the Kansas senator met for lunch on
Monday, pledging to put their past political rivalry behind them and
promising to work together on the budget deficit and other problems.
   Dole won the leadoff Iowa caucuses in the race for the GOP
presidential nomination, but Bush recaptured the momentum by winning
New Hampshire and went on to score a near sweep of the 17 state
Super Tuesday primaries.
   After the dinner in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress,
Reagan was presented with a gift from the senators _ a large ``weed
whacker'' for his ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif.
   ``It's a high-tech, top secret device that can be used to clear
out weeds, brush, trees, rattlesnakes, desperadoes and Democrats,''
quipped Dole, who presented the device to Reagan.
   In his remarks, Reagan portrayed Dole as a pillar of the party.
   ``I want to say a special thank you to a good friend, Bob Dole,
as a man I have come to know so well,'' Reagan said, adding, ``He is
a man so widely respected and admired that even senators on the
other side of the aisle routinely steal his jokes.''
   Reagan went on to portray the newly elected Republican team as
men who will work to continue his conservative legacy.
   ``As I prepare to return to California, nothing has meant so much
to me as the knowledge that Bob Dole and George Bush and Dan Quayle,
each one of you, and our whole Republican team, will be working
together for the values we share and the future that stands before
us,'' Reagan said.
   ``My friends, we need have no regrets, we deserve to be proud,''
Reagan said, but he also added: ``I must say, I wish we could have
regained control of this body.''
   The president went on to predict that the Republican Party will
``win control of the Congress, the same way we keep winning the
White House.
   ``Sooner or later, the other party is going to have to take the
hint and put themselves out of their misery,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan, looking back on his nearly completed eight-year term and
the 1980 election that swept the Senate into Republican hands, said
of his party, ``We have succeeded beyond anyone's expectations.''
   The president bid adieu to those turned out of office, and asked
those remaining in the new Senate, which will contain 55 Democrats
and 45 Republicans, ``I know that you will continue to do honor to
America and that you will give George Bush the same friendship,
support and solidarity that you gave me.''

   Two teen-agers were arrested Tuesday and
charged with murder in a sniper attack on three Rio Grande
white-water rafters that left one man dead, and authorities said the
boys apparently opened fire on a whim.
   Eduardo Pineda Rodriguez, 17, was arrested Tuesday morning at his
parents' home east of the Big Bend village of Redford, said Presidio
County Sheriff Rick Thompson. The 16-year-old, whose name was being
withheld, was arrested by Chihuahua state judicial police in
Ojinaga, Mexico, Thompson said.
   Authorities were still seeking two other people in the shootings.
   Both teen-agers were charged with murder in the Nov. 19 death of
Michael Heffley, 40, of Eastland. Pineda, a Mexican citizen who is a
resident alien of the United States, also was charged with assault
in the non-fatal shootings of Heffley's wife, Jamie, and river guide
Jim Burr.
   The group was rafting down the Rio Grande about 20 miles east of
Redford when shots were fired on them from a 300-foot-high canyon
rim on the Mexican side of the river.
   Burr suffered a gunshot to the right thigh and Ms. Heffley was
shot in the left shoulder and left side. Her husband was shot
fatally in the back as he shielded her and tried to drag her to
safety.
   The snipers stalked them from the canyon rim as they abandoned
their bullet-riddled raft and scrambled down the river bank.
   Mrs. Heffley, 32, told The Associated Press that her assailants
should be executed for the attack.
   ``I'm glad about the news but I think there are two more out
there,'' Mrs. Heffley said. ``From what I understand, I remember
that I had seen four.
   ``I'm glad that they are being caught and I think this incident
should be made a public example,'' she said. ``I think they should
be executed, because if they are not, relations will never get
better across the border. Nobody should have to go through this kind
of torture.''
   ``We have no motive for the shootings,'' Thompson said, adding
that both teen-agers gave statements implicating each other. ``They
saw them coming down the river and decided to shoot at them.''
   Thompson said police on both sides of the border, acting on a
tip, arrested the teen-agers about 8:30 a.m.
   ``It was just information that we had all received,'' Thompson
said, refusing to elaborate. ``We think the arrests of the other two
(suspects) will be in a reasonable length of time.''

   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno left for Washington on
Wednesday for talks with President Reagan, President-elect George
Bush and other U.S. officials to promote good relations between the
two countries, Japanese officials said.
   Uno's trip is the first outside Japan by a Cabinet minister since
Emperor Hirohito fell seriously ill on Sept. 19, a Foreign Ministry
official said. The emperor remains ill.
   Uno will meet with Secretary of State George Shultz on Wednesday
to discuss international issues including Japanese-U.S. relations,
said a Japanese official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On Thursday, Uno is to meet with Reagan and deliver a letter from
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita expressing gratitude for the
president's strong interest in Asia and the Pacific region,
especially Japan, during his eight-year presidency, according to
news reports.
   During his three-day stay, Uno also is scheduled to meet
separately with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and
Secretary of State-designate James Baker, the official said.
   Uno later will proceed to Montreal, where he will attend
international trade talks held under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international trade body.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Aeroflot plane to land at O'Hare
International Airport in 14 years touched down with more than 100
young Soviet professionals Tuesday night and was greeted by American
sponsors bearing yellow roses.
   The Soviet airliner landed about 6:30 p.m., nearly an hour late.
   Sergei Chelnokov, chairman of the Committee of Youth
Organizations of the Soviet Union, said his group was tired from the
15-hour flight from Moscow.
   ``But if you look in our eyes, you will see we are very excited
to arrive in this country on this very historic occasion,'' he said.
   The Soviet visitors, ages 28 to 40, planned to spend 2{ days in
the Chicago area as guests of Rotary International before traveling
to Philadelphia on Thursday for a seven-day U.S.-USSR Emerging
Leaders Summit and to Washington, D.C., for a four-day visit, Rotary
officials said. They were to return to the Soviet Union on Dec. 10.
   The roses, symbolizing friendship, were presented to the
visitors, few of whom spoke English.
   ``We want to provide a nice sort of prelude,'' Rotary spokeswoman
Martha Wilson said of the floral greeting. ``This (visit) kind of
complements real well what we're trying to do.''
   Members of the 80 Rotarian families that will open their homes to
the Soviets used nametags to match visitors with their hosts.
   ``I'm really excited about it,'' said Leon Liss of Lisle. ``We
might even show them a McDonald's and the Sears Tower.''
   Aeroflot charters to Chicago stopped in 1974 because of ``policy
differences'' between the Soviets and the United States, Rotary
officials said, and Aeroflot flights to New York and Washington,
D.C., stopped in 1982.
   Regular service between the two countries resumed in April 1986
as tensions between the two countries eased, said Nicolai Lisachev,
New York manager for Aeroflot. The Soviet airline now has two
regular flights a week from Moscow to New York, and one from Moscow
to Washington, D.C.
   Lisachev said no regular flights to Chicago are planned
immediately.
   The Soviet visitors, who include television anchorman Vladimir
Pozner, represent 16 professions, including the clergy and the
military, Ms. Wilson said.
   ``We want to give them an idea of what the Midwest is like,'' she
said from Rotary headquarters in suburban Evanston. ``We (also) want
to show off Chicago a little bit.''
   The Philadelphia meeting officially is sponsored by the American
Center for International Leadership and a Soviet organization called
the Committee of Youth Organizations. The groups asked Rotary to be
host of the Chicago visit, Ms. Wilson said.
   Wednesday's schedule included dinner _ with turkey and all the
trimmings _ at a downtown hotel, as well as a visit to the Art
Institute of Chicago. Mayor Eugene Sawyer was to speak to the group
at a luncheon.
   Jim Duffy, principal of Glenbrook North High School in suburban
Northbrook, and his wife, Mary, were two of the 80 Rotary families
preparing to play host to the Soviets.
   ``We're having roast beef for dinner,'' Mrs. Duffy said. ``But
also, I'm making a chocolate cake _ certainly typical of this
American family.''

<TEXT>
   An absent-minded robber who left his
gun inside a bank during a hold-up and locked himself out of the
building was tracked by a newspaper photographer, who ordered him to
``stop or I'll shoot.''
   Photographer Bobby Warner of the Montgomery Times was near the
Montgomery-Traders branch bank and heard the robbery report on his
police scanner, Officer Joni Ward of the Mount Sterling Police
Department said Tuesday.
   Warner followed the robbery suspect, Robert Robinson of Carlisle,
and pointed out the man's location when she and a deputy sheriff
arrived after the Monday morning robbery in this eastern Kentucky
town, Ward said.
   The photographer said he followed the man to prevent his escape
but also had wanted to find a way to coax him to turn around for a
picture.
   ``I stood behind a telephone pole and I said, `Stop or I'll
shoot,''' Warner said. ``And I did shoot him, I shot his picture.''
   Warner said the man did not stop but continued running up a hill.
When Ms. Ward arrived, Warner said he yelled and pointed in the
direction of Robinson, then took photographs as police made the
arrest.
   Robinson, 34, was charged with first-degree armed robbery. He was
held in lieu of a $25,000 full cash bond Tuesday in the Montgomery
County Regional Jail.
   The robber had forced his way into the bank shortly before it
opened by holding a woman employee at gunpoint near the back door,
Ms. Ward said. He forced another female employee to unlock the vault
and had both workers fill a duffel bag with money.
   Afterward, he made them lie on the floor while he tied their
ankles together with duct tape, Ms. Ward said. The robber also took
the car keys of one of the women.
   ``While he was tying them up, he laid his gun on a pop machine.
His mistake _ he left it laying there'' when he went outside to put
the money in the woman's car. ``He forgot that the (bank) door would
lock behind him, and he couldn't get back inside.''
   By then, a third employee was arriving at the bank, and the
suspect tried to get that employee to let him back inside, but he
refused.
   ``He told him that he had robbed the bank. ... He went to the
woman's car and got the money out of it, and he started walking
off,'' Ms. Ward said. The suspect was arrested soon afterward.
   Warner said a picture he shot of the arrest ran on the weekly
newspaper's front page this week and more photos appeared inside.

   Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands wounded
20 Palestinians Tuesday, hospital officials said, and merchants were
caught between one faction demanding a strike and another insisting
they stay open.
   Among the wounded were a 10-year-old boy shot in the leg and a
14-year-old hit in the chest, the Arab hospital officials said.
   More than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded in a year of
rebellion against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. At least 316 have been killed and 11 Israelis have been slain.
   Gangs of young Islamic extremists and PLO activists armed with
knives and clubs marched through Bethlehem in the West Bank on
Tuesday, shouting threats at each other and issuing conflicting
orders.
   Members of Hamas (Zeal) sprayed a warning to merchants on walls
in Islamic green: ``Today is a strike day. Be sure you observe it.''
   Followers of the Palestine Liberation Organization kicked on
closed doors, shouting to store owners that they would be protected
from Hamas if they opened.
   The strike was widely observed in the West Bank and Gaza. Hebron,
a predominantly fundamentalist West Bank town, was completely shut
down.
   Army commanders strengthened patrols and imposed curfews on more
than two dozen refugee camps, towns and villages. At least 370,000
of the 1.5 Palestinians in the territories were confined to their
homes.
   At the root of Tuesday's factional conflict was a disagreement
between Hamas and Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO over the
proclamation Nov. 15 of an independent Palestinian state.
   The declaration is based on a 1947 U.N. partition plan that
called for both Arab and a Jewish states in Palestine.
   Hamas rejected it and called a protest strike for Tuesday, the
41st anniversary of the partition plan. The Unified National
Leadership of the Uprising, backed by the PLO, did not call for a
strike.
   In a recent leaflet, Hamas leaders said: ``How is it possible to
think that Jews want a just peace? The Jew is a Jew, regardless of
the party he belongs to.''
   Three masked Hamas followers in Jericho, a West Bank town,
flagged down Arab-run buses en route to Jerusalem and forced them to
turn back, Arab witnesses reported. The young men entered the buses
and shouted at the drivers: ``Go back! Go back!''
   Stores were closed in Ramallah, north of Jerusalem.
   One shopkeeper told reporters other merchants complied after
being threatened by Hamas loyalists. An elderly man later advised
him: ``Don't tell these things to outsiders.''
   Another group urging a strike Tuesday was the pro-Syrian Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which also rejected the
independence declaration.
   Palestinian leaders expressed concern about the growing rift and
said it might harm the uprising in the territories Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   ``We know about the risk of this confrontation. We are working to
stop it,'' said Sufian Khatib, a Palestinian surgeon whose views
have been identified with those of the Popular Front.
   Khatib also said the coinciding strike calls did not indicate a
new alliance between fundamentalists and hardline PLO factions
opposed to even implicit recognition of Israel.
   ``We have some points in common but we are not together in the
field,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Another Palestinian official said the independence declaration by
the Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO legislature,
had wide support in the occupied lands.
   ``A majority of the Palestinian people are behind the PNC,'' said
Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, head of the Palestinian Academic Society for the
Study of International Affairs.
   Armed Jewish settlers in the northern West Bank launched highway
patrols on Tuesday to protect Israeli drivers from being stoned by
Palestinians. Three cars patrolled the roads, each bearing a large
Israeli flag, said organizer Yacov Eshel.
   He said soldiers stopped one car at an army checkpoint near the
Palestinian town of Qalqiliya and told the driver he could not enter
unless he removed the flag. The driver refused, and was turned back.

   A government official indicated Tuesday that
Iran is linking efforts to free foreign hostages in Lebanon with the
fate of Iranians believed held there.
   ``There aren't just American hostages in Lebanon, but there also
are Iranian hostages, who are in the hands of Christian
militiamen,'' Mohammed Javad Larijani, Iran's deputy foreign
minister, said.
   He made the comment after meeting with West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whose three-day visit to Tehran was
dominated by the hostage issue.
   Larijani was refering to three Iranians who disappeared with
their Lebanese driver in 1982 and were presumed kidnapped by
Christian Phalangist gunmen. The four are widely believed to have
died. No group claimed responsibility for their kidnapping.
   ``Western nations, especially the United States, have close ties
to (the Phalangists),'' Larijani told reporters. ``We want all
hostages to be free, the Iranians as well, and we will work as much
as we can so that they are freed.''
   He did not specify what actions Iran might take.
   In remarks quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency
and monitored in Cyprus, Larijani also did not rule out resuming
ties with the United States.
   ``If one day we were to resume ties with the U.S. such a
relationship would certainly be on the basis of mutual respect and
non-interference in each other's affairs,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Genscher has offered to act as mediator in gaining the release of
14 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, believed held in
Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, West German
government sources in Bonn said.
   Genscher's good contacts with Tehran throughout the Iran-Iraq war
were seen as key factors in the release of two West German hostages
held in Lebanon.
   Before ending his visit on Tuesday, Genscher told reporters he
urged Iran's leaders to ``to use all possibilities toward
contributing to the release of all hostages in Lebanon.''
   During his stay, Genscher held talks with Larijani, President Ali
Khamenei, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and other Iranian
officials.
   Genscher said he raised the hostage issue in each of his
discussions.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Tuesday that Genscher ``is not an emissary'' of the United States
and is not representing the U.S. government in the discussions in
Iran. ``He is not speaking in our behalf,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Obviously we're interested to hear whatever comes up in these
talks,'' Fitzwater said, adding that ``I'm not aware of any new
hope'' for release of the American hostages.
   Longest held of the 14 hostages is Terry Anderson, 41, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   In addition, Peter Winkler, 32, a Swiss employee of the Red
Cross, was abducted by three unidentified gunmen Nov. 17 in Sidon,
25 miles south of Beirut. No group claimed responsibility.
   Earlier Tuesday, Genscher and Velayati signed a cultural
agreement designed to lead to the reopening of the
government-sponsored Goethe Institute in Tehran. The institute
provides information on German culture and language instruction.
   Genscher was accompanied to Iran by a 30-member delegation that
included West German industry leaders. One purpose of the visit was
to discuss ways to help Iran rebuild its war-ravaged economy.
   West Germany is one of Iran's most important trade partners.
   Iran and Iraq, who began fighting in September 1980, agreed to a
United Nations-sponsored truce in August and have been negotiating
for a lasting peace.

   Unless the United States reverses its
decision to deny Yasser Arafat an entry visa, the U.N. debate on
Palestine will shift to Geneva so the PLO chairman can address the
General Assembly, diplomats said.
   Arab representatives planned to introduce a resolution today in
the United Nations that deplores the U.S. action, postpones debate
on Palestine now scheduled for Thursday until at least next month,
and urges the State Department to grant the visa.
   Saturday's decision by Secretary of State George P. Shultz to bar
Arafat from the country on grounds he was an ``accessory'' to acts
of terrorism against Americans has been widely criticized by dozens
of countries, including the Arab world and such staunch U.S. allies
as Britain, Canada and Australia.
   Only Israel backed the U.S. decision.

   The next Senate's Democratic majority gathered
today to choose a leader from among three politically different men
seeking to guide the chamber through its coming skirmishes with a
Republican White House.
   Sens. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and
George Mitchell of Maine were lobbying hard to succeed Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., who is retiring as majority leader. Many of their
colleagues said they had met or spoken to all three at least once on
Monday.
   All three camps were voicing optimism, though lawmakers said the
outcome still was uncertain on the eve of the vote. Each of the
contestants was continually polling the 55-member Democratic
majority, but the answers received might be more positive than the
results in today's secret ballot.
   ``It's a very painful thing to work as closely as you do ... and
say to somebody that you have a lot of respect for them but I've
decided to vote the other way,'' said Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C.,
who has publicly endorsed Mitchell.

   Consumers may cut back on big-tag Christmas
presents now that the nation's biggest banks boosted their prime
lending rates to 10.5 percent, the highest level in 3{ years, some
analysts said.
   The increases in the key lending rate by a half percentage point
were announced Monday and were the fourth this year.
   Many economists have been predicting a prime rate hike in recent
weeks because interest rates in the bond markets have been rising
due to inflation speculation and the dollar's weakness in foreign
exchange.
   ``It comes as no surprise. In fact, they (banks) seem to have
held back longer than I expected,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief
economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

   At least 17 tornado touch downs were reported early Monday,
covering 200 miles of eastern North Carolina, injuring 151 people
and causing more than $50 million in damage.
   One tornado sent one couple on a flying-mattress ride. Mark and

   In an age when half the marriages fall apart,
when commitments to that bond come hard and many delay it or shun it
entirely, a Virginia theologian offers a paean to marriage's beauty.
   The Rev. Edward Stone Gleason sees it as next to heaven itself.
   While he recognizes it doesn't eliminate the sorrows and
difficulties of life, he finds in marriage the balm that eases those
hurts and gives a glow of wonder to all existence.
   ``To be married means to be redeemed,'' he says. ``To be married
is to be loved only for who we are, not who we might wish to be or
who we might seem to be.''
   It is, he says, to be a ``new creation.''
   In a book, ``Redeeming Marriage,'' recently issued by Cowley
Publications of Cambridge, Mass., Gleason extols marriage in often
lyrical terms comparable to the biblical Song of Solomon.
   ``Night had become the time to feel close, in touch, arms and
legs wrapped around the other, the only one,'' he writes. ``The one
who knows me and who I am and what I feel and even who I would be. ..
   ``Day means assuming a role, playing a part. ... At night, it was
all real. ... The time just at dawn had a different kind of magic.
... Without her there would be no dawn, for there would be no reason
to rise, to greet the day, even to have a day.''
   Gleason takes an unusual approach to his subject, interspersing
descriptions of marriage and episodes from it with lines of the
marriage ritual in the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer and Scripture
passages.
   A professor at the Episcopal Virginia Theological Seminary, he
recognizes the strains of life, describing various marriage
breakdowns, causes behind them and also the restorative help of
friends.
   But mostly, he tells of the bracing grandeur of marriage itself.
   ``We offer ourselves to our spouse and are known, fully, and
accepted and loved. ... It is not acceptance of what we might wish
to be, but of who we actually are. ... It is grace, in all its
fullness.
   ``Such acceptance results in a sense of worth, self-worth, which
is given by the one to the other. Somehow, this make it possible to
mean something, be something, even do something.
   ``Every moment, every word, every action suddenly come into being
in a new way. Strange and wonderful, quite mysterious, one is unable
to function fully without the other.
   ``The ancient and most holy miracle: to be loved. One plus one
equals a thousand.''
   Novelist-theologian Frederick Buechner says of Gleason's
analysis: ``In an age that tends to take marriage lightly and
cynically, his high view of it reminds us of what, at its richest,
it can become.''
   Gleason says the ancient biblical image in Genesis of a man and
woman becoming ``one flesh'' is the powerful and miraculous truth of
marriage.
   That gift is ``beyond any other experience available to us,'' he
says, ``as close as human beings may come to know the reality of
heaven this side of the grave.''
   He points out decisively, and quite happily, the disciplines
required of a genuine marriage, including patience, unswerving
fidelity and total, unconditional commitment to the other.
   ``Nothing is to be reserved or held back. ... The old cliche that
marriage will only work if each reserves a small corner of the self
as private, never to be shared, is erroneous and worse, dangerous.
   ``For that small and reserved part will grow and grow and grow
until it ... destroys the marriage.''
   Children aren't the main object of marriage, he says, noting that
marriage exists before they come and after they're grown and gone.
   ``The essential fruit of marriage is the joy of becoming one
flesh. That miracle has nothing to do with children... The gift of
marriage is the gift of one another.''
   Gleason deals plainly and gracefully with the sexuality of
marriage, saying that any marriage without sex is dying or dead, but
he emphasizes that other qualities must precede and underly it,
saying:
   ``The first is affection, the most basic love, a part of every
love, and no love is possible without it. Affection is built upon
familiarity, time spent together, time which binds two persons
toether in common experience...
   ``The second is friendship. A relationship moves from the
familiarity of affection to the desire to develop common bonds,
common understandings, common hopes and dreams...
   ``The third is eros, sexual passion. It is not lust, which is
blind. Eros seeks one particular person and one person only,
striving for fusion with that other... Eros will not occur unless
first one has experienced affection and then friendship.
   ``The fourth is agape, the love of God. ... It is a love which
sees and knows us just as we are and loves us still and all. ...
Marriage includes all four loves.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry Smith's arm shoots up in the air
midsentence and he snaps his fingers.
   ``You know what it was? I'll tell you what it was! The seed was
planted in high school, because I had an English teacher and we had
to write a term paper. ... I couldn't come up with anything and (the
teacher) John Gulassa said, `Here's some books. Why don't you read
these and see what you think?' And he gave me `On the Road,' by Jack
Kerouac.
   ``That was the beginning of the end for me. You know, the
beginning of the end which turned out to be the great beginning.''
   Smith, 37, was searching his memory for the genesis of the story
of how a kid from a small blue-collar town in the Midwest found
himself in New York City as co-host of a network morning news show.
   ``CBS This Morning'' celebrates its first anniversary this week.
Though it is still struggling in the ratings behind NBC's ``Today''
and ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Smith and co-host Kathleen
Sullivan have developed an easy-going rapport, and the network seems
content to let them develop a following.
   The pressure doesn't seem to get to Smith, the most likely
successor to Charles Kuralt as CBS' resident laid-back philosopher.
   Smith's feet-on-the-ground attitude comes from deep Midwestern
roots and a strict religious upbringing. His father worked two jobs,
as a policeman and a milkman. Smith was the youngest of eight
children, most of whom ``got married pretty young and went out into
the world and got real jobs and had real lives,'' Smith said. ``I
was the youngest and kind of the surprise. I got a little bit more
attention than the other ones did, had a rich fantasy life about
doing something other than going to work at the Youngstown Sheet and
Tool.''
   Most of those fantasies revolved around television.
   ``I used to watch Jack Paar and just used to be fascinated by
characters like Oscar Levant,'' Smith said. ``Certainly in my realm
of existence there wasn't anyone real like that, and wouldn't it be
interesting to meet people and know people like that?''
   Despite a budding interest in literature and philosophy, Smith
went to college on a football scholarship and planned to be a
high-school football coach. He attended Central College in Pella,
Iowa, an intellectually ``dangerous'' place for a young jock, he
said, ``because they said, `Here are books. How would you like to
read them?' And so I did, and my notions about being a football
coach were short-lived.''
   He graduated with a degree in communications and theater. After a
stint as a public TV talk-show host in Denver, he moved over to
KMGH-TV, the CBS affiliate. There he anchored the noon news with
another reporter, Andrea Joyce. Their courtship sounds right out of
``Broadcast News.''
   ``We were just buds,'' Smith said. ``We worked very hard and were
very career-oriented and all that sort of stuff, so professional
that neither of us would have ever considered going out. We used to
`convenience date.' You know, `I've got this thing to go to, would
you go with me? Just go with me.'''
   A ``convenience date'' to the opera led to romance and later
marriage.
   Smith was a Dallas-based correspondent for CBS when he was tapped
for ``CBS This Morning.'' Even though it means getting up at 4 a.m.,
Smith says the schedule at least is regular and has allowed for a
``second honeymoon.'' Joyce now reports for Madison Square Garden
network. They go to Central Park everyday with their wire-haired fox
terrier.
   ``I don't know if I can do it forever. I saw where Jane Pauley
celebrated 12 years and I don't know if I could do that,'' Smith
said.
   His favorite part of the job is most like being a correspondent _
going on the road to cover every kind of news story, from political
conventions to hurricanes.
   ``There's gonna be a time when I just do that again,'' Smith
said. ``Doesn't have to be next year or the year after. There's a
time down the line when I'm going to go back and maybe that's what
I'll do for a living. I'll be a correspondent based somewhere.''

<HEAD>A Plan For Stock Market Liquidity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What this market of corporate stocks needs is
liquidity, said the professor, and he went on to suggest that the
corporations themselves consider providing it.
   The professor's observation has its origins in the debacle of
Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
hundreds of points in a few hours, devouring about one-half trillion
dollars of value.
   Now that's illiquidity, said the professor. There were sellers
everywhere and almost no buyers, and many of the specialists, who
are supposed to buy when others are selling, were swamped by the
avalanche.
   It could have been worse, says Professor Robert A. Schwartz. In
fact, it would have been worse if companies hadn't used their own
cash to buy back their own stocks. He feels they helped turn a tide
that could have destroyed the market.
   Observing those actions, the professor developed a detailed plan
to eliminate excess volatility in securities markets by asking
listed companies to establish permanent stabilization funds.
   These funds would remain on the sidelines, invested in U.S.
Treasury notes, until they were needed. And that need would be
determined by a precipitous drop in stock prices.
   Schwartz, who teaches economics and finance at New York
University, would have the companies enter the market to buy a
preset number of shares when the price of their shares fell to a
certain level.
   He offers this example:
   XYZ Corp. has 100 million shares outstanding at an average share
price of $52.50. It decides to stabilize prices by buying 100,000
shares if the price drops $2.50 to $50 a share ... and sell 100,000
shares in a comparable rise.
   The transactions would be triggered only when the price rose or
fell by an increment of $2.50. If the efforts failed to stabilize
prices then the company would be prepared to buy another block at
$47.50 or sell at $57.50.
   The company would be prepared to buy shares at each $2.50
increment down to a total price drop of $30 a share. For XYZ Corp.,
this would require a stabilization fund of a little more than $42
million.
   Schwartz, author of the recently published ``Equity Markets:
Structure, Trading and Performance,'' justifies his thesis by
stating that the only way to stabilize a market is to commit capital
to market making.
   The result of his plan, he says, would be more stable markets,
increased investor confidence and perhaps a bonus for the
corporations.
   He explains that the stabilization funds themselves might
generate positive cash flows because participating companies would
realize gains from routine buying and selling at certain price
intervals.
   In effect, they would emulate the work of the successful
specialists, making their profits from the spread between bid and
asked prices.
   Should such a plan work, it might encourage individual investors
to return to the market, which they fled in droves after _ and some
smart ones before _ the October 1987 debacle. One of their main
fears has been volatility.
   Schwartz, whose proposal was published in the fall 1988 issue of
The Journal of Portfolio Management, believes the stock market
remains overly volatile because of insufficient liquidity.
   He suggests that the liquidity added by the corporations
themselves would serve to mitigate sharp moves in at least two ways,
first by the infusion of money, and then by assuring owners to hold
firm rather than dump.
   To avoid any corporate manipulation of stocks, he would allow the
buy and sell orders to be entered only upon market openings and
re-openings, and would have exchange officials supervise the
transactions.

<TEXT>
   That recurring old battle over ``who is a Jew?''
appeared this week to be headed toward some kind of temporary
compromise, or at least less than an intra-Jewish breakup despite
the verbal fireworks.
   In certain quarters, harsh words still were being traded over the
issue.
   But several signs have shown up both in this country and Israel
that some sort of stop-gap arrangement or avoidance of an outright
breach may be in the making.
   The question has heated up many times over the last two decades,
usually in connection with Israel's political splintering which
often has parties dickering with each other for sufficient clout to
govern.
   The issue boiled to a head this month as a result of Israel's
latest inconclusive elections in which neither major party, the
right-wing Likud nor Labor, won a clear majority.
   That left the Orthodox religious parties, who won a substanial
minority of parliamentary seats, holding the power to tilt the
balance either way and to inject their demand for defining
Jewishness.
   They contend that converts to Judaism are validly Jews only if
converted under Orthodox rules, thus excluding those converted in
Reform or Conservative Judaism, embracing most American Jews.
   As repeatedly sought through the years, the Orthodox parties want
Israel's ``law of return'' offering automatic citizenship to all
Jews amended to apply to converts only if recognized by Orthodoxy.
   That would cut out the Reform and Conservative converts,
obviously relatively small in numbers, but raising a highly charged
principle of equity for the three wings of Judaism.
   In any case, the outcry has come hot and furious from Reform,
Conservative and U. S. secular Jewish organizations, charging such a
change would rend the fabric of Jewish unity and erode U.S. ties to
Israel.
   At the same time, some ultra-Orthodox groups have called the
outburst an anti-Orthodox ``hate campaign,'' ``engaged in
mud-slinging at Orthodox Jews.''
   However, there were some tempering hints in the wind.
   Leaders of 2l national U.S. Jewish organizations, Reform,
Conservative and secular, were in Israel this week, making their
rounds to try to head off the moves toward a showdown.
   Delegation spokesmen said that in a surprising development, both
of Israel's Orthodox chief rabbis, who support the Orthodox
political parties, requested meetings with the U.S. group.
   Meanwhile, a main U.S. Orthodox body, the Rabbinical Council of
America, voiced an unusual conciliatory note.
   It joined in urging that the question of who is a Jew be resolved
not by a political body like Israel's Knesset (parliament) but by
discussion among Jewish groups.
   In Israel labyrinthine political maneuvering, Prime Minister
Shamir, to gain support of the Orthodox parties and give Likud a
majority, at one point reportedly promised them their long-sought
change in the law of return.
   But later, he was reported bidding for renewing a shaky coalition
with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' Labor party, which has seemed
reluctant about it, but later indicated flexibility.
   It also needed allies to forge any governing front.
   Beyond these religious and political shiftings, indicating some
chance at some resolution that won't split Jewish ranks, an American
leader said that whatever the outcome, it should not undermine
support for Israel.
   Rabbi Alexander Schindler, head of Reform Judaism which had
voiced keen outrage at the threat to rule out Jewish coverts other
than those of Orthodoxy, said:
   ``American Jews must not permit the political controversy over
who is a Jew to turn us away from Israel or to weaken our resolve to
defense its cause.''
   He implored Israel's leaders ``to put Jewish unity before
considerations of political expendency'' and avoid any action that
would shatter the ``solidarity that binds the Jewish people
everywhere'' to Israel, but he added:
   ``Today, we must fight against any change in the Law of Return
with every resource at our command and, at the same time, we must
stand with the people of Israel as if there were no political power
brokers who would read us out of the Jewish fold.''

   United Methodist military and other
chaplains may not carry or use weapons, even for self-defense, says
the denomination's division of chaplains.
   Clarifying a long-standing policy prohibiting chaplains from
carrying weapons, the United Methodist Chaplains' Divison notified
its 666 military and 707 non-military chaplains:
   ``Weapons will neither be worn, carried or used in the conduct of
one's ministerial responsibilities, either officially or
unofficially. The violation of this policy is cause for immediate
loss of endorsement.
   ``To carry or take up firearms in order to protect one's own life
or the lives of one's companions is incompatible with the role of
chaplains. As representatives of ... Christ, we are not free to
injure or take another's life in order to protect our own life or

<TEXT>
   When it gave birth to Western civilization,
the Mediterranean was the world. Ecologists today are calling it a
``Paradise Lost.''
   Ravaged by man over the centuries, the face of the Mediterranean
has been scarred _ lush forests felled, wildlife silenced,
mineral-rich soil long gone, aquamarine currents fouled by oil
slicks.
   But some of the region's leading thinkers are trying to
rediscover a ``Mediterranean identity'' through the only common bond
they can find: a determination to save what's left of the
Mediterranean's environment.
   It's a region ``whose contribution is acknowledged by the world,
but whose future lies in doubt,'' wrote Serge Antoine, international
relations adviser for France's Environment Ministry.
   Antoine, among 60 delegates who discussed the state of the
Mediterranean at a recent international conference in Cairo
sponsored by the Rome-based Aspen Institute Italia, called on the
region's 18 countries to unite their cultural and political wills to
shape a brighter future.
   The institute, a branch of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic
Studies of Aspen, Colo., brings together political, economic and
cultural leaders to discuss current issues.
   A clear message emerged from the conference: the only way to
solve environmental, social, economic and political ills of the area
is to find common ground uniting the diverse cultures tied by
geography to the Mediterranean Sea.
   ``There's only one issue that can join us now, and that's the
environment,'' Gianni De Michelis, Italy's deputy prime minister and
president of the Italian institute, said in an interview.
   ``Despite the vast differences between industrialized countries
that border the northern Mediterranean and less-developed countries
bordering the south, everybody agrees we have to do something about
the environment. It's the only rallying point we have, the one issue
public opinion can use to force politicians to act.''
   Delegates from Europe, North Africa and the United States said
the Mediterranean region has greater potential for environmental
progress than most because of its manageable size and historical
links its countries share.
   They agreed, however, that despite the work of numerous local and
international agencies, governments aren't doing enough.
   A major topic of the conference was the Mediterranean Action
Plan, a survey dating from the mid-1970s seeking to balance the
area's environmental and development needs through the first quarter
of the 21st century.
   The Mediterranean basin is among the most developed regions in
the world despite its varied cultures, but its population and
industry are shifting rapidly toward its fragile coastlines. Tourism
is increasing greatly throughout the region, and almost half the
millions of annual tourists remain along the coast.
   The basin has 29,000 miles of seacoast, only 40 percent of which
is flat, usable land.
   Additionally, population is growing unevenly, declining slightly
along the Mediterranean's richer northern tier and expanding rapidly
in the poorer south.
   Experts warned of threats from other sources: ships dumping toxic
or hazardous wastes, deforestation on both sides of the
Mediterranean and the lack of effort to find alternatives to
fossil-based fuels that pollute the atmosphere.
   One proposal to spur Mediterranean recovery, suggested by Atef M.
Ebeid, Egypt's minister of Cabinet affairs, calls for the setting up
of a ``green belt'' along the entire Mediterranean.
   But U.S. delegate Peter Thacher of Washington's World Resources
Institute, while praising the virtues of the concept, cautioned that
national politics can and often do override environmental
considerations.
   He said the only way to achieve necessary international
cooperation for a project of the scale of the ``green belt''
proposal would be under the flag of the United Nations.
   Whatever is done, delegates to the conference agreed that the
need to do something is acute.

   If Florence Henderson felt strange about
seeing ``The Brady Bunch'' all grown up in the CBS reunion movie, so
might viewers who are still hooked on reruns.
   ``The Brady Bunch'' are starting little bunches of their own, but
they all got back together to celebrate Christmas in ``A Very Brady
Christmas'' on Sunday.
   In addition to Henderson, back are Robert Reed as father Mike
Brady, Ann B. Davis as housekeeper Alice, and Maureen McCormick, Eve
Plumb, Barry Williams, Christopher Knight and Mike Lookinland as the
kids. Only Susan Olsen did not return for the two-hour movie, and
the role of Cindy is played by Jennifer Runyon.
   ``It felt strange to go back to the roles,'' said Henderson.
``Robert and I were very nervous trying to get back into those
characters. The kids are all grown. That's going to be quite a shock
to all those kids who watch the reruns.
   ``The house has been redecorated. I'm into real estate now.
Mike's still an architect. One son's a doctor, one's a race car
driver, one works in an office. One girl's married, one's married
with a career and the youngest is in college. Plus, there are three
grandchildren. Can you believe that?
   ``In the story Mike and I try to give each other surprise trips.
I choose Greece, he chooses Japan. Instead, we decide to bring all
the kids home.''
   ``The Brady Bunch'' was the kind of television project that the
networks squeezed until they got everything out of it.
   The original series ran on ABC from 1969 to '74. From 1972 to
'74, ``The Brady Kids'' was an animated Saturday morning show on
ABC. Next, it was a variety show, ``The Brady Bunch Hour,'' on ABC
in 1977. Then, in 1981 NBC telecast the movie ``The Brady Girls Get
Married,'' followed by a brief series called ``The Brady Brides.''
The Brady Kids also put out a musical album.
   ``It's amazing,'' said Henderson. ``Someone brought a `Brady
Bunch' lunch pail for me to sign. They'd been offered $800 for it. I
don't know why the Bradys keep coming back. I went to Australia and
they're popular there.
   ``I guess it's because they're a family that gets along and works
out its problems. I think people get some help from it. I know when
I was a child, seeing movie musicals saved my life. I was the
youngest of 10 and we were poor. I could go to the theater and
forget my childhood problems. It gives people something to strive
for.''
   Henderson, who has four children, has been married for the past
year to Dr. John Kappas, a hypno-therapist. They live aboard a
70-foot yacht, The Big Flo, which is moored at Marina Del Rey when
they're not cruising.
   She has her own show on the Nashville Network, ``Country
Kitchen,'' and recently published a cookbook, ``A Little Cooking, a
Little Talking and a Whole Lot of Fun.''
   After the end of the ``Brady'' shows, she set a record for guest
appearances on ``The Love Boat.'' She also was on an Afterschool
Special and was a suspect on ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   ``Working on a series forces you into a monastic way of life,''
she said. ``You work from early in the morning to late at night. I
enjoyed it, but after the `Bradys' I guess the right thing never
came along. I don't miss it.''
   Henderson said that although she's the host of a cooking show,
it's the guests who do the cooking.
   ``It's a comedy and country music show with cooking,'' she said.
``I'd started in country music so it was interesting to get back to
my roots. When I grew up in Indiana and Kentucky, that was the music
we had at home. I sang with a country band in high school. We have
as guests people like Willie Nelson and Pearl Bailey. When you're
cooking you can ask some pretty intimate questions.''

production and pump prices back toward the cartel's benchmark of $18
per barrel.
   But before the day was out, one oil minister indicated Monday
that his new quota was not official, causing futures prices to back
off after a sharp runup.
   The accord, which ended the winter meeting of the Organization of

that analysts estimate the cartel currently is pumping.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rise After OPEC Reaches Production Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC's agreement to limit its runaway crude oil
production have boosted crude futures sharply higher, but skepticism
that the agreement would hold up in the long term has severely
limited the gains.
   The accord, announced Monday by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, sets a cartel-wide daily output ceiling of 18.5
million barrels, well under the estimated 22.5 million the cartel is
pumping now.
   It also resolved a key issue in the talks by giving longstanding
rivals Iran and Iraq equal daily quotas of 2.64 million barrels.
   While oil traders cheered the pact, they remained skeptical about
whether all 13 member countries of the oil cartel would adhere to it.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, traded as high as
$15.80 a barrel before settling at $15.03 on Monday, up $1.06 from
Wednesday's close.
   The market was closed Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving
holiday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Monday,
the December contract for wholesale home heating oil soared 2.93
cents a gallon to 48.65 cents. The December contract for unleaded
gasoline settled at 46.37 cents, up 1.91 cents from Wednesday.
   Energy futures fell from their highs of the session after the oil
minister of the United Arab Emirates said the output level set in
the OPEC accord was not his official ceiling. The statement by Mana
Saeed Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates minister, hinted at early
trouble with the agreement.
   ``The ink is barely dry on the document and the UAE is indicating
they intend to comply with it but they don't consider it official.
That would tend to diminish the importance of the agreement,'' said
William Byers, senior energy analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co.

<HEAD>Banks Raise Prime Lending Rate; Now Highest Since Mid-1985</HEAD>

   Consumers with loans pegged to the prime interest
rate can expect to see higher borrowing costs soon, but analysts
aren't sure whether that will translate into tighter purse strings
during the holiday season.
   The nation's biggest banks boosted their base lending rates by a
half percentage point to 10.5 percent on Monday, the highest level
since mid-1985 and the fourth boost this year.
   Many economists have been predicting a prime rate hike in recent
weeks because interest rates in the bond markets have been rising
due to inflation speculation and the dollar's weakness in foreign
exchange.
   ``It comes as no surprise. In fact, they (banks) seem to have
held back longer than I expected,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief
economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money,
including interest it pays on savings accounts or certificates of
deposit, and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates.
   The rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for
calculating interest on corporate loans and for determining many
types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, such as home
equity loans.
   ``It's clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowing
costs in December or early next year,'' said William V. Sullivan, an
economist for the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   But some economists said it was unclear whether the rate hike
adversely would affect the economy, specifically consumer buying
habits during the important holiday season.
   James L. Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist for Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets Inc., said, ``I think the direct effect is pretty
small because generally consumers aren't affected by modest
increases in interest rates ...''
   But Yardeni said some consumers might cut back on spending and
``buy only things that they can afford.''
   ``There's an underlying sense of uneasiness because so many
people have been through rough times even when the economy was
strong. The prime rate hike coming into the Christmas season may
make people more cautious,'' he said.
   The financial markets had no major reaction to Monday's
announcement. Stock and bond prices rose modestly, while the dollar
firmed against other major currencies in foreign exchange.
   Sullivan said the markets also are prepared for further increases
in interest rates.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned of
higher short-term rates unless lawmakers work to trim the huge
federal budget deficit, a key factor in the recent weakening of the
dollar.
   ``There's a building perception in the marketplace that the Fed
is, in fact, tightening conditions ...,'' Sullivan said.
   Sullivan and other economists predicted the Fed might soon raise
its discount rate, or the interest it charges on loans to banks, and
if that happens, the banks might raise rates again.
   ``I'd look for something (from the Fed) in the next two weeks,''
said Yardeni.
   Chase Manhattan was the first institution to announce the prime
hike Monday and several other major banks joined the move.
   The prime stood at 8.5 percent at the beginning of this year and
the banks have raised it four times since then. Monday's increase
put the key lending rate at its highest level since May 20, 1985,
when the banks lowered it a half percentage point to 10 percent.

<HEAD>Cargill Again Tops Forbes List of Largest Private Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The impact of the recent wave of leveraged
buyouts is evident in Forbes magazine's list of the nation's 400
largest private companies, which was topped for the fourth straight
year by commodities giant Cargill.
   Forbes said in its Dec. 12 issue that 40 entries on the list were
public companies that went private in 1988 _ compared with 21 on the
list last year _ including such well known businesses as Trans World
Airlines and Montgomery Ward.
   Minneapolis-based Cargill's 1987 revenue totaled $38.2 billion,
Forbes reports in its Dec. 12 issue. That was up nearly $6 billion,
or 18 percent, from the previous year, and was more than double that
of the second largest company on the list, Koch Industries, the
Wichita, Kan.-based oil company that had sales of $16 billion.
   Continental Grain of New York and Safeway Stores of Oakland,
Calif., were tied for third with $13 billion in sales. United Parcel
Service of Greenwich, Conn., was fifth at $9.7 billion.
   Among those entering the list as a result of leveraged buyouts
were Dallas-based Southland, ranked No. 6 with $8.5 billion in sales
and the biggest newcomer to the rankings.
   Montgomery Ward, Bell & Howell, Duracell, Singer and Trans World
Airlines were among other well-known companies that crossed the line
into private ownership in 1988.
   Forbes based its list on revenues for fiscal 1987, some of which
were reported by the companies and some of which were estimated by
the magazine.
   Total revenue of the 400 companies rose 17 percent to $523
billion in 1988 from 1987, Forbes said. By comparison, combined
sales for the 400 largest public companies in the United States rose
7.4 percent in the past year to $2.6 trillion.
   A private company is one with no publicly traded common stock,
either because it has too few common shareholders to file with the
Securities & Exchange Commission or, if it files, its stock is
unavailable to the general public.
   The number of people employed at Forbes 400 private companies
totaled 3.7 million, up 14 percent from last year's 3.2 million.
United Parcel Service leads the list with 170,000 employees.
   Service-oriented companies and those that turn over their assets
rapidly had the largest representation on the list, including food
wholesalers and grocery chains, apparel importers, commodity traders
and real estate.
   Fifteen media and communications companies made the list,
including Hearst, Cox Enterprises and Readers Digest Association.
   Trump Organization, Taubman Co. and the Rockefeller Group were
among several real estate companies on the list.
   Goldman Sachs, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Oppenheimer were among
the securities brokerage houses on this year's top 400 ranking.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Takeover of Kraft Clears Key Hurdle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. says the federal
government has cleared its $12.6 billion purchase of Kraft Inc., a
deal that would make it the world's biggest consumer products
company.
   The tobacco and foods giant said Monday that the Federal Trade
Commission had declined to raise antitrust objections to the buyout.
   The lone remaining hurdle to the deal is obtaining sufficient
shares under terms of Philip Morris' $106-a-share tender offer,
which it reaffirmed would expire at 5 p.m. EST Friday.
   The company said about 49.8 percent of Kraft's estimated 119.3
million common shares and share equivalents had been tendered as of
last Friday, and analysts said they had little doubt the takeover
would be completed.
   Previously, Philip Morris valued the transaction at about $13.1
billion, but said Monday that it had has found there were fewer
common shares and equivalents outstanding than it had expected.
   Nonetheless, the acquisition still would be the biggest buyout to
date outside the oil business. Only the $13.4 billion takeover of
Gulf Oil by what now is Chevron Corp. in 1984 was larger, and that
could soon be surpassed as $20 billion-plus bids are being weighed
for RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Philip Morris said Monday the waiting period for the FTC's review
of the proposed takeover had expired on Friday.
   Asked the significance of that development, Philip Morris
spokesman George L. Knox said it meant the FTC had not challenged
the deal. ``We can proceed with our tender offer,'' he said.
   Critics had argued that the size of the deal would hurt consumers
by giving Philip Morris too much influence over prices, supply
systems and advertising time.
   In Washington, FTC Director Anna Davis would neither confirm nor
deny the Philip Morris statement. She said the commission had a
policy of not commenting on such matters unless it blocked a merger
or granted early termination of the required waiting period for
antitrust review.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Kraft rose 62{ cents a share
to $105.62{ and Philip Morris fell 37{ cents a share to $95.37{.
   The Philip Morris deal would bring well-known Kraft brands such
as Miracle Whip salad dressing, Velveeta cheese, Sealtest ice cream
and Tombstone frozen pizzas into the same corporate corral as
Marlboro cigarettes, Maxwell House coffee, Post cereals, Oscar Mayer
meats and Miller beer.
   David Goldman, who follows the food business for the securities
firm Fahnestock & Co., said the acquisition may result in improved
distribution of Kraft products in secondary outlets where Philip
Morris' General Foods subsidiary is already strong.
   He said Kraft and General Foods products also may turn up more
often in network television advertising as Philip Morris uses its
extra spending clout to drive harder bargains for ad time.
   Goldman said consumers also may see Philip Morris use coupons to
guide consumers to its new products.
   ``You might buy a pound of Cracker Barrel cheese and get a coupon
for Jello pudding, or buy Miller beer and get a free coupon for a
Kraft snack,'' Goldman said.
   Despite the expansion of its food business, Philip Morris still
will be chiefly a tobacco company.
   John Maxwell Jr., the food, tobacco and beverage analyst for
Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va., said non-tobacco businesses
will contribute about 35 percent of Philip Morris' operating
earnings, up from 25 percent without Kraft.
   The takeover agreement announced Oct. 31 would create the world's
largest consumer products company, vaulting Philip Morris past
Unilever NV, the British-Dutch concern that had been the largest
with 1987 sales of nearly $31 billion.
   Philip Morris had $27.7 billion in sales in 1987, while Kraft had
revenues of $9.9 billion, giving the combined company a theoretical
total of $37.6 billion.

<TEXT>
   Beset by resurgent inflation, high interest rates
and a record trade deficit, the British economic rebound that eight
months ago was considered a miracle has turned into a problem for
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
   In March, Lawson was hailed as an economic wizard who had cured
the British disease of high inflation, high unemployment and high
interest rates.
   But last week, government figures showed the current account
deficit had quadrupled to 2.43 billion pounds _ about $4.5 billion _
in October.
   The news prompted British banks to boost interest rates for the
ninth time since June, rattling the stock market and raising the
prospect of higher borrowing costs for consumers and industry.
   Now, the government's policies and Lawson's political future are
being questioned, not only by such traditional critics the
opposition Labor Party but also by some members of Lawson's own
Conservative Party.
   ``With Conservative MPs (Members of Parliament) grumbling about
soaring mortgage costs and Labor convinced that the government at
last is vulnerable over the handling of the economy, the gossip at
Westminster has reached a fevered pitch,'' the Financial Times wrote
recently.
   Lawson is defending his strategy of using higher interest rates
to choke off inflation, which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher says
is her top economic priority.
   But critics say the strategy does not yet appear to be working,
is a painful way to cure Britain's economic ills and could lead to a
recession.
   Critics say the economic ills stem from the consumer boom sparked
partly by tax cuts that Lawson announced in March.
   The sweeping tax cuts reduced the top income tax rate from 60
percent to 40 percent and the base rate from 27 percent to 25
percent.
   The higher interest rates are intended to fight inflation by
discouraging that consumption, which fuels inflation and attracts
imports, and to squeeze corporate profits by boosting the pound,
thus discouraging inflationary pay raises.
   But the higher rates, which some economists say must go even
higher before they will work, also mean a stronger pound, which
hurts exports. Higher rates also boost mortgage costs, which helps
increase inflation.
   Some economists say inflation, which was 3.3 percent in January,
will top 8 percent. Lawson believes it will peak at 7 percent next
year before falling back. The annual inflation rate now is about 6.4
percent.
   On Friday, addressing Birmingham businessmen, Lawson said the
interest rate hike was ``a clear indication that this government is
not prepared to take any risks with inflation.'' But he added:
``Interest rates do take time to have their full effect.''
   Lawson came under particularly sharp attack last Friday when the
government announced the huge current account deficit.
   The ensuing interest rate increase brought the benchmark interest
rate to 13 percent, its highest level in more than 3{ years. Stock
prices plunged more than 2 percent Friday, and dipped another 0.7
percent on Monday, as measured by the Financial Times 100-stock
index.
   It marked the latest November turmoil for Lawson, who with five
years as Treasury head has held the office longer than any other
since World War II.
   In his Nov. 1 autumn statement, an annual speech which is part of
Britain's budgetary process, Lawsons new economic forecasts were
sharply at odds with his previous predictions.
   Two weeks later, journalists quoted him as suggesting restricting
government benefits for the elderly. The Treasury denied the
reports, but when challenged to check its tape recording of the
remarks said its tape machine had malfunctioned.
   Conservative John Biffen, a former Cabinet minister, said on BBC
television that Lawson ``clearly has a problem of confidence'' and
suggested he was in ``a very exposed position.''
   The Financial Times discounted speculation that Lawson was about
to fall from grace, saying: ``The chancellor's misfortunes are in
part simply a reflection of the unsustainable heights to which he
was elevated earlier this year and of the notorious fickleness of
some MPs and political commentators.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed and trading in a narrow range
in Europe today. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said trading was light because of
expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.
Dealers said the market was also waiting for Friday's scheduled
release of U.S. unemployment statistics for November.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.15 yen to a closing 122.15 following reported Bank
of Japan intervention. Later, in London, it was quoted at 121.83 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7333 West German marks, up from 1.7332; 1.4480
Swiss francs, down from 1.4515; 5.9200 French francs, down from
5.9225; 1.9552 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9547; 1,284.40 Italian
lire, down from 1,285.50; 1.1955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1918.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8430, more expensive for
buyers than late Monday's $1.8385.
   Gold prices were lower in quiet trading. Bullion dealers said the
market was seeking new direction following the price and production
agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on
Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $422.50 a troy ounce,
down from $423.85 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $422.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $422.00, down from $423.25 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.29 to close at a bid $423.31.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.13 a troy ounce,
down from Monday's $6.16.

   The dollar rose slightly against the Japanese yen
today, and share prices sharply rebounded on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 122.15 yen, up from Monday's close of 122.00
yen. The currency opened higher following its advance overnight in
New York, then gradually slid back. Sources said the Bank of Japan
bought dollars to stabilize the currency when it was about to fall
below the 122-yen mark in the early afternoon. The central bank does
not comment on its activities.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's rise in New York to the increase
Monday in the U.S. prime interest rate from 10 percent to 10.5
percent, and the agreement by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to reduce production.
   OPEC members meeting in Vienna agreed to a daily production quota
of 18.5 million barrels and a target price of $18 a barrel.
   The announcement triggered a $1-a-barrel increase in oil prices.
But Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the agreement's effect on
exchange rates was mostly psychological and it would not immediately
affect the world economy.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of Daiwa Bank said the dollar fell after its
initial jump because speculators in Tokyo had expected an increase
in the U.S. prime rate and its occurrence did not change market
sentiment for a weaker dollar.
   ``Many market players still tend to think they should get rid of
the dollar now,'' Kinugasa added.
   An exchange dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking anonymously,
said other traders were awaiting the release of U.S. gross national
product figures for the July-September period, due later today, and
U.S. unemployment figures for November, expected on Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average regained 334.98
points, or 1.2 percent, to return to 29,318.30. On Monday, the index
dropped 380.27 points, its largest one-day decline since Sept. 1.
   The index gained 79.53 points shortly after trading began Tuesday
and advanced further in the afternoon, boosted by the stabilized
currency market, dealers said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.1 billion shares
in active trading.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are writing new rules
designed to make savings and loan failures less likely and let the
government step in before losses get out of hand when an institution
does go under.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees the nation's
3,028 federally insured S&Ls, on Monday proposed an ``early
intervention'' plan that would permit it to install new management
before an institution actually becomes insolvent.
   It is also considering regulations requiring institutions with
riskier real estate and commercial investments to hold more capital,
or reserve funds, than institutions investing mostly in residential
mortgages, the traditional mainstay of the thrift industry.
   The proposals ``seek to prevent problems before they arise and to
resolve those that arise before they cost ... significant sums,''
bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said in a statement.
   A draft of the new rules will be formally issued in about two
weeks by the board, which will allow 90 days for public comment
before taking final action.
   Capital is the difference between an institution's loans and
other assets and its deposits and other liabilities. An
institution's losses come out of its capital. Thus, S&Ls with more
capital are less likely to fail and require rescue by the government
deposit insurance fund.
   The industry's capital level has fallen dramatically during the
1980s. Early in the decade, high interest rates ate into profits.
Later, the collapse of oil prices and Southwestern real estate
pushed many S&Ls into the red. Critics say lax capital standards
made the problem worse.
   Bank board officials say capital at the typical, or median,
institution was 5.6 percent in 1980, fell to a low of 3.5 percent in
1984 and has since rebounded to 5.2 percent.
   The new risk-based rule would require capital of 8 percent by
January 1993. The current goal is 6 percent, with no fixed date set
for reaching that.
   The new policy also would permit regulators to take action when
an institution's capital falls to 1.5 percent of assets, rather than
wait until it disappears completely.
   Roughly 500 institutions are currently considered insolvent. At
the end of September, an additional 269 would have been subject to
bank board action under the 1.5 percent standard, said John
Fiechter, managing director for policy in the bank board's
regulatory office.
   The proposed new regulations would give institutions
concentrating on residential mortgages a break, requiring only half
as much capital for a home mortgage as for a commercial loan. It
would require a fifth as much capital for mortgage-backed securities.
   However, the standard for direct investments in real estate,
corporate stock and other ventures and for junk bonds is triple the
standard for commercial loans. Also, institutions that borrow money
by pledging their assets as collateral would have to raise more
capital.
   If the mix of the industry's investments were to remain
unchanged, the proposal would force a 25 percent increase in S&Ls'
capital, Fiechter said.
   ``It will certainly be an incentive for thrifts to stay in their
traditional business,'' said Joseph T. Lynyak III, an attorney with
McKenna, Conner & Cuneo, which specializes in financial services law.
   The proposal is similar to rules adopted in August by commercial
bank regulators. However, unlike the bank rules, the S&L rules also
require institutions more vulnerable to fluctuations in interest
rates to have more capital.
   Wendy Samuel, general counsel for the National Council of Savings
Institutions, a trade group, said the industry recognizes the need
for additional capital tied to risk. However, she said the bank
board must adopt measures to encourage capital formation.
   ``The targets are certainly ... laudable as an ideal,'' she said.
``But, it's going to be a while before it's practical. You're not
going to wave a magic wand and declare, `Now there's capital.'''
   Bert Ely, an industry analyst in Alexandria, Va., said the
prospect of increasing capital is poor because most S&Ls' earnings
are low and the market for their stock is depressed.
   ``Where do they (regulators) think the money is going to come
from? ... I think they're going to have a lot of problems
implementing this,'' he said.
   He added that the 269 institutions subject to action under the
1.5 percent threshold ``are going to scream bloody murder,''
increasing pressure on Congress and regulators to grant exceptions
from the rules.

   An American professor who drafted
proposed economic reforms for Chinese officials said he expected
little more than a handshake and photograph when he was summoned to
meet with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   But James C. Hsiao, 53, a professor of economics and finance at
Southern Connecticut State University, found himself engaged in a
frank discussion with the Communist Party leader. The meeting lasted
nearly 90 minutes and was reported on the front pages of Chinese
newspapers and on television.
   The meeting occurred while Hsiao, a native of China who has lived
in the United States since 1960, was visiting the Hunan province
late this summer under the auspices of the United Nations
Development Program.
   Hsiao was touring a railroad car factory when he received word
that he was wanted in Beijing, but he did not learn until after his
arrival in the capital that it was Zhao who wished to speak with him.
   ``I thought it would be just 10 minutes _ shake hands, take your
picture,'' he said Monday.
   Before leaving the United States, Hsiao, the founder and former
dean of Southern Connecticut's business school, had mailed a copy of
his economic proposals to Chinese leaders, not quite sure who would
read the 17-page document. In case officials did not want to read
the whole thing, he included a two-page summary.
   Hsiao said it was clear from his conversation with Zhao that the
Chinese leader had read the entire document.
   ``That impressed me the most,'' he said. ``He was very
interested.''
   Hsiao said he was told to speak his mind, and that the exchange
``sounded like a normal discussion between two economists.''
   ``Basically I proposed that some state-run enterprises ultimately
should be given to the people,'' said Hsiao.
   Production would increase if people were made responsible for a
company's profits and losses, he said. Under the current system, he
said, there is no incentive to go beyond quotas, and nobody is
accountable because ``no one is the boss.''
   Although private enterprise is permitted on a limited basis in
China, Hsiao said he told Zhao that the government should take
action to promote such activities. Entrepeneurs now proceed
cautiously, he said, because they fear state intevention.
   Hsiao also recommended that local government adopt rules and
regulations protecting the property rights and interests of private
owners.
   According to Hsiao, the Chinese leader agreed that provisions
should be adopted to promote private enterprise.
   Hsiao also quoted Zhao as saying that China is already moving in
the general direction he proposed, but that the government's actions
must take into account society's ability to bear radical reforms.
   ``Zhao believes that there is only so much that society can
absorb at a time,'' Hsiao said.
   The professor said he is cautiously optimistic that China will be
able to solve its economic problems. Unlike the situation in the
Soviet Union, he said, ``people in China are fully aware that their
future is tied to the success of economic reform.''

   Share prices were slightly firmer in London at
midday Tuesday with trading activity concentrated in a handful of
the leading blue chip stocks, dealers said.
   The market was still recovering its confidence after Friday's
announcement of a record 2.4 billion pound, or $4.5 billion, current
account deficit for October and the subsequent rise in base lending
raes to 13 percent, dealers said.
   There were few economic developments Tuesday to give the market a
firm direction, and trading was concentrated in a few stocks
affected by special situations or takeover speculation, they said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 4.5
points, or 0.25 percent, at 1,786.9 at 12:46 p.m., below the day's
high of 1,793.5, up 12.0, which came soon after the market's
official 9 a.m. opening.
   Volume was a modest 263.2 million shares, up from 185.4 million
shares at the same time Monday.
   ``The market is still picking up the pieces after Friday's trade
figures,'' one dealer said.
   ``The market is cheap enough not to sell shares, but it's not
cheap enough to generate much buying.''

<HEAD>Judge Removes Chairman And Two Trustees Of Dalkon Shield Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has removed the chairman and
two trustees supervising the $2.4 billion trust for victims of the
Dalkon Shield birth control device after a complaint that they had
shown bad judgment resulting in inaction and delays.
   U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., who is supervising the
bankruptcy proceeding of the A.H. Robins Co., on Monday ordered the
immediate removal of Barbara B. Blum of New York, the chairman of
the Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust; Gene Locks, a lawyer in
Philadelphia; and Ann Samani of Lexington, Ky., a former member of
the Dalkon Shield Claimants Committee.
   Merhige did not outline his reasons for removing the trustees in
his two-page order. But he noted that an opinion would be filed
today in Richmond, headquarters of A.H. Robins, manufacturer of the
Dalkon Shield.
   The complaint by claimaints in the case against Dalkon Shield
contended the trustees used poor judgement in voting to retain as
counsel the Washington firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft,
which represents the separate Dalkon Shield Claimants Committee.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. disqualified the firm
from representing the trust.
   The complaint also accused the trustees of taking steps seen as
being confrontational toward Merhige's supervision of their work.
   The ousted trustees were among five appointed under A.H. Robins'
bankruptcy plan to set up a method for compensating victims of the
Dalkon Shield intrauterine device.
   Robins filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code in 1985 after hundreds of women filed suit claiming
the birth control device had killed some women and injured scores of
others.
   Under the reorganization plan, Robins would be acquired by
American Home Products Corp. of New York and would put $2.3 billion
in cash into the trust. In September, lawyers representing more than
100 claimants asked for removal of the trustees, arguing that they
were inexperienced and had not moved quickly enough to set up a
claims center.
   The lawyers also charged thatMs. Samani's presence on the board
presented a conflict of interest.
   Ms. Samani said she was among the women injured by the Dalkon
Shield intrauterine device, manufactured in the early 1970s by A.H.
Robins. She withdrew her claim to serve as a trustee. Merhige's
order permits her to reinstate her claim.
   The remaining trustees, Washington lawyer Kenneth Feinberg and
University of Virginia law professor Stephen A. Saltzburg, will
nominate successors. The nominations are subject to approval by
Merhige.
   Michael Sheppard, director of the trust's claims resolution
facility, said the trust's bylaws will be amended to permit a quorum
of two trustees to conduct business.
   ``We expect no slowdown,'' Sheppard said.

   Indications that quota-cheating would
continue despite OPEC's new production-limiting agreement sparked a
selloff that sharply reduced the gains posted in crude oil prices
when the pact was reached.
   The uncertainty was sparked when the oil minister of the United
Arab Emirates, Mana Saeed Otaiba, said the daily production ceiling
set by the pact for his country ``does not represent its official
quota.''
   Otaiba's comments, reported by the official emirates news agency
WAM, were interpreted as a warning his country might pump more than
its quota of 988,000 barrels a day. Violations of previous quotas
have caused chaos on the oil market and a sharp decline in prices.
   But on arrival today in Baghdad, Otaiba was quoted as saying his
country was committed to the OPEC accord ratified Monday.
   ``We are committed to the text and spirit of the accord we
signed,'' Otaiba was quoted as saying by the official Iraqi News
Agency. ``The U.A.E. signed the accord, and it remains committed to
what it stipulated regarding the production ceiling, the production
quotas and pricing.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, traded as high as
$15.80 a barrel before settling at $15.03 on Monday, up $1.06 from
Wednesday's close.
   The market was closed Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving
holiday.
   Each $1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means an
increase of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, although
oil companies do not necessarily pass along the full increase.
   The new agreement by the 13 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, effective Jan. 1, aims to curb the
cartel's recent breakneck production, reduce the world oil glut and
drive up crude prices.
   The accord's success hinges on whether all member countries honor
the quotas set out for them.
   Analysts said they expected quota cheating by the United Arab
Emirates, which is believed to be ignoring its current OPEC quota.
   The country has a new quota of 988,000 barrels a day, a gain from
948,000 barrels.
   Analysts estimate the United Arab Emirates already has been
producing as much as 2 million barrels a day. They say it is
unlikely it will reduce its output to less than 1.2 million barrels
a day.
   Paul Mlotok, an analyst for the investment firm Salomon Brothers
Inc. in New York, said the new agreement was likely to hold, even
with cheating by the emirates.
   ``As long as that is all, they (OPEC) won't fare too badly,''
Mlotok said.
   The production agreement was fashioned in nearly two weeks of
meetings by OPEC ministers.
   Under the pact, the cartel would limit production in the first
six months of next year to 18.5 million barrels a day, up from its
current official ceiling of 16.6 million barrels but down sharply
from its actual production, estimated at 22.5 million barrels a day.
It also retains OPEC's benchmark price of $18 a barrel.
   The new deal also brings Iraq back into the quota system. That
nation refused to join the current accord, arranged in 1986, because
it wanted the same, larger production ceiling as its war rival Iran.
   The ministers stepped up efforts to set a new quota for Iraq
after Iran and Iraq agreed in August to a cease-fire in their 8-year
war. The two countries now badly need additional oil revenue to
rebuild their damaged economies.
   After lengthy behind-the-scenes negotiations, the ministers gave
both the same 2.64 million barrels a day quota. Iran had a cap of
2.4 million barrels under the old agreement and Iraq 1.5 million.
   Other OPEC members are Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon,
Indonesia, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar and Venezuela.

   VaporSimac steam irons are being recalled
because of danger of starting fires, the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission announced today.
   About 10,000 VaporSimac irons have been sold nationwide by major
department stores and sewing specialty centers, the agency said. The
irons, which cost about $100 each, were sold between 1985 and 1987.
   The recall was initiated following seven reports of fire,
including one that caused a burn injury, the commission reported.
   The irons come with a separate, transparent plastic water
reservoir and are designed to operate both vertically and
horizontally, the agency said.
   Owners should immediately stop using the irons, and return them
to Electra Craft, 250 Halsey St., Newark, N.J., 07102, for a refund
including postage costs.
   Persons needing more information can contact Electra Craft at
1-800-223-1898 or the Safety Commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strike-bound suburban commuters crowded into scarce
buses or drove their cars on jammed expressways today, while the
government ordered out army trucks to move stranded passengers.
   The strike called by the Communist-led General Confederation of
Labor halted all trains on two of the four regional express networks
and disrupted subway and bus routes.
   The first army vehicles were expected to arrive in the capital
late today with as many as 400 expected to be on hand for Wednesday
morning's rush hour, the Defense Ministry said.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre announced the military
intervention on national television Monday night and accused the
union of waging ``a sort of union guerrilla warfare of harassment.
This is not in the French union tradition.''
   Delebarre said strikers blocked buses in their terminals,
flattened tires and sabotaged engines. The transit agency's
management was being ordered to stop paying striking workers and to
start disciplinary proceedings against lawbreakers, he said.
   General Confederation of Labor Secretary-General Henri Krasucki
said on French radio today that the government was mistaken if it
planned to solve the labor dispute ``with police, troops or military
trucks.''
   At midday today, the Paris regional transit agency reported the
regional A and B lines halted, only 60 percent of buses operating
and service reduced by up to 25 percent on some subway lines.
   Premier Michel Rocard's Socialist government has been hit by
striking nurses, postal employees, government office workers and
other public service employees demanding wage increases that Rocard
says would be inflationary.
   ``The real motive of these strikes is political,'' the
conservative newspaper Le Figaro said in today's editorial. ``The
Communists are trying to exert unbearable pressure on the Socialists
with a view toward the municipal elections of next March.''
   The Communist share in recent French elections slipped to less
than 10 percent of the total vote. But the party appears to see a
chance to grab the role of the only authentic leftist force, as the
Socialists continue the economic policies of the conservatives who
controlled the government from 1986 until last May.
   Krasucki dismissed repeated suggestions that the strikes were
intended to increase Communist chances in next year's municipal
elections as ``completely stupid.''
   His union is demanding increased safety measures and
across-the-board pay increases of $170 a month. The transit
authority Sunday offered raises of $42.50 a month. A typical transit
worker earns a top-scale monthly wage of $1,400.
   The two regional express lines paralyzed since Monday usually
carry more than 600,000 of the roughly 10 million people who commute
to Paris by bus, train or car.

<TEXT>
   A former Westinghouse Electric Co. employee
will get his day in court on an age-discrimination lawsuit against
the company under a ruling by a federal appeals court.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that the case
should have gone to trial and ordered the case back to U.S. District
Court in Pittsburgh, which had granted Westinghouse a summary
judgment in the suit by James White.
   White was fired in 1986 at age 51 from his engineering position
as part of a Westinghouse plan to reduce its staff by up to 10
percent, according to court records. Of the nine employees in
White's department, two were older than White.
   White had worked for Westinghouse for 29 years and nine months.
He contends Westinghouse chose him for termination because if he had
remained on the job three more months, he would have been eligible
for more retirement benefits.
   Westinghouse maintained that he was chosen because of low
performance ratings and because his position was the most expendable.

<HEAD>Dec. 23 Date Set For Stopping Kenosha Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will end passenger car production
at its Kenosha, Wisc., plant on Dec. 23 putting about 5,300 people
out of work, a spokesman for the automaker says.
   Chrysler spokesman Lloyd Northard said Monday that the former
American Motors Corp. plant would retain a work force of about 1,200
people, including 200-250 salaried workers, in the engine operation
at Kenosha once the car assembly lines shut down.
   The Kenosha plant now has about 6,500 employees, including 600
salaried workers.
   ``After Dec. 23, Chrysler will stop building passenger cars in
Kenosha,'' Northard said.
   ``Obviously there will be people needed after Dec. 23 in the
L-body tear-down operation and workers will also be needed to
dismantle the M-body tooling.''
   The M-body production is being discontinued by Chrysler, while
the L-body production is being shifted to Chrysler's Jefferson
Avenue plant in Detroit.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca had announced earlier this year
that auto production at Kenosha would stop by the end of this year.
   Ed Steagall, president of United Auto Workers Local 72 at
Kenosha, said he thinks Chrysler is making a serious mistake by
shutting down the Kenosha car production.
   ``The quality levels and the sales levels are there'' for both
the L-body and the M-body lines, he said.
   He said the union was preparing for the assembly shutdown. Some
workers will retire, some will relocate and some will return to
school, he said.
   ``It's going to be devastating and it's terrible'' that the
shutdown comes just before Christmas, he said.
   Chrysler initially said it would stop some Kenosha production by
July and the rest by September, but Iacocca later announced car
production would continue through December because of strong sales.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS New 6th graf, The Commerce Department ..., to UPDATE

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy grew at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate
in the third quarter, tempered by the summer drought, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the performance of the gross
national product, the broadest measure of the economy, slowed in the
July-September period after expanding at an annual rate of 3.2
percent during the first six months of the year.
   It was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986, when
the economy grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent rate. The department said
that without the drought third-quarter growth would have been a
strong 3.2 percent.
   The report, however, represents an upward revision from a
preliminary estimate last month, which pegged growth at 2.2 percent.
The revisions were about in line with economists' expectations and
fit in with anticipation in the market that the Federal Reserve will
soon move to curb inflation by dampening growth with higher interest
rates.
   Major banks raised their prime lending rates on Monday.
   The Commerce Department also reported today that corporate
profits rose a slight 0.2 percent in the third quarter, to $163.1
billion, the worst performance since a loss in the last quarter of
1987.
   In another report Monday, the Commerce Department said the
imbalance between what the United States imports and exports
narrowed to $28.53 billion in the July-September quarter, a 5.4
percent decline. It was the third straight quarterly drop.
   Through the first nine months of the year, the deficit ran at an
annual rate of $125.2 billion, compared with last year's record
$160.3 billion deficit. Analysts predicted the deficit for all of
1988 should be at least 20 percent lower than 1987, marking the
first time since President Reagan took office in 1981 that the trade
deficit has improved.
   Reagan policymakers have relied heavily on the dollar's decline
in value over the last three years to increase exports by making
them more affordable abroad, and thus help ease the trade deficit.
   The Commerce Department report suggested the strategy has been at
least partly successful, easing some pressure for the dollar to
decline more.
   Another event that helped the dollar Monday was an Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries accord aimed at limiting production
and raising the price of oil, which often is priced in dollars.
Higher OPEC prices raise demand for dollars to pay for the oil.
   The OPEC pact reached in Vienna, Austria, was viewed skeptically
by many industry analysts, given the cartel's history of violating
its own agreements, but it still pushed oil prices up more than $1
to the $15-a-barrel level.
   Meanwhile, major U.S. banks boosted their prime lending rates a
half percentage point to 10.5 percent, the steepest level since
mid-1985 and the fourth rise this year.
   The prime rate rise had been widely expected, but some analysts
said it also contributed to a strengthened dollar, which rose in
value against the Japanese yen, British pound, West German mark and
other key currencies.
   The dollar's strength helped the bond market, where the 30-year
Treasury bond rose about $2.50 per $1,000 in face amount and its
yield fell to 9.14 percent from 9.17 percent Friday.
   But the impact was hardly felt on Wall Street, where the numbers
of gaining and losing issues were about even in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.76
to 2,081.44, and broader market indicators were mixed.

<TEXT>
   A multimillion-dollar lawsuit has been filed
against a Greek banker accused in his homeland of embezzling more
than $135 million and jailed in this country on a fugitive warrant.
   The civil racketeering lawsuit seeking at least $34 million was
filed Monday by the Bank of Crete against George Koskotas, the
bank's former chairman.
   If the bank can prove the racketeering allegation to a jury, it
could seek three times the amount of damages claimed.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum froze at least $30
million of Koskotas' assets in accounts at Merrill Lynch and Irving
Trust pending a hearing Dec. 6.
   Earlier this month, Koskotas fled Greece, where he had been
indicted on five counts of fraud and embezzlement alleging he
siphoned more than $135 million from the bank.
   The scandal has embarrassed the government of Premier Andreas
Papandreou and prompted the resignations of two government ministers.
   Koskotas, 34, had been ordered to remain in Greece while
officials investigated alleged irregularities at the bank.
   In Athens last week, Spyros Papadatos, temporary commissioner
appointed by the Greek government to investigate the case, said in a
report that Koskotas used bank money for $200 million in loans
without collateral and gifts to soccer clubs, athletes, business
associates, journalists and friends.
   Koskotas was arrested by FBI agents last Wednesday when he
arrived on a private jet at a small airport outside Boston.
   Koskotas' Washington lawyer has said his client came to the
United States from Brazil for safety reasons.
   The lawyer, Ron Liebman, declined to comment on the civil suit
when reached in Beaumont, Texas, saying he hadn't seen the court
papers.
   Also named in the suit were Koskotas' wife, Kathy, a naturalized
U.S. citizen, and his brother, Stavros Koskotas, a Greek citizen.
The three were accused of forming a racketeering enterprise that
looted the Bank of Crete of millions.
   Liebman said Mrs. Koskotas was not arrested with her husband
Wednesday although she was in the United States; he refused to
divulge her whereabouts.
   In Boston, Assistant U.S. Attorney Victor A. Wild said Koskotas
remained jailed without bail pending extradition proceedings.
   Court papers said Stavros Koskotas and his family had been
reported to be in Colombia.
   Koskotas was suspended Oct. 20 as chairman of Bank of Crete. He
had acquired a controlling interest in the privately owned bank in
1984 after working in its Athens branch for two years as an

conspiracy indictment but a judge later dismissed the case, now
under appeal by prosecutors.

<HEAD>Big Inventories, Production Increases Mean New Incentives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN L. ADLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The math is simple: when too many new cars are
built and too few are sold, incentives result. Auto analysts say the
latest round will arrive in time for Christmas.
   ``We're going to have to have some type of programs,'' analyst
Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York said Monday.
``The companies would much rather give away part of the gross profit
than cut production.''
   Auto giant General Motors Corp. may have a 100-day backlog of
cars by the end of December, an inventory nearly 50 percent larger
than considered comfortable.
   ``If you just look at the recent reactions of the car companies
to inventory bulges, it's obvious they will do something,''
Phillippi said. ``Incentives of varying proportions and programs
have been part of the landscape for four years now.''
   Each of the Big Three have incentives in effect. Chrysler Corp.'s
incentives programs have no set expiration; many of Ford Motor Co.'s
programs are set to expire Dec. 5, while some GM programs expire
Wednesday.
   Ford, in the best shape of the Big Three as far as inventories
go, plans to build more cars in the first quarter of 1989 than it
announced two weeks ago. Its latest production schedule for the
first three months of 1989 shows 501,000 cars to be built compared
with 475,000 announced a few weeks ago.
   ``In the case of Ford, it is losing some sales because of a lack
of certain models, especially the Probe and the Continental,'' said
David Healy of Drexel Burham Lambert in New York. ``That's an up
side, but there's not very much good about this.''
   GM has begun trimming some first quarter production schedules,
Healy said.
   Whether the incentives will take the form of cash, interest rate
discounts or other, more exotic lures is a closely guarded industry
secret.
   ``They've got a bookshelf full of these programs, guys whose only
job it is to dream up new programs,'' Healy said. ``What they'll
basically do is what has worked best in the past for specific
models.''
   The prime interest rate rose by half a percentage point Monday to
10.5 percent at major New York banks. The prime rate is what banks
charge their best customers to borrow money, and the new rate means
consumers will pay more to finance a new car.
   ``If a dealer offers a guy an $800 rebate on a new car and he
goes to the bank and finds out the interest rate is 13\ percent, the
buyer may walk away,'' Phillippi said. ``It might be smarter to say
`The car costs this much. We'll give it to you at 7.9 percent
interest.'''

<HEAD>Attorney: Pillsbury Searched In Vain For Different Buyer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Pillsbury Co. found no takers among 15
third parties it asked to buy the company on friendly terms after
Grand Metropolitan PLC launched its takeover bid, an attorney for
Pillsbury shareholders says.
   ``They have surveyed the world and they haven't come up with
anything better than what Grand Met is offering,'' attorney Karl
Cambronne said Monday.
   ``The game is over. They need to redeem their (poison) pill or
negotiate with Grand Met,'' he said.
   Cambronne said the failed attempt to find a friendly suitor is
confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in which
Pillsbury says it has abandoned the search.
   He commented after a Hennepin County District Court hearing at
which Judge Thomas Carey took under advisement renewed arguments
from the shareholders' group on its request to have the poison pill
invalidated, force Pillsbury to negotiate with Grand Met and block
the planned spinoff.
   Pillsbury asked Carey to force Grand Met to put its best offer on
the table so Pillsbury can accept or reject it, Cambronne said.
   Grand Met, meanwhile, on Monday extended for the fifth time its
$60 a share, all-cash tender offer for Pillsbury stock.
   The tender offer now will expire at midnight EST Friday unless
extended again. By Saturday, 85.3 percent of Pillsbury's outstanding
shares had been tendered and not withdrawn, Grand Met said.
   The liquor, gambling and specialty products conglomerate launched
its $5.23 billion hostile takeover bid Oct. 4. Pillsbury's board of
directors has rejected it as inadequate and has refused to meet with
Grand Met Chairman Allen Sheppard.
   Pillsbury's investment bankers valued the company at $62 to $78 a
share in mid-October, said Lowell Sachnoff, one of the shareholders'
attorneys.
   Standing in the way of a takeover are Pillsbury's poison pill
defense and a plan to spin off its Burger King subsidiary into a
separate company.
   Grand Met and dissident Pillsbury shareholders are suing the food
and restaurant company to invalidate the poison pill and prevent the
spinoff.
   Burger King Chairman Jerry Levin will be questioned Thursday for
five hours in Miami by attorneys for the shareholders and Grand Met
as part of the litigation, Carey said.
   ``Hopefully we'll find out more about the (Burger King) plan,''
said John Cochrane, an attorney for the shareholders.
   Grand Met has said a separate Burger King would create a huge tax
liability for Grand Met if the takeover is successful. In addition,
Burger King franchisees have announced opposition to the plan,
saying it would add too much debt to the already troubled fast-food
chain.
   The poison pill, or shareholders' rights plan, would make the
acquisition prohibitively expensive and the tender offer is
conditioned on its removal, Grand Met has said.

   Stock prices were marginally higher in early
trading today as the government's report on the gross national
product had little impact on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 3.91 to
2,085.35 as of 10 a.m. EST.
   Advancing issues were slightly ahead of decliners, with 461
stocks rising, 412 falling and 540 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board was light, with 16.68 million shares
changing hands after the first 30 minutes of trading.
   The Commerce Department said the economy, as measured by the GNP,
expanded at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter.
That was up from the government's preliminary estimate last month of
2.2 percent growth, but below the 2.9 percent to 3 percent expected
on Wall Street, said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The GNP news sent the dollar lower and bond prices higher, and
therefore had a neutral effect on stock trading, Wachtel said.
   He said many investors were waiting for Friday's unemployment
figures from the Labor Department, which might give some clue as to
whether the Federal Reserve Board is likely to tighten or relax
credit.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE today was Northeast
Utilities, which was unchanged at 20].
   RJR Nabisco was up } at 89} as today's 5 p.m. EST deadline for
bids for the tobacco and food company neared.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.76 to
2,081.44. Advancing and declining issues ran about even on the NYSE,
with 710 stocks up, 726 down and 521 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 123.48 million shares, up from 72.09

<HEAD>Engineering Firms Settle in WPPSS Trial; One Defendant Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two engineering firms that designed two
abandoned Washington Public Power Supply System nuclear power plants
have agreed to a $25 million cash settlement to get themselves out
of the WPPSS securities fraud trial.
   Junius Hoffman, a court-appointed settlement master in the case,
announced the settlement Monday as the trial resumed in U.S.
District Court here.
   United Engineers & Constructors Inc. and Ebasco Services Inc.
agreed to pay $14.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, to
former WPPSS bondbuyers who bought into WPPSS' proposal in the late
1970s to build two nuclear power plants in western Washington.
   New York-based Ebasco also will pay up to $3 million in cash if
the plaintiffs recover less than that in disputed claims against
Ebasco's insurance carriers. In addition, Ebasco agreed to surrender
part of at least $50 million in disputed insurance claims that the
company may recover.
   A class of 24,000 plaintiffs sued more than 100 original
defendants after WPPSS defaulted in 1983 on $2.25 billion in
municipal bonds sold to build the plants. The plaintiffs claim
WPPSS, 88 public utility districts, and others conspired to lie and
hide information that might have discouraged investors.
   Judge William Browning signed an order severing United Engineers
and Ebasco from the suit, leaving Blyth Eastman Paine Webber Inc.,
the securities firm that acted as financial adviser to WPPSS, as the
only remaining defendant in the case.
   Including the latest settlement, the original defendants have
agreed to pay about $675 million plus funds recovered from insurance
claims.
   Browning still must approve the settlements. He has not yet
scheduled hearings on approval testimony.
   Plaintiff attorney Mel Weiss called the settlement ``a fair
compromise of our claims.'' He said he was taking into account the
previous settlements and ``the desire to get money to our clients as
quickly as possible.''
   Weiss said he no longer was talking with Blyth Eastman attorneys
about settlement possibilities.
   After the jury was reseated for the first time in more than a
week, he instructed members to attach no significance to settlement
talk.
   As he had done when two earlier settlements were announced, he
did not tell the jury the provisions of the agreement between the
engineering firms and the plaintiff.
   Testimony resumed with WPPSS employee Harlan ``Hank'' Kosmata's
24th trial day on the witness stand.
   Plaintiff attorney Paul Bernstein asked Kosmata why several
issues were not included in bond-sale documents called official
statements, which were given to potential bond investors.
   Kosmata, the liaison with the utilities in the project, rejected
Bernstein's suggestions that concerns about how construction budgets
were compiled might have been of interest to potential investors.
   He said the important issue was that the budgets were approved,
not that ``preliminary'' concerns about them were expressed.
   Kosmata also reaffirmed earlier testimony that he heard no one
suggest presenting test litigation in court to see if the utilities
had authority to commit themselves to the project.
   That authority was lacking, the Washington state Supreme Court
ruled in 1983, and the agreements to pay off the bonds could not be
enforced. That ruling led to the bond default.
   Bernstein introduced a 1983 affidavit of Peter B. Wilson, an
attorney for Bonners Ferry (Idaho) Municipal Utility, saying the
issue of test litigation regarding the authority was discussed at a
May 1975 meeting before the utilities agreed to the project.
   Kosmata said he attended that meeting and heard no discussions
about a test case.
   ``I came away with a firm feeling there was no problem,'' he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Asbestos Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eagle-Picher Industries has lost its bid to
force the federal government to assume some of the liability for
suits over asbestos pipe material the company manufactured for U.S.
Navy ships.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear Eagle-Picher's
challenge to a decision by a federal appeals court in Philadelphia
that the government enjoyed sovereign immunity and thus was immune
to lawsuits for negligence from use of asbestos products.
   ``Obviously we're disappointed, but it will in no way affect our
other pending lawsuits against the government,'' said J. Rodman
Nall, an Eagle-Picher representative.
   Eagle-Picher, which has been inundated with damage claims from
people who say they suffer from cancer and asbestosis because of
their exposure to asbestos in the company's pipe compound, has
similar negligence suits pendiing against the U.S. government in
federal courts in Seattle and Washington, D.C.
   ``We think as conflicts develop between the courts, the Supreme
Court will hear one of these cases,'' Nall said.
   During the military buildup that followed World War II,
Eagle-Picher was enlisted by the government to make a pipe joint
compound containing asbestos for use in ship-building.
   Asbestos was found to be linked to a number of respiratory
ailments and Eagle Picher quit making the asbestos-laden compound in
the early 1970s. Claims filed against the company by shipyard
workers and their families seek damages totaling in the millions of
dollars.
   Eagle-Picher contends the federal government should bear some
responsibility for the asbestos-related claims because it mandated
the use of the product and routinely violated its own occupational
safety and health rules.
   ``The Navy insisted on the use of asbestos insulation aboard
ships. It alone knew the extent of the danger and told no one,'' the
company wrote in a position paper supporting its arguments.
   ``Companies, enlisted in the war effort, were told precisely the
formula for the insulation and how much asbestos fiber it had to
contain. ... The problem was created by the Navy itself for it set
the rules for handling the material and then broke them without
notice or warning,'' the company said.
   While challenging the government position in court, Eagle-Picher
is also trying to get Congress to pass laws making the government
liable.
   The company got legislation introduced in the last session of
Congress that would override the doctrine of sovereign immunity and
make the government accountable for actions and decisions just as
other employers who control working conditions that affect workers'
health are.
   The legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by
Willis Gradison, a Republican, and Thomas Luken, a Democrat, both of
Cincinnati. The measure had 70 co-sponsors.

<DATELINE>NATICK, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. announced today that its
board of directors has unanimously rejected a $20-per-share buyout
bid by MAI Basic Four Inc.
   A release by the computer company called the offer by Choice
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of MAI, ``inadequate and not in the
best interests of the company and its stockholders.''
   The board recommended that Prime stockholders reject the offer
and not tender their shares in response to the MAI offer.
   Prime Chairman David Dunn said the board considered several
factors, including Prime's business and financial condition, its
future prospects, recommendations from the company's financial
advisers and the recent value of its stock.
   Prime Computer stock opened on the New York Stock Exchange this
morning at $15{ per share.
   Board members also noted that Prime's next annual meeting
scheduled for May 12, 1989 comes before the expiration of MAI's
offer. According to the Prime directors, the current market price of
Prime common stock reflects the negative effects of the costs and
expenses associated with the acquisition of Computervision.
   On the other hand, the company expects belt-tightening measures
in certain areas to improve near-term and long-term operating
results of the company and increase values for stockholders.
   ``We believe the unsolicited $20 offer by Choice fails to
recognize either the intrinsic value of the company today or the
long-term values achievable by the company for all its
stockholders.''
   Financier Bennett LeBow heads MAI, which is a much smaller
computer business than Prime. Prime is second to International
Business Machines Corp. in the field of computer-aided design and
manufacturing systems. Prime acquired Computervision in February for
$435 million.
   There has been some speculation that LeBow undertook the takeover
attempt to induce Prime to buy his company instead, in what is
commonly called a Pac Man defense of acquiring the suitor.
   MAI Basic, a small concern based in Tustin, Calif., owns 4.1
percent of Prime's 48.5 million shares outstanding and is offering
$20 a share for the rest in a tender offer to the shareholders. The
offer, valued at $970 million, was made Nov. 15.

   Fujitsu Ltd. will pay International Business
Machines Corp. hundreds of millions of dollars for the use of
information about the software that runs IBM mainframe computers,
arbitrators announced today.
   The arbitrators' decision ends years of dispute between IBM, the
world's largest computer company, and Fujitsu, Japan's biggest
computer maker, over precious information about the internal
workings of IBM's mainframe computers.
   Fujitsu will pay IBM a total $237 million and tens of millions of
dollars each year beginning in 1989 under a complex payout plan
devised by the arbitration team.
   Today's announcement is the biggest development in the
IBM-Fujitsu controversy since September 1987, when arbitrators
announced the initial resolution of IBM's charges that Fujitsu
illegally copied IBM software.
   IBM's stock price, which had jumped $2.87{ a share on Monday in
expectations of a big payment from Fujitsu, edged back 62{ cents to
$118.25 a share by late morning today.
   The American Arbitration Association had been holding secret
hearings since then to work out the ground rules under which IBM
must grant Fujitsu access to information about the software that
runs IBM mainframe computers.
   The rules set by the two arbitrators will make it possible for
Fujitsu to develop complex, expensive software that controls the
basic operations of IBM mainframe computers.
   IBM, which dominates the world market for mainframe computers, is
the only company making the so-called operating system software for
its own machines.
   The information supplied by IBM also will make it easier for
Fujitsu to develop its own line of mainframe computers that compete
with IBM's by running the same programs. Fujitsu and Hitachi Ltd.
are IBM's two main competitors in that market. Hitachi is not
covered by the terms of the IBM-Fujitsu deal.
   IBM and Fujitsu issued brief statement today saying they were
satisfied with the results of the arbitration.
   IBM first accused Fujitsu in 1982 of illegally copying its
mainframe software. The companies reached a private settlement in
1983, but the vaguely worded agreement fell apart and IBM in 1985
asked to have the dispute settled by binding arbitration.
   IBM and Fujitsu have agreed to let the arbitrators supervise all
disputes growing out of the case until the year 2002.
   The arbitrators are Robert H. Mnookin, a Stanford University law
professor, and John L. Jones, a computer expert who is a retired
executive vice president of Norfolk Southern Corp.
   Details of their $237 million-plus payout plan include Fujitsu
providing IBM $396 million for a paid-up license on use of IBM
programs covered under the 1983 agreement, of which Fujitsu already
has paid $125 million.
   The arbitrators said Fujitsu also was entitled to a refund of $34
million out of the $471 million it had paid IBM under the 1983
agreement. Fujitsu had made an intial payment of $65 million and
semi-annual payments of $406 million that ended last year.
   In addition, Fujitsu will pay IBM between $26 million and $51
million in 1989 for the right to examine information about IBM
mainframe software. The amount depends on how much material Fujitsu
uses. For years after 1989 the arbitrators will decide how much
Fujitsu must pay IBM.

   Grain and soybean futures were narrowly mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after opening
slightly lower.
   The wheat market got a bit of a boost on prospects for a pickup
in export sales and in response to an Agriculture Department report
indicating an increase in export shipments last week, analysts said.
   Corn was up slightly on buying by traders who had sold borrowed
contracts earlier, and soybeans were little changed.
   Analysts said the opening sell-off, like the previous day's sharp
decline, seemed tied to disappointment that the U.S.-Soviet grain
deal signed Monday was only a 27-month extension of a 5-year pact
that expired on Sept. 30.
   ``I think we're getting, in all these markets, some general
disappointment that the grain agreement really didn't have anything
new to offer from the old agreement,'' said Walter Spilka, an
analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to { cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.19 a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.58} a bushel; oats were
{ cent to 2{ cents lower with December at $2.02{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with January at $7.49{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while pork futures were mostly higher.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .13 cent higher with December
at 73.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20
cent higher with January at 82.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .02
cent lower to .45 cent higher with December at 40 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .48 cent higher with February
at 43.22 cents a pound.
   Cattle settled lower on Monday and pork futures finished higher.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. stockholders are facing another
moment of reckoning, either to sell their shares and make a windfall
profit or to sit tight for the next unpredictable chapter in
history's biggest corporate takeover battle.
   A company-imposed deadline for a second round of
multibillion-dollar bids to buy the food and tobacco conglomerate
was scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. today, and no decisions were
expected before Wednesday.
   Speculation that new, fatter offers would emerge pushed RJR
Nabisco's stock price up $1 a share Monday to $89, more than 50
percent above its value before the takeover saga began two months
ago. The stock rose another 87{ cents by late this morning in heavy
trading.
   At least two of the three known bidders _ an RJR Nabisco
management group and the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. _ were working on revised proposals, according to people
familiar with the bidding process.
   There was no indication Monday whether the third contender, a
group led by the investment firm First Boston Corp., planned to
alter its bid, which in the first round was considered the riskiest
but potentially the richest.
   A special committee of RJR Nabisco's outside directors,
conducting the auction for the nation's 19th largest industrial
company, declined comment on whether any additional bidders had
emerged.
   But officials of Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco had said previously
that the structure for evaluating all offers would remain unchanged
from the first round, which took place Nov. 18-20.
   In that process, proposals were submitted in secret to a New York
law firm representing the special committee, followed by a analysis
of what they were worth and an announcement of the committee's
intentions.
   The outside directors extended the auction after the first round
ended, reflecting their view that those proposals were inadequate in
substance and price.
   RJR Nabisco's management offered $100 a share in cash and
securities for a total of about $22.7 billion. Kohlberg Kravis
offered $94 a share in cash and securities, or $21.3 billion. First
Boston said it might offer $105 to $118 a share in cash and
securities, or $23.8 billion to $26.8 billion.
   Wall Street strategists speaking on condition they not be
identified said there was a widespread presumption that the RJR
Nabisco management group and Kohlberg Kravis would have to raise
their previous offers to at least match the potential worth of the
First Boston proposal.
   Of the three bidders, the most uncertainty surrounded First
Boston, which in its original offer proposed using a tax loophole
that expires at the end of this year to raise the value of its offer
above the others.
   Under the original plan, the First Boston group would buy RJR
Nabisco's tobacco business with a so-called installment note, which
would not be subject to a capital gains tax for a number of years,
thereby giving the firm additional money to pay shareholders a
fatter price.
   But that part of the transaction would have to be completed by
Dec. 31 because Congress closed the loophole on this capital-gains
deferment, leaving many tax experts skeptical about whether First
Boston's offer was realistic.
   The struggle for RJR Nabisco began in late October when the
management group led by its chairman, F. Ross Johnson, said it was
considering a debt-financed acquisition of the company, maker of
hundreds of products ranging from Salem cigarettes to Del Monte
canned fruits.
   The amount and heavy use of borrowed money in the takeover plans
so far have dwarfed all records and incited critical scrutiny of
such debt-financed deals. In recent years, such deals have enriched
many investors but raised questions about the economic impact of the
additional debt load on the companies.

   Stock prices drifted aimlessly today after the
government's report on the gross national product had little impact
on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fluctuated in a
narrow range through the morning, and was up 4.26 to 2,085.70 as of
noon EST.
   Declining issues were neck-and-neck with advancers, with 626
stocks falling, 619 rising and 526 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Among broader indicators, the NYSE index of all its listed stocks
was up 0.16 to 151.41, while the American Stock Exchange's market
value index slipped 0.43 to 291.24.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled a light 51.13 million shares by
midday.
   The Commerce Department said the economy, as measured by the GNP,
expanded at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter.
That was up from the government's preliminary estimate last month of
2.2 percent growth, but below the 2.9 percent to 3 percent expected
by Wall Street, said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The GNP news sent the dollar lower and bond prices higher, and
therefore had a neutral effect on stock trading, Wachtel said.
   Analysts said many investors were waiting for Friday's
unemployment figures from the Labor Department, which might give
some clue as to whether the Federal Reserve Board is likely to
tighten or relax credit.
   Traders anticipated the Fed would raise its discount rate, but in
the meantime, the market was meandering without conviction or
direction, said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co.
   ``They're waiting for the bad news to get out and over with,'' he
said.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE today was Northeast
Utilities, which was unchanged at 20].
   RJR Nabisco was up ~ at 89~ as today's 5 p.m. EST deadline for
bids for the tobacco and food company neared.
   IBM was down \ to 118| after arbitrators announced Fujitsu Ltd.
would pay the computer giant hundreds of millions of dollars for the
use of information about the software that runs IBM mainframe
computers. The market had expected IBM would receive a much larger
award.
   TW Services was up 2] to 24~ after Coniston Partners said it had
received enough TW shares to boost its stake in the company to 81.3
percent. Coniston has offered to buy the food services firm for $29
a share, or $1.14 billion.

   Spending time at the mall has been raised
to an art form by some high school students, but at Youngstown State
University it's a management science.
   The school has just produced its first two graduates in shopping
center management, and the trainees are finding a bull market for
their specialized skills.
   ``It was kind of my destiny that I showed up and they had the
major,'' said Tracey Farley, a former administrative assistant to a
Virginia shopping mall manager and one of the first to earn a mall
degree.
   ``Ever since I started at the mall in Virginia Beach, I knew
shopping malls were never going to die,'' said Ms. Farley, 24, who
worked 2{ years for mall developer Melvin Simon & Associates.
   The study of malls _ and how to run them _ leads to a bachelor of
science degree in business administration at Youngstown.
   Before the university started the program, shopping center
management was mostly taught in seminars offered to established
shopping mall developers by the International Council of Shopping
Centers, said Don Pendley, spokesman for the group.
   ``This is a major move by a school. There aren't many
institutions that talk about shopping malls at all,'' said Pendley.
   The industry has had three years of record growth with 21
regional malls of at least 400,000 square feet _ each the size of 10
football fields _ built last year, Pendley said. He said that
overall, construction began on 1,846 new shopping centers last year.
   Pendley said the council is helping develop training programs for
graduate students at Harvard University and the University of
Pennsylvania.
   ``They're looking for somebody to professionalize the development
and management of centers, in this case,'' he said.
   Youngstown State's involvement in training shopping mall managers
began in 1985 when developers offered to help train managers for the
growing field, said E. Terry Diederick, a business professor who
directs the shopping center major.
   ``They've been very supportive and they've been a major source of
expertise. They've served as lecturers and have been very helpful in
placing our students,'' he said.
   Among those offering to help train the students were the locally
based Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. and the Cafaro Corp. _ two of the
country's largest shopping center developers.
   The major, which has attracted 25 students this year, requires
business school students to take courses in the history and planning
of retail sales, shopping center operations and problems surrounding
development, Diederick said.
   He said students are also required to work at internships with
developers.
   ``We draw on property management concepts that aren't really
talked about in other courses,'' said Diederick in describing what
sets the course apart from other business programs.
   ``A mall is much like a city, and they (the students) have to
have a lot of those skills,'' said the professor.
   Among the topics students explore are police science, engineering
and traffic control, Diederick said.
   ``The shopping center industry has grown dramatically and it has
gotten to the point that education has to be specific to that
industry,'' said John Richley, director of operations for Cafaro.
   About 55 percent of all retail dollars spent in the United States
last year went to stores in shopping malls, Pendley said. He said
that with that figure growing at half a percent a year, the council
projects sharply increased demand from shopping center owners for
trained managers.
   Ms. Farley, for instance, said she is weighing job offers from
Melvin Simon, DeBartolo and Cafaro, as well as several other
shopping center developers. And she said that until other business
schools start to copy Youngstown State's program, she doesn't expect
much competition for the jobs she wants.
   ``Right now during this period there is no way you can get a view
of what the industry is about in any other classroom setting,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Houses, Malls Encroach on California Croplands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VISALIA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The problems of attorney Dan Dooley, who
farms a small parcel east of here, show how difficult it's getting
to balance the interests of agriculture and development in
California.
   Residents in the area complain about dust, noise, bugs and
traffic congestion caused by slow-moving tractors, while farmers
suffer from vandalism to farm and irrigation equipment and trash
from weekend picnickers.
   Repeated complaints by neighbors finally forced Dooley to change
his cropping patterns.
   ``We just don't grow cotton on our ranch anymore. The conflicts
are just too severe,'' he said.
   Rapid growth in the fertile San Joaquin Valley, locked between
San Francisco and Los Angeles, may eventually ruin farming in what
is regarded as the world's richest agricultural region.
   A Department of Agriculture study shows as many as 50,000 acres
of productive crop land in the state are paved over or removed from
production each year because of urbanization.
   Air pollution primarily brought on by heavy vehicle traffic is
making serious cuts in production of some crops, such as grapes,
according to Fresno County Supervisor Vernon Conrad, a panelist at a
recent discussion here sponsored by the California Rural Development
Committee.
   ``We can preserve the land, but if we can't preserve the
production, what good is it?'' Conrad said of the air pollution
issue. ``If we don't do some planning and take care of some of the
obvious shortfalls, it's going to be too late.''
   About 815,000 acres of farm land will be lost in California
between now and the year 2000, estimated John C. Williamson, a
former assemblyman who sponsored the state's strong farmland
conservation measures in the early 1960s.
   ``All efforts now being made are inadequate for the purpose of
protecting farm land,'' Williamson said.
   Will Shafroth, director of the American Farmland Trust, agreed
that current preservation efforts are inadequate but said public
officials have a number of tools available to spare crop lands from
a layer of fresh asphalt.
   Shafroth called for strict land-use regulations to prevent
``leap-frog'' development, or housing subdivisions and industrial
parks situated in the middle of productive fields. Such development
in North Natomas area of Sacramento County has led to the demise of
once-productive rice farms.
   Eugene Smith, planning and development director for Tulare
County, said planners must regard agriculture as an industry when
examining housing development proposals.
   ``Just as locating a residence in an industrial park leads to
conflict and does not make sense, locating a residence in the middle
of an agricultural area does not make sense,'' said Smith.
   ``Rural residential growth right now in the San Joaquin Valley is
the greatest threat to preservation of farm land,'' Smith said.
   The practice of splitting off small parcels of the farm so family
members can build homes or ``rural ranchettes'' is a common way
development encroaches on agriculture, he said.
   Dooley said his farm can't use certain chemicals because of the
nearby homes, and the materials he does use can only be applied by
ground spray rigs, not by aerial cropdusters.
   To keep developers at bay, farmers are being encouraged to retain
their land when inflated prices make selling out a lucrative option.
The sale of development rights to public agencies is another option.
   Under such agreements, a public agency pays a farm owner the
difference between the farm land's current and potential value for
housing or other urban uses. When development rights are conveyed,
future development is restricted in the property deed, but the
farmer retains ownership of the land.
   A similar concept is used to acquire land in the Lake Tahoe basin
to stop excessive development and improve environmental quality.
   While financing such a program is unclear, officials have
suggested such options as bond issues, taxes on sales of converted
farm land, or local taxing districts.

<HEAD>Honeywell To Sell Colorado Semiconductor Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. said Tuesday it plans to sell
its semiconductor operation in Colorado Springs, Colo.
   The Colorado Springs unit manufactures custom and semi-custom
integrated circuits for the computer merchant market, as well as for
Honeywell's internal needs and select military customers.
   ``The decision to sell the Colorado Springs operation is
consistent with our desire to concentrate on our core businesses,''
said James J. Renier, Honeywell president and chief executive
officer.
   ``With the divestiture of the computer business at the end of
1986 and actions since then to focus on our leadership position in
controls, we no longer need such an extensive facility for circuits
used internally, nor is it in our strategic interest to be in the
merchant chip business,'' Renier added.
   ``Except for highly proprietary circuits, most of our
semiconductor needs can be satisfied on the outside,'' he said.
   The Colorado Springs operation is part of the company's Solid
State Electronics Division, which also includes a research and
development facility in Plymouth. Honeywell had previously said it
intended to restructure the division to fit the company's strategic
direction.
   Honeywell said it would maintain the Plymouth facility as a
modest captive operation. It will transfer a limited number of
fabrication technologies and products from Colorado Springs to
Plymouth to aid in meeting future internal and military customer
requirements for proprietary integrated circuits.
   The company is seeking a buyer who will also continue to support
external customers and also Honeywell's internal requirements during
a transition period.
   About 1,100 employees work in the four-building Colorado Springs
complex and Honeywell said it expects employees to transfer to the
new owner at the time of sale.

   IC Industries Inc., the nation's second-largest
bottler of Pepsi-Cola products, said Tuesday it had agreed to
purchase two Pepsi bottling operations in Wisconsin for an
undisclosed sum.
   The franchises in Oshkosh and Wisconsin Rapids will become part
of Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers Inc., an IC subsidiary that bottles
about 125 million cases of soda pop annually, Chicago-based IC said
in a statement.
   The Wisconsin operations, both owned by the Pennau family of
Oshkosh, bottle a total of 5 million cases annually, IC said.
   Pepsi-Cola General handles 12 percent of Pepsico Inc.'s domestic
soft-drink volume, second only to the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Group,
which is wholly owned by Pepsico and accounts for 33 percent of the
company's domestic volume.
   Pepsico, based in Purchase, N.Y., owns 20 percent of Pepsi-Cola
General.
   IC, which will change its name to Whitman Corp. on Thursday, is a
consumer goods and services company with four major operating
companies _ Pepsi-Cola General, Pet Inc., Hussman Corp. and Midas
International.

   The U.S. dollar retreated against most major
currencies in European trading Tuesday, buffeted by a
lower-than-expected growth rate for the U.S. economy. Gold prices
also slipped.
   Currency dealers said a revision of the third-quarter U.S. gross
national product _ the broadest measure of economic health _ to 2.6
percent from 2.2 percent prompted dollar selling.
   Most traders said they had anticipated growth of at least 3
percent during the July-September period.
   The British pound, however, remained strong. The currency was
helped by last week's boost in bank base interest rates by one
percentage point to 13 percent.
   Dealers said Monday's increase by major U.S. banks of their prime
lending rates, to 10.5 percent from 10 percent, wasn't a sufficient
incentive for the markets to switch from pounds to dollars.
   British rates are now the highest of all leading Western
economies, making the pound one of the more attractive currencies.
Dealers said the British central bank intervened to sell some pounds
for dollars Tuesday in an attempt to slow sterling's gain.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8425, more expensive for
buyers than Monday's $1.8385.
   Other late rates in Europe compared with Monday's late rates:
1.7285 West German marks, down from 1.7332; 1.4481 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4515; 5.9125 French francs, down from 5.9225; 1.9530
Dutch guilders, down from 1.9547; 1,281.25 Italian lire, down from
1,285.50; and 1.1930 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1918.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 122.15 Japanese yen, up
from 122.00. In London the dollar traded lower at 121.65 yen.
   Gold bullion prices were around a dollar lower in Europe after
rising earlier in Hong Kong.
   In London, the major European trading center for the precious
metal, gold closed at $422.75 a troy ounce, down from $423.85. The
Zurich closing price was $422.25 an ounce, down from $423.25.
   Hong Kong gold closed at a bid $423.31 an ounce, up from $422.02.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.09 a troy ounce, down

   Futures prices of wheat, corn and soybeans closed
mostly higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late flurry
of buying by traders who had sold contracts earlier in the session.
   Analysts attributed the closing rally almost entirely to
``short-covering,'' a form of profit-taking that amounts to selling
high, then buying low instead of buying low, then selling high.
   ``The last 10 minutes just turned into a very good rally on
short-covering,'' said Jon Horton, a research analyst with Research
Department Inc., a Chicago-based analytical firm. ``They just ran
out of selling there toward the close and everyone started to
cover.''
   Oat futures plunged for the second day in a row in a continuing
reaction to abundant supplies of feed-quality oats, said Jay Homan,
an independent trader.
   Homan also said the oat market was shrinking away from the
inflated prices caused by drought-related panic buying during the
summer.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 5 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.23{ a bushel; corn

<TEXT>
   New construction contracts rose slightly in
October after a three-month slump, on the strength of residential
building everywhere except in the Northeast, a business-research
company reported Tuesday.
   The F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co. said
that new construction projects last month were up 1 percent to an
annualized value of $240.2 billion. Construction contracts fell 3
percent in September, following drops in the previous two months.
   George A. Christie, a McGraw-Hill economist, said that while the
October improvement was welcome, it ``should be interpreted as a
pause rather than a turnaround for the sagging construction sector.''
   ``The prospect of a post-election rise of interest rates presents
the risk of a further setback for this credit-sensitive industry,''
Christie said. ``Housing, which provided most of October's support,
is especially vulnerable.''
   Housing starts were up by about 7 percent in October, with the
value of contracts for one- and multi-family houses rising 4 percent
to an annualized $120.8 billion, the report said.
   The report said that all regions shared in the improved housing
activity but the Northeast, which experienced a 10 percent decline
from September's rate of contracting.
   October contracting for nonresidential buildings fell 8 percent
to an annualized $75.6 billion, the report said. It said the biggest
declines were in office buildings, down 23 percent, and in schools,
down 22 percent.
   For the first 10 months, new construction starts on an unadjusted
basis totaled $213.4 billion, down 3 percent from the same period in
1987, the report said. The South, with a shortfall of 6 percent,
remained the nation's weakest building market in 1988, while the
West held even with last year, it said.

<HEAD>Shareholder Windfalls From Megadeals: Where Will All That Money Go?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billions of dollars in potential shareholder
profits from two staggering takeover deals have aroused a debate
over how the money will be reinvested, with some strategists saying
the outcome could determine the future direction of stocks and the
economy.
   In one of the biggest takeovers ever, Philip Morris Cos. will buy
Kraft Inc. for $12.6 billion or $106 a share. For owners of Kraft
shares prior to the takeover plan _ first disclosed last month, when
the stock traded at about $60 _ that represents a profit of more
than 76 percent.
   An even bigger deal looms for RJR Nabisco Inc., which has been
the target of competing bids valued at between $21.3 billion to
$26.8 billion, or $94 a share to $118 as share.
   For holders of RJR shares, which traded at about $56 in
mid-October, that means a potential maximum profit of nearly 111
percent.
   If a significant part of the money from the megadeals is plowed
back into the stock market, it would be considered a strong sign of
confidence that the country is growing and recession is unlikely for
a while.
   On the other hand, if most of the money goes into
interest-bearing accounts or government bonds, it will reinforce
fears that stocks will head lower and an economic downturn isn't far
off.
   ``My opinion is the stock market is in a major peak,'' said
Charles M. LaLoggia, author of Special Situation Report, a widely
followed market newsletter based in Rochester, N.Y.
   ``My advice, to anybody lucky enough to own stock in a takeover
target taken out in a peak, is to put it to work in a Treasury
bill,'' LaLoggia said.
   A few optimists have predicted that because of the sheer volume
of this money, some will find its way into the stock market and
could serve as the octane to drive up prices, perhaps snapping Wall
Street out of its slump.
   But the prevailing view appears to be that most shareholders _
the majority of them large institutional investors _ likely will
park their profits in safe, short-term government Treasury bonds.
   The 8.3 percent yield of a three-month Treasury bill represents a
better investment than components of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index, a widely watched barometer of the general stock market's
health, which has risen about 8.7 percent the entire year.
   ``With interest rates moving up, and three-month Treasuries
yielding more than 8 percent, it's hard to justify giving up that
safety for the risk of the stock market,'' said David Blitzer, chief
economist for Standard & Poor's Corp.
   ``That suggests to me that whoever owns shares in whatever
celebrated buyout is going on, if he listens to most investment
advisers, he won't put it back into the stock market,'' Blitzer
said. ``He'll wait for a sunnier day.''
   Countering this view is the theory that while demand for stocks
continues, the number of stocks is shrinking, partly because of
takeovers and mergers such as the Kraft and RJR Nabisco deals.
According to Federal Reserve figures, the amount of available stock
has shrunk by about $75 billion in each of the past two years.
   If that's true, some strategists say, simple laws of supply and
demand will dictate that stock prices rise, making them more
attractive and drawing more investors _ including those who made
windfall profits in the two big takeovers.
   ``I would assume part of that money would be going into the stock
market,'' said Rao Chalasani, a market strategist at the
Cleveland-based firm Prescott Ball & Turben Inc.
   ``I think there are other stocks priced similarly to those two
companies prior to when the takeovers were announced,'' he said.
``Some of the money would go into these companies, regardless of
whether they will be taken over.''
   Others say the supply-demand theory is a fiction promoted by the
securities industry when it's clear the stock market has hit a
cyclical high.
   ``I regard all the work I've seen that says there's a
supply-demand situation to be nonsense,'' said James Cramer, owner
of Cramer & Co., a New York money management firm.
   ``The main reason is, you can buy all the GE you want, you can
buy all the IBM you want, and the prices aren't rising,'' he said.
``There are too many stocks that nobody wants and too few that
everybody wants.''

   Stock prices closed higher today as a rally in
the dollar and Treasury bonds helped Wall Street break out the
doldrums.
   However, volume was light, and analysts said investors were
waiting for Friday's unemployment figures from the Labor Department,
which might give some clue as to whether the Federal Reserve Board
is likely to tighten or relax credit.
   The market meandered its way through the first few hours of
trading, fluctuating in a narrow range as it did on Monday.
   But in the early afternoon, program buying set in and investors
responded to firmness in the bond market and an improvement by the
dollar, said Peter Vandenberg, a market analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Ralph Acampora, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co., said Wall
Street's oversold condition has cleared the way for buying.
   ``I think the negatives are all on the table,'' he said.
``Eveyrone who wanted to sell, sold.''
   More traders didn't join today's rally because ``no one believes
it,'' he said.
   The Commerce Department reported today that the economy, as
measured by the GNP, expanded at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate
in the third quarter. That was up from the government's preliminary
estimate last month of 2.2 percent growth.
   Analysts said the report had a muted effect on Wall Street.

   President Reagan, in his final budget, will
make one last effort to overhaul the way Congress parcels out money,
including recommending a switch from 1-year to 2-year spending
plans, administration sources said Tuesday.
   Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president
will submit a laundry list of recommended changes in the way the
appropriations process works.
   Many of these proposals are ones that Reagan has sought
repeatedly during his White House tenure, such as presidential
authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills and a
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.
   While Reagan will leave office without getting any of his pet
reforms adopted, advisers to President-elect George Bush have
indicated that Bush will pursue the fight for at least some of the
changes.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who will stay on in the Bush
administration, has been particularly supportive of the 2-year
budget cycle.
   ``The planning for the federal government is so hectic that if we
can get it on a 2-year basis we would greatly improve the process
and I think that many in Congress feel the same way,'' Brady has
said.
   Currently, Congress must review agencies' requests for funds each
year and pass a spending plan for the budget year, which begins Oct.
1. The deliberations consume hundreds of hours for lawmakers, who
often miss the start of the fiscal year and are forced to pass a
stopgap spending measure to keep the government from shutting down.
   In his State of the Union address last January, Reagan called for
a switch to a 2-year budget cycle, proposing that Congress try the
approach on a trial basis covering defense spending for two years.
The effort was short-circuited, however, when Congress and the
administration were forced to enter budget summit negotiations late
last year following the collapse of the stock market.
   Reagan has encountered stiff opposition in the past to his ideas
for budget reform, primarily because many of them involve shifting
power from Congress to the president.
   But some officials suggested that with a new administration and
the urgent need to deal with the budget deficit, it was possible
that reforming the budget process would gain momentum.
   Many are looking to the National Economic Commission, a
high-level advisory panel on the deficit, to take the lead in
recommending ways to streamline the budget process.
   Several members of the commission, including former Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger, have said they believe reforming the
process should be a top priority in any deficit-reduction plan.
   According to sources, these are the proposals the president is
expected to make on Jan. 9 when he sends his final budget to
Congress:
   _2-YEAR BUDGET CYCLE. Reagan has said that a 2-year budget would
eliminate repetitive annual budget tasks, give Congress more time
for oversight functions and eliminate budgetary gimmicks, such as
shifting spending from one year into the next to make the deficit
appear smaller.
   _LINE ITEM VETO. The president has repeatedly sought the same
power ``that 43 governors have'' to veto individual items in a
spending bill without having to reject the entire bill. The veto
could be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses.
   _BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT. Another Reagan perennial, this
constitutional amendment would require revenues and spending to be
in balance, similar to requirements in effect in many states. Along
with this, the president also supports a constitutional amendment to
require a greater-than-majority vote whenever Congress raises taxes.
   _JOINT RESOLUTION. Currently, Congress passes a joint resolution
early in the budget process that provides the broad outlines for
spending and taxes, but this proposal is not subject to presidential
review. Reagan wants a change to require the president's signature
on the resolution as a way of involving the executive branch in the
process.
   _PRESIDENTIAL CUTS. The president under current law must ask
Congress for permission if he decides not to spend money the
lawmakers appropriate. The request, known as a ``rescission,''
however, can simply be ignored by Congress, forcing the president to
go ahead and spend the money. Reagan wants to require Congress to go
on record with an up-or-down vote each time a president asks for
authority not to spend money.
   _INDIVIDUAL SPENDING BILLS. Congress is supposed to appropriate
money through 13 separate spending bills but occasionally ends up
passing a catchall bill with up to two-thirds of the government's
spending crammed into one massive document. For the first time since
1976, Congress was able to get all 13 spending bills passed this
year. Reagan would like stiffer rules to make Congress live up to
this requirement.

   The value of U.S. farm exports should increase
slightly to $36.5 billion this year but the volume of sales will
fall about 8 percent lagely because of last summer's drought, the
Agriculture Department reported Tuesday.
   Export values are predicted to grow by $1 billion in fiscal 1989,
while volume will drop to 136 million metric tons, down from a
six-year high of 147.5 million metric tons in the year ended Sept.
30, according to Richard W. Goldberg, acting undersecretary of
agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs.
   Goldberg delivered what he described as a ``bright'' agricultural
trade forecast at the opening session of USDA's Agricultural Outlook
Conference, an annual event in which government analysts outline
prospects for the coming year for farmers and agribusiness.
   ``Export volume is forecast smaller as the U.S. share of world
trade shrinks for drought-affected products,'' Goldberg said.
   Overall, the United States is expected to account for 48 percent
of world total grain trade in 1989, down from 50 percent. One of the
hardest hit commodities is soybeans, with the U.S. share of world
soybean trade forecast to drop to 35 percent in 1989 from 49 percent.
   Although the U.S. share of world wheat trade is expected to show
a small gain in 1989, the volume of American wheat and flour exports
is forecast to fall by about 3 percent while corn exports should
grow by 2 percent, said James R. Donald, chairman of the World
Agricultural Outlook Board.
   In general, farm prices are rising because of lower global grain
stocks, mostly from the drought in North America, and Goldberg said
world prices for wheat, corn and soybeans should be their highest
since 1985.
   Goldberg said a $2.6 billion increase in the value of U.S. grain
and feed exports will offset declines for cotton and oilseeds in
1989.
   ``For U.S. agriculture, the challenge in the coming year will be
to sustain the momentum in overseas sales which has been regained
over the past few years,'' Goldberg said. ``This will require more
competitive prices, aggressive market development, persistent trade
policy efforts and a market-oriented trade philosophy.''
   Donald reported that U.S. farmers probably will receive less cash
income but higher net income next year in the aftermath of the
summer drought. Consumers are expected to pay 3 percent to 5 percent
more for food in 1989, compared with about a 4 percent increase this
year.
   Smaller crop supplies, firm demand and higher prices are shaping
the global agricultural outlook for 1989, according to Donald.
   Expanded output appears likely in the second half of 1989, and he
said continued large supplies of animal products probably will
dampen livestock price increases.
   Still, American farmers can expect slightly higher receipts when
they market their crops and livestock in 1989, Donald said.
   ``But they will be getting less in direct government payments and
their production expenses will rise with expanded acreage and
costlier production inputs,'' Donald said.
   Cash income therefore is likely to decline by about 10 percent
from this year's record-tying estimated level of $56 billion to $58
billion, he said.
   In contrast, Donald said, net farm income is expected to about 20
percent above this year's estimated level of $38 billion to $40
billion.
   ``The 1989 outlook favors the food shopper, even though the
drought trimmed potential meat output,'' Donald said. He said meat
supplies would be the second largest ever, boosted by sizable pork
supplies and even greater poultry supplies.

   Fujitsu Ltd. will pay International Business
Machines Corp. $237 million in the next two weeks and millions more
in coming years in return for secrets about the software that runs
IBM mainframe computers, arbitrators said Tuesday.
   The arbitrators' binding order ends a bitter dispute that began
in 1982, when IBM accused Fujitsu of copying the complex base-layer
software that runs IBM's most powerful computers.
   The arbitrators, Robert H. Mnookin and John L. Jones, compensated
IBM for the information it must surrender while removing doubt about
the legality of compatible software developed by Fujitsu.
   ``The arbitrators, Solomon-like, solved a dilemma in that both
sides get what they want,'' said Michael Geran, an analyst for Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc.
   Both companies issued written statements expressing satisfaction
with the order but were forbidden by the arbitrators from commenting
further.
   Analysts said the amount of money being paid to the world's
largest computer company was less important than the affirmation of
its property rights and the limits on information Fujitsu can obtain.
   ``IBM came out ahead on the arbitration. What IBM gave up was
limited, and they got back a nice sum of money,'' said Steven Cohen,
an analyst at Soundview Financial Group in Stamford, Conn.
   Fujitsu, Japan's biggest computer maker, has already paid $471
million to IBM under a defunct 1983 accord and $125 million as
partial payment for a paid-up license covering future use of
previously released Fujitsu programs, some of which contain IBM
programming material.
   In addition to the $237 million that remains to be paid on the
paid-up license, Fujitsu will make annual payments each year through
June 25, 1997, for use of new IBM programming material.The
arbitrators will decide how big the payments will be. In 1989, the
fee will be between $26 million and $51 million.
   By the end of the century, Fujitsu's overall payments to IBM
could exceed $1 billion.
   IBM's stock rose 50 cents a share to $119.37{ Tuesday in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, after rising $2.87{ a
share Monday on anticipation of the announcement. The announcement
was made after the close of Tuesday's trading of Fujitsu stock in
Tokyo.
   The companies reached a private settlement in 1983, but the
vaguely worded agreement fell apart and IBM in 1985 asked to have
the dispute settled by binding arbitration.
   The American Arbitration Association gave the case to Mnookin, a
Stanford University law professor, and Jones, a retired computer
expert from Norfolk Southern Corp. The men announced a preliminary
agreement in September 1987.
   In addition to specifying payments, the arbitrators' new order
spells out the ground rules under which Fujitsu engineers may
examine IBM software in a secure location that will be set up in
Japan.
   Fujitsu makes computers and base-layer software that are intended
to run the same programs as the mainframe computers made by IBM.
However, slight discrepancies in the two companies' base-layer
software, known as the operating system, mean that Fujitsu's
computers have not been entirely compatible with IBM's.
   The arbitrators' order will give Fujitsu enough information so
that Fujitsu computers and base software should be able to run all
IBM mainframe software without modification.
   But Fujitsu will still have to do its own programming.
   ``Fujitsu can't just take a reel of tape from IBM, copy it and
send it out to all their customers,'' Cohen said.
   The arbitrators decided Fujitsu deserved the inside information
from IBM out of fairness to Fujitsu customers and to the company
itself, which began copying IBM's base software at a time when its
legal property status was unclear.
   Fujitsu's mainframe computers are sold mainly in Japan and in
Europe, where some are marketed by Siemens AG.
   Japan's Hitachi Ltd. and Amdahl Corp., a U.S. company that is
partly owned by Fujitsu, also compete in the market for
IBM-compatible mainframes. But they do not produce their own base
software. Customers of those companies buy their operating system
software from IBM.
   Frank Gens, an analyst at International Data Corp., predicted
that IBM and Fujitsu would continue to do battle before the
arbitrators on interpretation of the terms of the order.
   Protracted battles would hurt Fujitsu, which needs to get
information as quickly as possible to stay current with IBM. The
arbitrators will have jurisdiction over the companies' interactions
through Nov. 29, 2002.

   Wall Street broke free of the doldrums Tuesday,
rallying on strength in the dollar and Treasury bonds.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.09 to 2,101.53.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a margin of about
12-to-7 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 938 issues up, 551 down and 478 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 127.42 million shares, up
from 123.48 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 155
million shares.
   Wall Street began the day where it left off on Monday, drifting
aimlessly for several hours, but the market picked up steam in the
afternoon. Analysts theorized the market's oversold condition made
stocks ripe for gains, and improvements in the dollar and Treasury
bond prices were reason enough for investors to start buying.
   ``I think the negatives are all on the table,'' said Ralph
Acampora, a market analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co. ``Everyone who
wanted to sell, sold.''
   With those negatives _ such as rising interest rates _ discounted
by investors, the market had a better tone, Acampora said.
   Analysts said program buying also added fuel to the rally, but
Tuesday's low volume was evidence that traders were still
mistrustful.
   ``No one believes it,'' Acampora said. ``They won't believe it
until it has muscle.''
   Many investors were on the sidelines, waiting for Friday's
unemployment figures from the Labor Department that might give some
clue as to whether the Federal Reserve Board will tighten or relax
credit.
   Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said the market
expected the Fed to raise its discount rate.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the economy, as
measured by the gross national product, expanded at a moderate 2.6
percent annual rate in the third quarter. That was up from the
government's preliminary estimate last month of 2.2 percent growth,
but analysts said the report had a muted effect on Wall Street.
   RJR Nabisco, which rose 1~ to 90~, was the most actively traded
issue on the NYSE as investors jockeyed for position in advance of
Tuesday's 5 p.m. EST deadline for takeover bids for the food and
tobacco giant.
   Among blue-chip winners, General Motors was up 1| to 83~, Ford
Motor picked up 1] to close at 51\, Procter & Gamble jumped 1[ to
81| and Coca Cola rose 1 to 43.
   IBM closed up { at 119] after arbitrators ordered Fujitsu Ltd. to
pay the computer giant hundreds of millions of dollars for the use
of information about the software that runs IBM mainframe computers.
The market, which had bid IBM stock up 2~ on Monday, expected the
company to receive a much larger award.
   Among the decliners, AT&T slipped ] to 29 and Control Data fell {
to 17{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $19.819 billion, or 0.75
percent, in value.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.18 to 152.43.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 2.54 to 311.96, and S&P's
500-stock composite index picked up 2.27 to 270.91.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.06 to 368.15.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.53
to 292.20.

   The dollar dropped sharply and then recovered
most of its ground Tuesday in a confused session dominated by
speculation about the direction of U.S. interest rates.
   The dollar declined after the government reported an upward
revision in the third-quarter U.S. gross national product to 2.6
percent from 2.2 percent.
   Some traders said the dollar fell because the market had been
anticipating growth of closer to 3 percent during the July-September
period. Others said the growth was healthy and did not account
entirely for the dollar's drop.
   The dollar's rise, which picked up momentum in the early
afternoon in New York, appeared to be unrelated to any economic
news, traders said.
   Some big banks may have bid the dollar up in an effort to put a
squeeze on ``shorts'' _ that is, traders who had borrowed dollars in
hopes that the currency would decline and they would be able to make
a profit by paying back the lenders with cheaper dollars, said James
M. Pugh, vice president for foreign exchange at Bear, Stearns & Co.
   ``It caught a lot of people by surprise,'' said John Lyman,
senior corporate foreign-exchange dealer for the Bank of Tokyo in
New York.
   Traders were looking ahead to Friday's report on U.S.
unemployment in November, which could give a hint about the Federal
Reserve's future monetary policy.
   Traders have chosen to focus in recent weeks on the outlook for
interest rates in the United States. Tighter monetary policy would
push up short-term U.S. interest rates, making dollar-denominated
securities more attractive to investors.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8425, more expensive for
buyers than Monday's $1.8385. Later in New York, the pound rose to
$1.8443 from $1.8399 Monday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 122.15 Japanese yen, up from
122.00. In London the dollar traded lower at 121.65 yen. In New
York, the dollar fell to 121.83 yen from 122.28 yen Monday.
   Other late rates in New York, compared with Monday's late rates,
included: 1.7348 West German marks, down from 1.7355; 1.4500 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4524; 1.1913 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1931;
5.9310 French francs, up from 5.9273; and 1,282.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,286.25.
   Other late rates in Europe, compared with Monday's late rates,
included: 1.7285 West German marks, down from 1.7332; 1.4481 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4515; 5.9125 French francs, down from 5.9225;
1.9530 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9547; 1,281.25 Italian lire, down
from 1,285.50; and 1.1930 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1918.
   Gold prices rose in Asian trading but fell later in the day in
Europe and the United States.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $423.31 an ounce, up from
$422.02.
   In London, the major European trading center for the precious
metal, gold closed at $422.75 a troy ounce, down from $423.85. The
closing price in Zurich, Switzerland, was $422.25 an ounce, down
from $423.25.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $421.90 a troy ounce from $423.30.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was
bid at $421.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $422.10 late
Monday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.09 a troy ounce, down
from $6.16. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery
fell to $6.030 a troy ounce from $6.113 late Monday.

<HEAD>Coniston Extends $29-a-Share Offer to All of TW Service Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investor group pursuing TW Services Inc. said
Tuesday its tender offer for some of TW Services' shares attracted
about twice as many shares as sought and that it was extending its
$29-a-share offer to all of the food services company's stock.
   The group, Coniston Partners, said its amended offer of $1.14
billion in cash for the 81 percent of TW Services that it does not
already own would expire at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 13.
   Coniston also said it had asked the Delaware Chancery Court to
require the TW Services board to redeem or invalidate the
poison-pill rights that would otherwise make its bid for control of
the company prohibitively expensive.
   In response, TW Services said its board would consider Coniston's
amended offer ``in due course.''
   Its chairman and chief executive, Frank L. Salizzoni, said the
substantial number of shares tendered was ``irrelevant'' because the
partial tender was ``designed from the outset to stampede
shareholders into tendering their stock in hopes of forcing the
company into another transaction.''
   He said the amended Coniston offer for all TW stock ``remains
highly conditional.''
   ``Given that it is conditioned, among other things, on TW
Services entering into a satisfactory merger agreement, it remains
merely an invitation to enter merger negotiations,'' he said in a
statement.
   Coniston, a New York-based investment firm that already owns
about 9.3 million of TW Services' 48.6 million shares, launched a
tender offer for 15.75 million of TW Services shares in late October.
   The combination of those shares with what Coniston already owned
would give it about 51 percent of the company.
   Coniston said that when its partial tender offer expired at 12:01
a.m. Tuesday, nearly 30.2 million shares had been tendered which
would have given Coniston nearly 82 percent of TW Services'
outstanding shares.
   Under its two-step plan, Coniston said it would then acquire the
remaining shares in a merger for $29 a share in cash.
   Coniston said the two-step plan was devised to get around the
Delaware anti-takeover law that restricts uninvited bidders from
building a stake in a company based in that state.
   Paul E. Tierney Jr., a Coniston principal, said he expects the
only obstacle that would prevent Coniston from buying tendered stock
after its offer expires next month would be the poison pill.
   Coniston has said that if it acquires TW Services, it plans to
sell the company's health services operations, which include 27
skilled nursing facilities and two retirement living centers.
   TW Services' other operations include 1,200 Denny's restaurants,
400 Hardee's fast-food restaurants and Canteen Corp., a food
services company.

<HEAD>Sugar Rallies On Supply Fears, Technical Factors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices surged Tuesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange despite a lack of fresh news, a sign of the market's
increasing concern about the possibility of a supply shortage,
analysts said.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans finished mostly higher;
energy futures were mixed; precious metals were lower; livestock and
meat were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Sugar for delivery in March settled .33 cent higher at 11.30
cents a pound, the contract's highest close since Aug. 8, which also
was the last day March sugar closed above 11 cents.
   During Tuesday's session, the March contract traded as high as
11.33 cents a pound, challenging the previous day's intra-day peak
of 11.34 cents, a four-month high.
   Since falling below 9 cents a pound in late September, sugar
futures have risen fairly steadily on indications that world sugar
production in the current crop year may fall short of consumption,
reducing already-low inventories to critical levels.
   The United States, China and the Soviet Union all are rumored to
be looking for more sugar in the September-through-August crop year,
yet Cuba reportedly has asked China to accept deferred delivery of
scheduled shipments, analysts said.
   Last week, the West German statistics firm F.O. Licht reduced its
estimate of this year's European sugar-beet crop by 750,000 metric
tons, increasing fears of a production defict instead of the surplus
that had been expected only a few months ago.
   ``There have been concerns that if there is a sudden increase in
demand from the physical market, the sugar might not be available.
Now that there's the possibility of a production deficit, those
concerns are being felt even more strongly,'' said Judith Ganes, a
sugar market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York said technical signals _ the chart patterns on which many
speculators base their trading decisions _ were extremely bullish.
   Wheat, corn and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a late flurry of buying by traders who had
sold contracts earlier in the session.
   Analysts attributed the closing rally almost entirely to
``short-covering,'' a form of profit-taking that amounts to selling
high, then buying low instead of buying low, then selling high.
   Oat futures plunged for the second straight day in a continuing
reaction to abundant supplies of feed-quality oats, said Jay Homan,
an independent trader.
   Homan also said the oat market was shrinking away from the
inflated prices caused by drought-related panic buying during the
summer.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 5 cents higher with December at $4.23{ a
bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$2.56} a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 9{ cents lower with December
at $1.95{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 4\ cents higher with
January at $7.53} a bushel.
   Energy futures settled mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange
as the markets began consolidating the sharp gains of recent
sessions.
   After the close of trading, the American Petroleum Institute
released figures showing a 2.7 million-barrel drawdown in U.S.
crude-oil stocks and a 2.5-million-barrel decline in U.S. gasoline
stocks last week. Stocks of petroleum distillates increased by 1.76
million barrels, according to the API.
   Crude futures were expected to open higher Wednesday in reaction
to the report.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 11 cents lower to 15 cents
higher with January at $14.92 a barrel; heating oil was .86 cent
lower to .80 cent higher with December at 47.79 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .01 cent lower to .70 cent higher with
December at 46.87 cents a gallon.
   Intra-day weakness in crude prices, coupled with the weakness of
the dollar pressured precious-metals futures on New York's Commodity
Exchange, said Bernard Savaiko, a metals analyst with PaineWebber
Inc. in New York.
   Gold settled 50 cents to $1.40 lower with December at $421.90 a
troy ounce; silver was 8.5 cents to 9 cents lower with December at
$6.03 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .10 cent
to .47 cent lower with December at 73.10 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .15 cent lower to .25 cent higher with January at 82.70
cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent lower to .45 cent higher with
December at 39.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent
to .13 cent lower with February at 43.05 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced moderately on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled 2.20 points higher at 271.15. The contract is
worth $500 a point.

   Campeau Corp. announced Tuesday it is selling its
Ann Taylor division for $430 million to an investor group that
includes the specialty store chain's management and Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets.
   The group also includes Joseph E. Brooks, former chairman of Lord

department stores.
   Allied includes Bon Marche, Maas Brothers, Jordan Marsh and
Sterns department stores, while Campeau's Federated Department
Stores unit comprises the Bloomingdale's, Goldsmith's, Lazarus,
Burdine's, Abraham and Straus and Rich's chains.
   Ann Taylor, which operates 114 upscale clothing stores, had 1987
sales of $249 million.

   Interco Inc. said Tuesday that it had obtained
definitive financing and was mailing the cash portion of the special
dividends it had declared to ward off a $2.7 billion hostile
takeover.
   As announced earlier, the special dividends for the restructuring
and recapitalization amounted to $38.60 per share of Interco common
stock. The company said checks in the amount of $14.221 per share
were being mailed to shareholders of record as of the close of
business on Oct. 13, and checks for $24.379 are being sent to
shareholders of record as of the close of business on Nov. 22.
   Interco said it had been advised by the New York Stock Exchange
that shares of Interco common will trade ``ex-dividend'' with
respect to the cash portions of the special dividends on Wednesday.
   The $2.8 billion Interco restructuring plan was valued by the
company at $76 per share.
   Cardinal Acquisition Corp., headed by brothers Steven M. and
Mitchell P. Rales of Washington, D.C., had mounted a $74-a-share
takeover attempt but the hostile tender offer expired Nov. 16 and
was not extended.

<HEAD>British Satellite Broadcasting Signs Deal With Columbia Pictures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Satellite Broadcasting, which is launching
three channels next September, announced Wednesday it has signed a
$166 million deal with Columbia Pictures Entertainment giving it
exclusive rights to movies such as ``The Last Emperor'' and the
upcoming ``Ghostbusters II.''
   The British company said the deal was the biggest ever between
Europe and Hollywood.
   The agreement means satellite TV viewers can look forward to a
host of new films from Columbia including the Oscar-winning ``The
Last Emperor,'' ``Blind Date,'' ``Roxanne,'' ``Casualties of War''
and the yet-to-be-released ``Ghostbusters II.''
   Also included in the deal are about 200 classics that include
``Stir Crazy,'' ``Tootsie,'' ``The China Syndrome,'' ``Absence of
Malice'' and ``The Way We Were.''
   Last month, the company said it had struck a $102 million deal
with MGM.
   British Satellite Broadcasting said the agreement with Columbia
brings its total of exclusive rights to films to 850.
   The company is the government-approved consortium for satellite
television and will be regulated by the Independent Broadcasting
Authority, which is responsible for commercial television.
   It will initially broadcast on three channels, Galaxy for general
entertainment, the Movie Channel and NOW for news, sport and
information.
   Last week, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said it had agreed to
carry The Disney Channel from Walt Disney Co. in the United States
to viewers in Britain and Ireland along with four other
satellite-delivered channels that it will offer next year as part of
its Sky television service.
   The agreement between News Corp. and Disney will also enable News
Corp. to use some of Disney's movies on Murdoch's pay-TV service,
Sky Movies.
   Subscribers will pay a monthly fee to receive both Sky Movies and
the Disney Channel.
   Terms of the News Corp.-Disney venture were not disclosed.

<HEAD>Government Charges GE with Defrauding Army of $10 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. and two employees were
indicted Tuesday on federal charges of hiding $10 million worth of
savings in a contract to make a battlefield computer system.
   GE, the nation's third-largest defense contractor, said the
indictment was ``unfair'' and ``sensationalized,'' adding that the
company intends to fight the charges.
   GE also said an internal investigation showed pricing
discrepancies totaling $3.69 million, which the company already has
refunded.
   GE faces a maximum penalty of $71.871 million plus restitution,
the government said.
   ``We look forward to the opportunity to have a jury judge the
merits of the case,'' said Thomas H. Lee II, first assistant U.S.
attorney.
   The defense case was not the first involving GE. In 1985, the
company pleaded guilty to unrelated contract-fraud charges.
   In Washington, the Defense Department said no decisions have been
made as yet on suspension or debarment of GE to bid on defense
contracts.
   ``The allegations will now have to be reviewed by the Army,''
said William Caldwell, a Pentagon spokesman.
   The 321-count indictment charges that GE, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary Management and Technical Services Co. in
King of Prussia, Pa., negotiated subcontracting costs less than
anticipated and hid the lower prices from the Army.
   GE was awarded a $250 million contract in June 1983 to make the
``decentralized automated service support system'' for the Army.
   The company and the two employees lied to the Defense Department
about the prices the company was paying for parts and raw materials
and double-billed for some materials, according to the indictment.
   The government also charges James Badolato, 41, of Springfield,
Pa., formerly the subcontracts manager for MATSCO, with trying to
cover up the scheme by altering dates of purchase orders and
withholding information from government auditors.
   The other employee, Gerald A. Leo, 51, of King of Prussia,
formerly the materials manager for MATSCO, was also charged with
lying to a federal auditor.
   In its statement, GE denied any criminal wrongdoing and said the
employees maintained their innocence. Leo and Badolato referred
reporters to the company attorneys.
   ``The simple fact is that the case against GE revolves around a
negotiaion in the spring of 1983 in which the two employees at MASCO
allegedly failed to notify the Army that they had succeeded in
negotiating lower subcontract prices with several vendors than had
originally been projected,'' GE said in a written statement.
   ``Any legitimate governmental interest could be served by an
appropriate civil resolution of this matter,'' GE said.
   GE is charged with five counts of mail fraud and 312 counts of
presenting false claims to the government.
   Leo was charged with racketeering, five counts of mail fraud and
two counts of making false statements and concealing material facts
from a federal agency.
   Badolato was charged with one count of racketeering, five counts
of mail fraud, one count of obstructing agency proceedings and one
count of making false statements and concealing material facts from
a federal agency.
   Leo and Badolato have since been transferred to other parts of
GE, the government said.
   In 1987, GE did $5.8 billion worth of business with the Defense
Department, the government said.
   If convicted, Leo faces a maximum of 55 years in jail, $1.276
million in fines and forfeiture of salary bonuses and company stock
derived from the racketeering. Badolato faces the same penalties
plus $5,000 more in fines if convicted.
   Nicholas C. Harbist, assistant U.S. attorney said he did not know
the amount of bonuses the men received.
   GE pleaded guilty in May 1985 to contract-fraud charges, paying a
$1.04 million fine and rembursing the government $800,000.
   The company was indicted in March 1985 for forging employee time
cards and manipulating costs to recover losses on the Minuteman
missles.

<HEAD>Church's Obtains Further Order Against Popeyes Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken to make further disclosures before it may buy
stock of Church's Fried Chicken under its $290 million hostile
buyout offer.
   Separately, Church's board of directors met in New York and
authorized management to explore alternatives to Popeyes' $8 a share
tender offer, including a possible transaction with a third party.
   San Antonio, Texas-based Church's, the nation's second-biggest
fried chicken chain, rejected Popeyes' offer as inadequate on Oct.
25, and again on Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz issued a preliminary
injunction barring Popeyes from buying Church's stock until 10
business days after it makes certain disclosures regarding its
alleged use of non-public corporate information.
   Church's has contended that its former chief financial officer,
Lewis B. Kilbourne, took confidential inside corporate information
with him when he was hired by New Orleans-based Popeyes, the
nation's No. 3 chicken chain.
   Church's also contened Popeyes financial adviser, Wasserstein,
Perrella & Co., relied on that information in formulating the
takeover bid.
   Schwartz ordered Popeyes: to reveal the information on which its
buyout offer was made and to stop using, at least for now, any
confidential Church's information it might have.
   The judge also ordered Popeyes to disclose the amount of money
the company had spent to buy and maintain an offshore racing boat,
corporate jet, helicopter, yacht, bus and luxury car used by its
chairman, Al Copeland.
   On Monday, Schwartz issued a temporary restraining order
forbidding Popeyes from pursuing the buyout until similar
disclosures were made.
   A Church's spokesman said the company would appeal the judge's
refusal to grant a permanent injunction against the takeover and a
preliminary injunction on the antitrust claims.
   Peter Butler, Popeyes' New Orleans lawyer, said Schwartz would
have all the information this week. He said he could not comment on
the claim that Popeyes' offer was based on insider information.
   Regarding the corporate expenditures for boats, planes and other
conveyances, Butler said: ``All those expenses have been treated as
legitimate business expenses by the business firm retained by Mr.
Copeland and been reviewed very carefully.''
